That's what my friends and I keep asking throughout this movie. We could not believe how stupid it was! I think someone recorded this on their camcorder at home, put it in the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would ever take it. Well, I think the joke is on us. <br /> <br /> I suppose you should have come first to this website and read all the reviews you have received, each one of them says that this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and incessantly. And boy, they're right! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs (my friends and I were quite drunk) because it is very stupid. We can not believe that someone was foolish enough to make such a horrible movie! I swear this had to be done in the 70s before they had good technology for movies and things because every scene seems really horrible, but when I looked here, did it say it was made in 2001? What? Sure it does not look like a movie that would be done today, but I guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and film home movies with strobe lights and really fake lasers, and instead you use real-life people from your city of actors or even aspiring actors. By the way, some of those chicks (or if they were drag queens, we could not say it!) They were so ugly, not even my drunk and horny college friends would touch them with a 50-foot stick. <br /> <br /> So there's absolutely no appeal for this movie, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time or your money on this, you will be completely disappointed.
