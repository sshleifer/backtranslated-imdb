I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which could influence my opinion about it. I've seen all the Dogme movies, and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story is intertwined with the themes of Shakespeare's play: King Lear, but he never manages to capture the audience and make them care about him. The direction of the actors is very vague, even for Dogme-style films, and results in an indefinable performance. The story lacks any dynamics, and I lost interest very soon. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to surprise the viewer, but I do not think they have improved the story at all. Mifunes sidste sang and Festen are dogmefilms that proved to be well directed and had good stories, so I hope to see better dogmefilms in the future. Maybe "An Invisible Man-Dogme 6" by Aake Sandgren results in raising the quality again. Because he is, like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen a trained and educated director.
