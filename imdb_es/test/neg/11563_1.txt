This movie is very bad. Most seem to have been filmed in a park or in a basement. There is a giant spider but all we see is a leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are simply cheap puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a lot of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that does not make any sense at all. Everything is simply laughable.
