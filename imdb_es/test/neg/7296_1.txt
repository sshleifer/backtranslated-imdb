I saw this movie with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> When the tape started, me and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the other end of this cave as an area. I told him to close his eyes and that it would not happen if he did not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds they began to scream. The faces of the Nazis melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds, the video tape came out of the VCR and landed back in its box and the top part closed. Me and my girlfriend left us unharmed. <br /> <br /> As a result of this experience, the videocassette was placed in a wooden box and stored in an enormous warehouse of identical wooden boxes, so that it would never be seen again.
