Fantastic in a completely new way, ANYTHING, BUT LOVE, should probably be seen by moviegoers, even if only as a precautionary measure that proves everything that can go wrong with a "vanity" production. I am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason in God's green land to choose the non-talented singer / actress and not particularly attractive as Isabel Gold in the role of protagonist, competing until now for people like "seekers "like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy, except that she also helped write this strange little movie. Their singing leaves a lot to be desired, and yet, incredible as it may be, all the other characters in the movie think it's great. There are some moments here of real charm or humor, but very few. Otherwise, this is a silly and sad fiasco that goes from painting by numbers to painting by wrong numbers. You know what it's like when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "My son could do better than that!" Well, this is a movie, like the one your child, or anyone else's, could do better.
