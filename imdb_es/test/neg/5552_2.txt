I love camp movies, believe me and Gordon Lewis's usual techno-gore does not bother me at all, but this is just one of his stupidest films, even more than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not kidding. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about an angry person who kills many girls in a nightclub. A detective and a reporter try to discover the great secret. Maybe the performances here are a bit better than the H.G Lewis movies that average, but that does not say much. The work with the camera is even frightening. <br /> <br /> But at least it's something you can see with Go Go girls acting ... you're going to have a good time with that, and the murders are just absurd in a very, very bad way : they kill a girl with a wooden hammer in the butt (!) and simply do not let me talk about what she does with her nipples. You will laugh like anyone with this. But the best of all this mess is a scene that I love only for its camping: the girl go-go before being attacked by many feminists who dance in a very American way. Although it is important to keep in mind that this was one of the first films that got an X rating due to its violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and have a good time (But only by much, A Lot of beers).
