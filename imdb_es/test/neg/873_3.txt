* Warning: 1 small spoiler inconsequential * You're right. This was not Madison County bridges. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere registered in the big empty hotel, it was an inevitable conclusion that something fun would happen. The question is: how will it arise? The answer is a stupid story of connecting the points that are not worth reading. In a supposed experience of union, they get drunk and clean the closet of the old cans (that was my spoiler). And the next day they returned them. LOL It was not convincing at all. I am an old woman married like the one in the movie and MY friendships are more interesting than HIS romance with Richard Gere. Hahaha . . He had that advantage. You move away and go, oh brother. . . Even I could have written something more credible than that. I guess my life is not as boring as I thought it would be if I could make fun of an affair with Richard Gere. Haha And that friend inherited that totally contemporary mansion, probably generated by computer, resting in the middle of the ocean, of her grandmother who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR? Maybe your grandmother is Oprah and this was the way after the Civil War? And yes, where was the email? In what alternative universe do these people live? I never want to see another movie that pretends we do not have email, Facebook and text messages. And it's okay, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to spreading news over the phone, but do not ask me to believe in anyone in this era of instant communication that someone falls into their life without calling first.
