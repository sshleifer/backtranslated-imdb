Do not bother to check the logic. There are none. But, on the other hand, there are MANY really cool movies that are totally lacking in logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and dislike this movie. I like it because the action sequences in the air are really great, you can see many dog ​​fights. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool airplane. <br /> <br /> But there are too many mistakes for you to really enjoy it. I think it's not fair to want some kind of continuity, since it's hard to make a good hunting movie, but I also think that there should be some sense of reason. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: do you fly from California to the Middle East in F-16 without refueling in flight? I would like to see that happen.
