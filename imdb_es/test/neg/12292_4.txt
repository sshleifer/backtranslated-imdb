I am very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. While it had some good features, for the most part I found that this film was heavy-handed, predictable and, worst of all, it did not scare the least bit. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress did a good job in her interpretation and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the movie went into a downward spiral. I entered this film without having any idea of ​​what it would be: I did not know anything about the actors, directors, genre, etc. At a certain point, my wife made the comment "is this supposed to be a scary? Movie?" Well, I suppose so, since the "horror movie" on the boiler plate full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could not mean anything else. There did not seem to be much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second half of the film descended deeply into the realm of the ridiculous. A film like this travels a dangerously narrow path and, unfortunately, there comes a point at which the viewer must decide whether to continue walking down that road or jump and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. For the last 30 minutes, I chose the latter.
