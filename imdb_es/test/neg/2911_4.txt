The pro-American propaganda film about the war effort that came out in 1942 makes the East Side Kids get tough on any Japanese they see in their own neighborhood when they discover they are too young to enlist. Ultimately, they learn that they were wrong in their mistrust of some people, but they also stumble upon a ring of spies that they then tried to destroy. The film is quite harmless in its style, although some may be offended since the innocent Asians were really featured during World War II. However, in general, it is a fairly generic effort and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would have better times, the best of which tend to come here when they are adrift.
