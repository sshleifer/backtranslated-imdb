Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss launched his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and dressing the Nordic god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and achieved a very popular status for its originality and pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell a party. MATCH. Why? Because I have to! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie "The Son of the Mask". Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he replies "Cuz I have to!" Unfortunately, that answer does not cover it because after seeing The Son of the Mask, he still left the theater thinking: "My God, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film must realize that the answer given to why he is making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate about whether to party or not. <br /> <br /> The mask's son begins when the dog Otis finds the infamous mask and takes it to its owner, Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary creator of Loony Toons, Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a troubled animator who works as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he hopes to win a day's draw. On the night of the company's Halloween party, Tim puts on his mask and transforms himself into the wicked and demented character we all hope for. After the party, Tim goes home, masks himself and conceives a son with his wife. Nine months later the chaos takes place, since the baby born of the mask has remarkable caricature powers. Otis, the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and participates in Tom and Jerry. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask under the orders of his father, Odin. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must admit that I respect the fact that this film pays as much homage to the classic cartoons as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous plot of the Frog type dancer. However, this reverence can not save the film and makes it less respectful and more like a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film becomes increasingly foolish. The foolish thing is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the stupidity reaches the point of being simply annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not fun. The opacity of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the best things about the original is that, while, obviously, computer animation was used, it was based a lot on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, it was a real caricature. Jamie Kennedy simply does not have that kind of ability, a fact that becomes clear when you see him wearing the mask and his facial features rarely change. The baby and the dog were mostly fully animated, which became more and more distracted throughout the film. The secondary history of Loki in search of the mask became increasingly amazing. <br /> <br /> The son of the mask is a sad state of affairs. What I suggest is that you rent or buy the original mask and thank the Nordic gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And I will consider seeing the sequel to my sacrifice while I continue to do the infamous question "WHY?" The son of the Mask gets a star, although that star must be divided between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.
