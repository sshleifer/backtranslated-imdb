Some spoilers **** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica approach intimacy it is a beautiful, discreet and truly erotic scene. I also loved the music and the soft and silent cinematography. I am not clear if the curious structure of stop and start of the film comes from its original digestion in serialized form (the speaker who describes the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is its rather absurd portrayal of a trans woman and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sex worker (what else), clueless, impractical, absurdly ruffled / feminine, completely desperate when it comes to dressing and unable to make any interpersonal bond in the world. In addition, he always shows up with two days of beard growth (for some strange reason) to emphasize how careless his life is. And he's waiting for gender reassignment surgery when he apparently has not done anything else to resubmit his transition. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the middle of the transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from abroad who are not really connected with trans people. The fetishization of GRS surgery in the film is a way to objectify people who are going through a transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At least, why not have the character played by someone who is really transgender? I thought that the male actor who played Veronica was fine, but not better than that. Much better was the woman who portrays Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-esteem, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with feminine energy, a Charlotte could go to a women's bar in two seconds and find her. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but more like an abstract idea of ​​someone with masculine / feminine characteristics (a soft touch but with a good blow), not as a single person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often charming and moving, but that does not mean that a stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped more in the process. dancers For such a promising premise (best performed in a movie like "Different For Girls"), the final film is a disappointment.
