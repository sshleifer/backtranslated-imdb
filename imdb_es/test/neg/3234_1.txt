The book "Observers" by Dean Koontz is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, the movie is a sad caricature of the book. The disillusioned middle-aged hero and single bachelor with whom he finds meaning in his life become the movie in a couple of silly teenagers, the stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff combine in a farcical villain. ? The filmmakers took a moving story of love, horror and adventure and turned it into a Z-rated horror film aimed very badly at the teen market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be much, much more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
