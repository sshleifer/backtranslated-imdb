I'm not even going to make more comments about this movie. Instead, I'll make a recommendation for all Euro-horror fans: if you want to watch a low-budget vampire movie, take a look at Nattens Engel (1998). It has everything that Razor Blade Smile lacks: performance, good places, excellent score and fewer vampire whistles ...
