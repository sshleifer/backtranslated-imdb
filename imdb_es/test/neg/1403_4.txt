This miserable psychodrama uses all the devices in poor condition in the book to attract attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, deserve no attention at all, let alone two precious hours of the filmmakers' time . <br /> <br /> As in Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" (an excellent film that, in comparison, clearly shows the emptiness of "Heroes"), a deceased adolescent has left his family in the anguish of duel. In this case, the death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisons the emotional well-being of the survivors in a particularly corrosive manner. We follow these people for the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually mute, usually drunk person who secretly says goodbye to his work for months, instead sits in a parking lot at the bank all day long insists on placing a full plate of food in the place of the deceased child for each meal. He treats all the other members of the family with unpleasant wickedness. He consults his doctor regularly, but the problem of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never arises. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Weaver) yells at the neighbor, among other people, that she is arrested when she tries stupidly to try. buy "marijuana" (your term) in a main store (what adult would actually try such a silly trick?), and, almost at the end, fall into a coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer (she he is an inveterate smoker). Ms. Weaver has a few lines, but in general she behaves in an unwise manner to deserve much empathy. <br /> <br /> It's not that there are not people who behave in these silly ways when stressful circumstances arise. But why make a movie of such nonsense? What can someone learn from the behavior of this pair? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is absent from college and is very happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, his causes are multiple and his behavior is consistent within the circumstances. But the character of Hirsch is too soft to speak, too moody and defeated, to take the film. The other bit players, subtexts and unreal and unreal dialogues do not help. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is repeated almost indifferently in the case of two other minor characters. So what is it that the writer and director, Dan Harris, is trying to say on this topic? What is not a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this script is something only his therapist could answer. Avoid this dog. Instead rent the Redford classic. My rating: 4/10 (C-).
