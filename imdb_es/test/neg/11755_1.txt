I know curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to watch Psycho's remake, especially after having been on a Hitchcok trip recently and getting to know his work. However, I have seen the original Psycho since I was a child, I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard the new version was "How to redo perfection?". I also stuck to that, but I think that now I have a more open mind and I thought maybe it was a way to present Psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But this became a total insult and a slap to the face of the original psycho. I know this has been said, but I saw the making of this film, and the director told me: "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by the original" ... what is the point? ! Okay, but I want to judge this movie for itself, even though it insults the original. I mean, the acting was not up to par, but honestly, it seemed that the actors only saw the original and simply memorized the lines from there and made it their own. <br /> <br /> Seeing how it developed. In this film, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, said: "I had never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus". Ooh, that made me angry, because, frankly, it's not just that, she really absorbed this role as Marian, it was not convincing, not to mention that the shower scene really was horrible. Vince Vaughn did not ... let's put it this way, the movie was horribly misspelled. This was a sin against the cinema and by itself, this was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could have been a new introduction for a new generation. But to Gus, leave the movie doing to who KNOWS WHAT IT IS DOING! <br /> <br /> 1/10
