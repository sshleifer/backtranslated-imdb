I should have left without seeing the movie after reading the review here. I watched the whole movie with a fast forward and finished in 25 minutes. Although it is a low budget movie, it could have been done better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts more like a thriller and in a few minutes tells you to turn it off immediately. And why was the movie called "hard landing" when it landed so well in such bad weather? <br /> <br /> Without any action, all the characters moved or did things like children. <br /> <br /> And you should not forget to comment on the prankster, the main kidnapper that would have been more appropriate if this movie was a full-time comedy.
