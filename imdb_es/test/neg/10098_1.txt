2001 was not perhaps Eric Roberts' best year. Both Raptor and this one came out. I looked at Raptor a while ago and I really thought it was horrible and that it was the worst of Erics. But that had its fun time and D-standard. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the worst actor these days. History lacks strength and everything feels even slower than a snail breaking curves. <br /> <br /> The two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. I could discuss if your effort is good or what, but compared to the rest, they are critical above all. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Roberts seeing it next time (and I hope it's better).
