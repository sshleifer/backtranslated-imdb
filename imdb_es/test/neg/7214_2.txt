Man stops making sequels of great movies. The original was a great movie that was above the fights, sex and one of the most brilliant characters that appeared on the screen in the 90s. The story is credible as if you had been in bars on the outskirts of the South that you would know. But here comes this piece of scrap Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Hopefully they are serious with the title and never create another Roadhouse again. It does not have the charm of the original characters nor is the story really believable. The story is more of a Steven Segal-type action that, although Roadhouse 2 is a B movie, still does not click, since some actions in the B movie still sell the movie no matter how cheesy. The only reason to rent this movie is that we finally discovered that the only question left of the original Roadhouse. The character of Patrick Swayze, Dalton, is Dalton his first or last name? Well I'll save you the rental fee of $ 4.00. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER DO ANOTHER ROAD HOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
