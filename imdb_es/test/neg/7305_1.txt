Okay, let's get to the point: there's no way I can give this something other than 1 out of 10; And yet you have to see it! The performance is bad, but it is not as bad as the script, which in turn pales before the production values. Cardboard shafts? Yes, we have then. Car mats painted silver and used as armor? Here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself is meant to be artistic, but it's cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly, especially in prolonged fighting scenes; There is (fortunately!) Very little dialogue, and there is a lot of "artistic" music to take home the horror! <br /> <br /> And yet, all this terrible is convincing: you have to keep an eye on it so you can. I can say you've seen it. I have not even got into the sterile sets, the "plot" or the laughable special effects; This is really the film school "how not to do it". This must be seen: spread the word, and allow the world to join the puzzle of what is happening at the end. <br /> <br /> The best thing, however, is that they made a sequel.
