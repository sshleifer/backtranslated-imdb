BELONG TO ME (1941) is an example of the "ScrewBall Comedy", which began in the mid-1930s and ended in the postwar period (WWII). Some of these movies maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when they were originally critics and box office failures. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this value that continues to decrease. <br /> <br /> Why can it take root in the story / script? Forces credibility from the beginning, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to the millionaire HENRY FONDA who is incredibly jealous. He would be happy to sit with his million dollars and love her, she wants to maintain her profession as a doctor. He wants it to become what his eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to entertain us. It can not be rescued either by the directors or by the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Faults in this scenario can be placed clearly at the foot of DALTON TRUMBO. The character of HENRY FONDA is written so widely that any viewer feels an instantaneous aversion for him. BARBARA STANWYCK has nothing to do but react to every idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO had to spend a lot of time outside the studio being a "useful idiot" and then he was at work. COLUMBIA, obviously, did not get his money from him, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should take over.
