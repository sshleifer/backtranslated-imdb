As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was named production manager in this film ... my first time! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Look carefully, and you can even see me in one of the initial scenes, like an asylum assistant who will be murdered soon and who will be called ... "Cely" (my own name). <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Hostages", this image was changed to "Another son of Sam" by the Producer-Director who wanted to charge the serial killer on the news at that time. Nothing could have helped. I do not even think that this image was good enough to show in "MST 3K!" <br /> <br /> The film was filmed mainly with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and old Arriflex handheld cameras. In fact, the helicopter shot during the hostage siege was filmed with my own era of World War II, Arri. The image was filmed entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina, in the mid-seventies. Most of the "Stars" were local TV presenters, and the rest of the crew had enough experience or was naive enough to believe the former doubles actor and producer and director, Dave A, Adams' supersession delusions. <br /> <br /> If you like to see these kinds of images, you might like the work of another North Carolina artist, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
