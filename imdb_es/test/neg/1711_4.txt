While traveling with a team of failures due to the Miss Galaxy dispute, the plane piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes in an isolated place, where Noah's Ark is protected by the Jurassic Pork . While the group struggles to survive, the alien monkeys plan to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an offense to human brains. The terrible story and the special effects are very, very bad indeed. There are parodies with "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Planet of the Apes", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Congo", "MIB", "Perfect" Storm "," Austin Powers "," Jaws "," Mission Impossible "," Close Encounters of the Third Kind "," Star Wars "and" Hulk ", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not very funny. . In the end, the trailer is better than the movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission almost impossible")
