I was looking forward to this movie. Being an old fan of Robert E Howard, mainly from a Conan point of view. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much and I thought that they could not spoil it too much ... Oh, my God, how wrong I was ... <br /> <br /> The main defect was pretty boring. I needed to be accompanied by a good helping of supernatural activities, sword fights and things like that. <br /> <br /> You had some blood, but everything else was lifeless. The central section seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with carts pulled by slow horses and even a dialogue and development of even slower characters! <br /> <br /> On the positive side = the costumes and the effects were fine, but not enough to keep their interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been better to mitigate the gore, increase the tempo and get a 12A rating. As a ten year old child, I may have liked this movie. Probably from the age I was reading Conan stories for the first time fun enough. Maybe that says a lot about my anticipation of the movie? <br /> <br /> OR ....... Really go to "Art-House" with tone, address, etc. But that is quite high risk to the extent that As for the box office. <br /> <br /> Oh, well ... Maybe the next Conan movie will compensate?
