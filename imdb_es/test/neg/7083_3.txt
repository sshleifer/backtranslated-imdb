Scarlet Dawn casts Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron abruptly displaced by the forces of the Russian Revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. It is also not very suitable for any kind of real work. <br /> <br /> Doug may have been caught by the Reds, but due to the fact that his former servant Nancy Carroll did not give it away. Nancy is very much in love with Doug and they get married once they arrive in exile in Istanbul, which throughout the film is referred to by her old Christian name of Constantinople. They get married and settle down with Doug now reduced to washing the dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' former mistress, Lilyan Tashman, who is always playing the bad girls of a kind in the movie, finds it and offers to regain some style once she was used as part of of a scam against the father and his daughter, the American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> The good thing is that this movie has an incredibly short execution time of only 57 minutes, usually those that were delivered to the B Westerns because they are tedious and melodramatic. The ending is quite incredible. Doug knew he was on a Thanksgiving special and he really exaggerated to cover the flaws of an incredible story. <br /> <br /> What I did not understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why did not he? Have you just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? That did not make any sense to me. <br /> <br /> I would only see it if I were a dedicated fan of any of the main players.
