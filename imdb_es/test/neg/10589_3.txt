This is a poor attempt to spin the old yarn "cons and good", which we have already seen many times. In fact, it reminded me of the American series "The Players", although not so good. Omar Epps is not as convincing as the hard man of the group, as is Ribisi, who in his attempt to be the fun guy gets lost along the way. However, the performance of the Danes was decent, and you can see in this performance, why it was chosen in Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD squad is a movie that is in a kind of gray area between the thriller and the comedy. Sometimes it is taken seriously, but other times it tries to be humorous, but it fails miserably. The film has a kind of feeling half finished, as if it had stretched to 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
