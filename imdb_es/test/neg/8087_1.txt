Rare and auspicious are the moments in the cinema when greatness stands as a monument that defines the rest of the industry to measure itself and immerse ourselves in that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories transcend your time. and aspire to the high limits of a classic and the material of legends. Incorporate the refined skills of a set of actors that are at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where has all the originality gone?" It is here, since this story and its cast are made through a plot and a story that will not only educate but also entertain the most experienced Shakespeare / action / love story connoisseurs. <br /> <br /> I can not begin to imagine where the writers dreamed this extraordinary story. Where do the geniuses get this kind of inspiration? Now I have hope for humanity, knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will reach the stars and beyond, perhaps at the gates of heaven. <br /> <br /> I have, like others Before me, dreamed of greatness. Although I did not write this film, I saw it and due to the nobility of this film, I feel that I have been elevated to a higher level of being, to a higher level of spiritual integrity. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that this kind of glory eludes most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach this level of magnificence? We would probably consume ourselves in a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolved into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing you should know, with all your heart and your heart. The essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is nothing I've been talking about. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. Since some reviewers rate a movie in a star system, that is, from 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I will qualify "Tomcats" as a black hole. <br /> <br /> I am willing to donate money to a cause that will put an end to this type of atrocities that, in recent times, seem to be malfunctioning at the box office. I am not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, rude, vulgar, unimaginative and degrading movies coming out of Hollywood? I will not even dignify this movie by mentioning the name of someone who starred or produced it. I'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it billions of times, and all the previous versions were at least a million times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost collapsed during this movie, but I survived to warn the audience with a supremely disinterested effort and good luck. You have been warned.
