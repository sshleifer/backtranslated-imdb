"Hero and the Terror" is a rather boring thriller - to the: there is no substance of real character, predictable plot and ... Bored. For a suspense film, I found that this film was slow to reach its sad climax, as it seemed to crawl until the baby of Chuck's wife is born ... and then it continues until the end, I can barely remember. and even though I only saw the movie 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10, during the first 10-20 minutes.
