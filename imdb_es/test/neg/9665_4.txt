We picked it up as part of a Brentwood set, under the title "The Broken Skull." Filmed directly on video, with a variety of sound quality and lighting, this film ends with an overactive quality that can inspire the viewer to feel nervous, confused and irritable, and not in a good way, "Evil Dead". br /> <br /> Without entering spoilers, what at first seems to be a simple story of revenge ghosts becomes increasingly intricate and strange. While there are some interesting ideas here, it is likely that the general effect will leave you scratching your head and saying "hello?" <br /> <br /> This is a very, very bloody movie. Gore effects range from full-blooded household appliances to a silly Video Toaster effect that must be framed by freezing in order to (dis) believe it. The level of "Fangoria" of the abrupt effects in this film is really incredible and should please the gore-hounds while someone with a weak constitution feels a bit dizzy. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull It is also an extremely noisy movie. It presents not only environmental noises (captured by microphones and not replaced in the pole), but there are many squeaks. No, no, I mean a lot. Much much! The characters scream, howl, howl and scream, laugh and laugh like crazy. Lower the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! But you can not criticize the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat the landscape and, sometimes, the effect is quite entertaining. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a lot of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few of the actors were made of wood. Some of them may have overestimated a bit (oh, just a little!), But most of them are certainly fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and congratulations to the filmmakers for that. The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful and exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the MST3k classic, "The Brute Man." Watch them see all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> To finish, the Headcrusher can not become a horror icon on par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie.
