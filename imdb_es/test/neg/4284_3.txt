The man kills the bear. The man becomes a bear. The man / bear meets the bear. The man / bear remains man / bear after meeting the bear. The end. Seriously, that's the whole plot of this movie. Yes, I simplified it to the extreme, but you get an idea. I just wish I had not seen him. <br /> <br /> The 'man / bear' alluded to is a Native American Indian who kills a puppy mother. And while that may be poignant, it certainly lacks a real attraction about the potential conflict between the two parties. In addition, there was some misuse of the two moose in the movie. But that is beyond the point. <br /> <br /> In general, well below the level. I certainly needed a lot more to be entertained. Maybe more laughs from the supporting characters and more drama between the two main bears. That is what separates bad films from good ones. "RE"
