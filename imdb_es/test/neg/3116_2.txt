First, I do not see how the film is on any of the "best" lists or how it won any awards. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on the "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This film was missing so many things, on so many different levels, but I can not explain why I did not like it that much. The main actor was upset, I felt like I never knew what was happening, and they bored me !! Although this was supposed to be a life change that was worthwhile that Pierre was starting, he wanted it to end ... ASAP. Why did he have to be his sister and his cousin? Ugh And why did Thibault become bad? It just became bipolarly bad. And also, was it me or did I miss the whole purpose of what that black guy was? Who were all those people who played music in the big basement of the big store? Why did they have all that strange equipment and weapons and all those extra rooms for people to live? I want to say this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in French culture? The European culture? I took 5 years to learn about culture and I never heard anything about it!
