So I decided to watch the whole Puppet Master series, and I had just seen parts 1-3, which I thought were excellent. They had a unique charm for them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. The demonic toys, which of course were bad, but they are still a great guilty pleasure and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie, I knew I was in trouble. The corny villain of the Egyptian Power Rangers skull who sees the style of Rita Repulsa of the Puppets through his pyramidal glass came straight out of the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly, we have a large assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was written, the writers had the vision of someday seeing an Egyptian villain of the Power Rangers, totemic monsters, annoying twentysomethings who really can not act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent), and a puppet "Decapitron" lame whose head can turn into the ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that disappointed me a lot in this movie was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn, again in his case (minus Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love for Elsa). This is not explained AT ALL ... and with that, and with all this other garbage thrown away, I no longer had fun. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B's ​​ridiculous movies, a connoisseur if you want. I even collect bizarre B-movie laser discs that you can not find on a DVD, so I have a hard time saying it was one of the the most absurd movies I've seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the originals, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if only they had followed what they had instead of trying to fix something that was not broken, well, the series could still be Live and with good health. That said, even though the reviews are not so good, I'm very interested in seeing Puppet Master Retro, it sounds like an interesting one that pays a great tribute to the original songs.
