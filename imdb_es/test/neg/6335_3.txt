Another film about a hardened adult who meets an adorable and intelligent child on the street (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And, once again, it's not funny or interesting, for everyone to see, children or adults. I'm sure some people can find this movie funny, but I have no idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work on this film, so that everyone else and their parents could earn some money at the price of a cheesy corny movie.
