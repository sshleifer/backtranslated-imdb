Okay, at the time of writing this article, 65 people voted for this movie, which led to a rating of 5 out of 10. My guess is that only the film crew voted. So I'm here to do justice to all this. <br /> <br /> Never a movie has caused the intelligence of the audience more than this. Given, I laughed a little, but the movie / story did not want me to do it. <br /> <br /> I've seen MANY bad movies. MUCH. But man, this surprises everyone. <br /> <br /> Talking computers from '96, ridiculous performances and wheelchair chases - and we have young tarantinos who can not get their ideas funded. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
