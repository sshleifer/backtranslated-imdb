If the following sounds tempting, then, by all means, hurry up to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie in a hurry: <br /> <br /> 1. Horrible 60s hairstyles, from pathetic permanent to unreliable ducktails . <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY with the most annoying voice you can imagine. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of stock images of alligators and monkeys that do not fit with the movie. Absolutely. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotyped Indians who use blowtorches and talk engulfed. Oh, and needless to say, they shout around a campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hilariously false plane crash mechanics where the plaster is thrown to the corners of the cardboard game. <br /> <br /> 6. The outside shots of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy plane with a string running around a studio illuminated with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. The terrible special effects that make those used in the first series of Star Trek look vanguard in comparison. (Special mention: the child's blond hair is shining Oh, darling). <br /> <br /> 8. Easy to use editing and continuity, where the background elements move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning, etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Do not you have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Make any lady on the street feel like an idiot! Nobody will notice the difference! Er .. <br /> <br /> 10. An 'exciting' climax involving quicksand, snakes (more things from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Do not forget to put a song with a stupid "tribal" sound! <br /> <br /> However, the most sensible among you, will await your inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic television show resurfaces and then can look at it in the spirit that was thought. Any other kind of enjoyment that comes from this shit is unthinkable ... not to mention that it does not work. So do not try it. 0/10
