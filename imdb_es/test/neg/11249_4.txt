Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as original, but it was just as fun. The film itself lacked small things that contained the original, which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another useless sequel made to bring money with a very thin plot. The terrible excuses of Cedric the Entertainer for the flashbacks ruined the film and seemed to be a bad way to try to make the audience adapt more with the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel that was not necessary, without the original charm, soul and spark.
