Around 1980, the name Godfrey Ho was attached to a series of low-comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name of Elton Chong. Although there are no masterpieces of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for stupidity. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely clear why Ho (or whoever it is) would want to make a film that would attack Jackie Chan's Drunken Master, the film that legitimized the making of comedy films in Hong Kong. But that's what this is, a savage attack on Chan's movie (the imitation of Chan who stars in this movie learns to make his opponents laugh at death, a trick without meaning in any genre). <br /> <br /> Along with all the faults one expects from a Godfrey Ho movie of this period - there is no continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot, irrelevant and incredible characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable failures that they effectively make it incomprehensible: the fight scenes stink, and comedy is not funny. <br /> <br /> No sense.
