I was very disappointed in this movie. Great actors, and potentially a great plot, but it seemed like it was limping. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her screen work was in car chases made with Austin Minis. The placement of the product went wrong, very badly. <br /> <br /> The address also seemed to deviate. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera passed over him, it took too long and Norton made a face or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us some credit! It is good to surprise us with a twist of the plot without having to telegraph it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I have always liked to appreciate the work and the talent that a film entails, but this one simply did not have it.
