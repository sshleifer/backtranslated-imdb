Well, in all honesty, it's beyond the limits of stupidity, but "Killer Pussy" is still an incredibly entertaining little movie. There is no plot, tons of greasy disappointments, effects of cheese and a monster that eats the penis! What could not be loved ?! More or less, a pair of explorers find this creature that likes to nest inside the curtains of flesh of a woman until, unfortunately, a schwang is ... ah, stuffed into her mouth. He finds his host, who is then discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of stupid guys and their equally brainless whore brides whose truck is broken. The creature jumps out of each girl while they fornicate like drunken rabbits ... There's a little cheap gore, "blood fight" from girl to girl, vomit from KY Jelly, puppet monsters from socks and lots of soft sex. Ridiculous but a cold waste of time ...
