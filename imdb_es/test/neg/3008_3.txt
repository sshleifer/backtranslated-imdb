There's nothing I hate more in a movie than pretense, and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made. Self-awareness is obvious in all frames: "see what a deep and sophisticated film we are doing", the director and the screenwriters seem to tell us, and they themselves say: "let's see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more". I would rather watch the worst Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer movie than something like this. At least they were giving us honest junk, and at least their movies, in their atrocious way, were entertaining. This movie is as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and therefore amounts to torture. <br /> <br /> Have these writers heard the word 'history'? It does not seem like that. They have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to put together an excellent cast and get good performances from them. And for what? To get bored for one hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, which lasts only about two minutes, happens when one of the homeowners who will soon be evicted starts firing at state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. But nothing comes out of it. Too bad he did not keep shooting until he hit the writers. The only redeeming characteristics of this film are the performance and some beautifully photographed landscapes towards the end. 3/10
