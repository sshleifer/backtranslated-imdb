OK, I just flipped the channels and trapped DW3. I saw it knowing that it would be garbage ... BUT ... as a person who has seen tons of movies, it stands out as one of the worst movies I've seen ... I'm not kidding. It's so bad that you have to see it, like an accident that you can not avoid. Sometimes, these kinds of movies work, IE, Troma movies ... but seeing Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson sweep it this way is painful ... What's even more fun is that I stopped in IMDb to see what other people say and really scores a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can not believe that 1.5 has passed! Just as funny is that it is not even the pinnacle of this series ... in some way this garbage guarantees parts 4 and 5? And to make matters worse, the comments of some of the guys here make reference to this as the best of the series and his favorite movie of all time. Statements like that scare me about this world!
