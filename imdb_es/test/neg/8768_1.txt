The other critic was completely correct about this. The writing was horrible, the performance was horrible, the subject was horrible. The actors seemed not to be really interested in the film, since they almost "had" to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really related to the story (or what there was in a story), and they did not occur particularly well. <br /> <br /> I guess they tried to take advantage of the success (can I say that?) of the other films with eschatological influence (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it DOES make Christians feel embarrassed when this kind of movie happens. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are not Christians.
