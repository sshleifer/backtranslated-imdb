I pulled this thing out of the science fiction shelf because I remembered seeing the first one in the series when I was a kid. I rented the second one and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. This was totally unpleasant. The "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two female helpers of cyborgs were so terrible that I literally shrugged each time they appeared on the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I do not know what others thought when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure it would have been better for them to leave it in 2 movies. The movies in this series go from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist group has access to this film because it is an excellent torture device.
