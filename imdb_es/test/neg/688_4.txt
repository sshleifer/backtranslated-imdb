Following his role in the SEVEN THIEVES (1960) thin cape, which I have seen several years ago, Edward G. Robinson seemed to be caught playing the elder mental brain types (apart from the strange juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965] ). Previously I had seen the very good effort "Euro-Cult" of GRAND SLAM (1967) and, apart from this, I still have two similar titles from Italy to verify, one of which was directed by the future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production, with American and Italian actors and a British director, which prevailed during the 1960s; It is harmless and simple in itself, but hardly memorable and definitely too long, especially because to obtain funding for the heavy equipment required for the robbery (such as an army tank and an airplane), the gang involved has to throw away a variety. of minor thefts first. <br /> <br /> The gang, of course, is an incompetent group led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch); the others are a black man 'pacifist', an Italian perennially hungry and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to give them his fortune, except that he is destitute ... but, under the auspices of "Professor" Robinson, he proposes, instead, a platinum caper from 5 million dollars! Needless to say, gang members do not trust each other (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica in order to obtain the name of his fence in Morocco, where they must retire after the robbery). To hold a restaurant, the Italian can not resist sitting at the table and ordering himself a multi-course meal!). Surprisingly, in the face of similar faults, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days. However, apparently holding a gas station, it follows that the owner is a nephew of his and simply asked to borrow some money! <br /> <br /> The sequence of the central robbery is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, "takes" the train carrying the platinum, Wagner kidnaps the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the job is over, he intends to cross over De Sica completely, but neither his colleagues nor Welch herself are willing to accept this, so he is forced to give in. From the moment the crime did not pay, the gang manages to lose all its hiding place in the air when the doors of the bomb bay of the plane accidentally open ...
