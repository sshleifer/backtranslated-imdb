... a film appears that manages to be absolutely terrible from the initial titles to the studio logo labeled at the end of the final credits. This was a film of this type: the same guy who can not stop seeing for fear of missing a moment of its always descending quality. <br /> <br /> Forget the low budget indicated by a slow and monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running next to a presidential caravan without crowds, no traffic or discernible location. Forget about the messy logic necessary to even make the actual plot seem plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider offers some of the most comfortable dialogues and fails to hide his embarrassment. <br /> <br /> This clunker has a terrible rhythm, is bombarded by a score that is simply ridiculous and seems edited by a third grade student. All the while twisting scenarios to cover up the most difficult part of filming a low-cost presidential story: make it look presidential. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I feel briefly asleep on the last roll, and when I woke up, I ran backwards so as not to miss a single unbearable picture. Try this drinking game: take a picture every time you see it blatantly making an imitation of another movie much better. You will also fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Not since 'The Man' with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy have I seen such an incredibly irredeemable project. I can give copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs
