Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor join in this comedy about nightclub owners who are being pressured by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this unpleasant journey of the ego, and therefore has no one to blame but himself for his failure. This is a really bad movie, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it only serves as an example of Murphy's contempt towards his audience. It would be very easy to continue hitting this movie, but I will show him more mercy than he showed his audience and I will stop now.
