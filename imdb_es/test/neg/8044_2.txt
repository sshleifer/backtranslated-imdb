Bad political action. Badly photographed, acted and directed. All the scenes are underlined, including the very few that are recorded during the day. It does not matter what the location is. At a major conference in the White House, there are no lights on, and the only available lighting is a dark blue that filters through some windows. The most primordial of China conducts a telephone conversation that breaks the earth in conditions of chiaroscuro so intense that he should see a bust of Homer in a painting by Rembrandt. Honest. It is as if he had a small focus on his face and, otherwise, was in total darkness. Slow-motion deaths are already mandatory in any ill-conceived film. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo perform well in their roles, but Scheider rarely appears on the screen. The other actions are disposable. There's a pretty Oriental woman in a short tight skirt who pulls out a gun and comes out of a Bond movie whose accent suggests a childhood in Basset, Nebraska, and that should have been the model she probably started as. The surviving Secret Service player aboard the cruise was probably chosen for the role because he looked more like Johnny Depp, not because of any talent shows. The Chinese villains, who represent Taiwan and mainland China, whistle and smile while threatening the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty horrible, recycled from other best movies. There are many shots aboard the ship and practically all end up in minced meat. Two thirds of the way, the ship explodes in the expected series of fireballs. Then the film is divided into two related parts. Part one, another shooting, this time in a warehouse facing the sea. The second part, an exchange between the vice president, the acting president and the oily Chinese premiere, emerged from "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe". Without knowing it, we launched our missiles. They throw theirs in retaliation. We can not convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even a general of George C. Scott / Walter Matthau who argues that his "nuclear" armory can not match ours, so we should hit them with everything we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end does not come too soon.
