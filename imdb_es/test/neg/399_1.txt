I entertained to see that some of the reviews here were surpassed with ** SPOILERS ** The joke of my family is that the only part of this film that is not mentioned in the back of the box, is delivered in the title. Maybe it's just a dense 17-year-old American who would not know the art if I bit my leg, but I prefer movies that have at least a few words. This film makes the second half of 2001: a space odyssey is talkative. This movie is so slow that it's not even art, it's just boring. We follow this creepy guy who follows this boy through Venice. The ending was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not make you refer to the book, you should be able to be alone. This movie has no way of stopping. He does not even have the bones of a plot to lean on.
