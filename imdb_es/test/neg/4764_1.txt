This film is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful virus created by man. They are chased by government men into the desert. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite interesting, but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. At no time does the film interact with the viewer at any level. Of course, the minuscule budget is a problem, but it is not the reason for the film's failure. Much more at fault is the very po-faced delivery. There is a lot of narration but, unfortunately, the narrator has a too dramatic voice. It seems that these people will spend very little and, before it ends, will be supporting the men of the government: the sooner they kill the protagonists, the sooner the film will end. A much better title for this movie would have been Four people run in the desert with some images of a helicopter. In general, very tedious.
