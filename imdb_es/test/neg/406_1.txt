I picked this up because, after spending some time in the Albany region of New York, I met a couple of people in the movie and found it by chance. The comedy attempts are boring, the mandatory scene of girl with girl is disgusting, the plot is non-existent, the performance is one of the worst I've seen in my life and I do not even mean special effects. I realize that this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company, but if you're going to make a sci-fi horror movie with giant bugs, do not make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. People want to see giant insects. That's half the fun right there. And if it's going to make the giant insects completely incredible, at least make the actors make a kind of ironic allusion to that fact ("Idiots! These are not them! They've captured your trick! Doubles!") . Prepare to waste two hours of your life that you can never recover.
