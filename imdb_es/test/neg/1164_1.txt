This is the worst movie I've seen and believe me, I've seen many bad movies. I love the horror cheeesy but this was just terrible. There was not a scene in this movie that scared me. All actors must have been people they met at a bus stop 20 minutes before filming. I wish Blockbutser had returned my 99 cents. The performance was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to project this movie before it was released and I had to know it was terrible. I would be ashamed to have my name associated with this monstrosity. Do not rent this movie. If you do, do not give it back so that no other poor soul will make the mistake of renting it.
