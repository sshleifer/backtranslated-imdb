I felt that the film Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things that people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes from these actions; However, I feel that it was not complete or the attention remained. He never got completely into the plot or delved into the emotions or reasons of the character behind his actions. The only thing I found more in the attention of the film was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the film were only the two main characters sitting or doing their daily tasks and without even having a conversation. I understand that this was to show the reality of these people, however, I feel there are other ways to show reality and make it entertaining. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a more fascinating way.
