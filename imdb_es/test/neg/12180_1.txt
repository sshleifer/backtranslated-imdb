Charles Bronson has given the viewers many great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything that a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are very bad. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? Not at all, it's my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very simple and boring, and although I'm a big fan of movies, I almost fell asleep several times. I do not know how they came up with a fault like this. A low budget, maybe? In spite of that, it seemed that all the actors had no interest in participating in the film. When that happens, the result is really bad.
