Julie Andrews satirically plays her own image of two shoes in this super-production musical comedy, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she is alone in that. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is a music artist and a German spy during World War II does not know what tone to point to, and Rock Hudson has the ungrateful task of playing a romantic background role. The musicals had grown out of favor in 1970, and productions of elephants such as "Star!" and this movie really tarnished Andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in his catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" appeared. I have always thought that Julie Andrews would have been a great villain or a somber lady; his strong voice could really attract attention, and he plays some low notes that can be imposing or seductive. Husband / director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can accumulate much energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and neither of them has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just a fabulous sequence: a striptease. * 1/2 of ****
