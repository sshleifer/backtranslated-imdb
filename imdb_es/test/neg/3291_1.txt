You have seen the same tired and worn clich√© stories of comedies, characters, stories thousands of times before, only that it stands out more sucking than others. In the first place, there is not a single character in this show that is even remotely pleasant ... in particular, that of Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest ones to win a TV screen ... disgusting, it comes to mind. If in real life a father were so unpleasant, cruel and generally unsuitable for the father ... fratricide would be his only option. Call stereotypes to the remaining characters, it would be too complementary. If these characters ended up in life support, the line to pull the plug would last for light years. How this show ended a full season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and keeps this in the air ??? Tell me the terrorists are not winning.
