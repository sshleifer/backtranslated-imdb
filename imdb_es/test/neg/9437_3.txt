This has to be considered as one of the most popular television shows in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jos√© Ferrer played the main character, Nemo. He did the part of justice and it certainly seemed the part. But today, I am surprised that the Nemo was made to be more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, of television commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly overcome by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to have passed his "penguin" days of Batman. Although here he does not do his "talk" of penguins, he is unparalleled like the maniac teacher. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica, chewed the landscape better as a maniac despot. <br /> <br /> I can never remember what was the rancor between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since Prof never missed the opportunity to try to cheat Nemo and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The effects were nothing special, although Prof. Cunningham's submarine was much better than Nemo's. He also had a crew of strange fish-shaped amphibians who served Cunningham and carried out all his orders. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He always said "Do fire delta!", Whereby a suspect crew member would horribly void the movement of firing the weapon with a full shrug. It really has no price! They no longer do so, and perhaps as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have a loving place, although covered in cheddar cheese, in our hearts.
