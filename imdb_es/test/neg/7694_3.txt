what a shame our first movie is so bad .............................. hi, what did you do in this movie: (... It's awful! And the director :( .. there's no story in this movie, I slept when I was watching this movie ... It's a disappointment, and most of the team is not from Saudi Arabia, it's supposed to be a comedy movie , but it lacks the essential elements of comedy, <br /> <br /> I know it was the first cinematic experience in Saudi Arabia, but I expect something better from Kaif Al Hal. The only positive thing in the movie is the presence of some talented actors who did not help the text much to exploit their talents Finally ... I want to know your comment about this movie, guys, is it bad or what?
