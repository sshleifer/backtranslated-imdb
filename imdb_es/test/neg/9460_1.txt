Before watching this movie I thought there were two types of bad movies. (1) Your average rate, completely uninspired (ie "Constantino"), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so bad, is good (to the "Hands of Destiny Hands"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore," I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the shitty sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed in your memory. A job that is incredibly execrable. Anathema <br /> <br /> I have hated certain movies before, but I have never hated a movie so much that my aversion reached its threshold and became an aversion to myself. Have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret having lost the time you spent watching it, but it makes you cry one more hour after that? The disciples of Mystery Science Theater are careful, this is a cinema that sucks souls. Go rent "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
