Sending the Critters to space seems to be an entertaining idea, but was there really a need for a third film, let alone this fourth one? A movie with Brad Dourif can not be that bad, right? Well, maybe in this case. This effort of cheap science fiction stars the adorable klutz Charlie (the reliable Don Keith Opper) who is about to eradicate the last two eggs of the Critters species when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him that he is about to break some kind of Trans . - Law of species in danger of galactic extinction. So at Ugh's request, Charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space capsule. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damn thing goes into space and is trapped inside. The smoke under his feet puts him in a state of hibernation and he wakes up 53 years later inside a decrepit space station <br /> <br /> as Captain Rick, with fat cigar, coarse and greedy alcoholic malevolence to the bottom Space Pod is opening its fire trying to see what's new inside for possible sale or trade. Rick, unknowingly, releases the two bugs that delight in his flesh. You see that Rick and his team found the space capsule drifting and they had intense dollar signs blinking in their eyes to match. Ugh informs them (now in a prominent and prominent position as a Counselor) that money can be made if they dock in a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew docked, they discovered that this station is in ruins with many corridors in poor condition, but what is worse is the station's computer, Angela. Angela is a real thorn in the side of the crew because it has not been repaired without proper maintenance for some time. Some small tricks are required to open and close doors, not to mention elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, more or less the manager of computer functions (... and is practically the true leader of the group, since he is the most sensible and intelligent). He seems to be a father figure for Ethan (Paul Witthorne) who only wants to reach the earth to find his father ... although this story does not necessarily reach its zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is mainly in the film to be a victim of drug addicts for bugs to eat. In the movie, Charlie, after a bug enters Rick's mouth and eats his throat {yuk}, it becomes the crew's guide to understand what they are fighting against. The film has some elements that I found quite confusing (or, rather, ridiculous). The two creatures grow in size quickly, somehow they are able to coordinate a ship for Earth, not to mention that they grow to a massive size in this laboratory. The space station. The crew can access a record of a Dr. McCormick {Anne Ramsay, whose badge is in a coat thrown next to which Ethan discovers his access card} showing signs that Terracor was looking to create a species to exterminate worlds and people Knowing this bothers Al Bert, who wants to leave Angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. Things do not work that way because Charlie, who has good intentions (thanks in part to the "old" Colt .45 of Al Bert) kills a creature that had climbed aboard, but when firing several bullets hits the main guidance systems in the ship. There are so many repairs in order, but they are stopped when Ugh and his stormtroopers dock at Angela and prove they are not what Charlie thought they would be. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the Crites for cruel purposes (representation of corrupt corporate government types?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie ... maybe he has grown a little (a little bit) and now he understands that some people simply change for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will face these creatures ... Can the crew escape from a space station that has self-destructed? This movie really does not exploit bugs as much as the other three movies. I think we can clearly see this as the true end of the franchise. The first movie was hilarious ... a really entertaining game. But, by the time this sequel started, the creatures simply wear out. The cast, however, gives the movie a boost. The bugs feed a bit, but their plans for global domination are poorly developed. His role in the film is not established at the greatest heights. I said to myself, you have this huge space station with unfortunate trapped on board ... could not you take this idea and run with it? Unfortunately, they do not.
