Really impressive, and some hot girls with swords flying around, ah and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I liked CTHD a little, with its realistic simplicity and well-developed characters, which still leave enough space for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the meaning of DEEEPAA. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Hero" is painful Pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. The greatest morality that life was horrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your powerful nation can triumph. WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No, thanks. <br /> <br /> But, hay, Mao and G.W.B. I would be proud! <br /> <br /> Live
