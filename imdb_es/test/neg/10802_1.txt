But at least this film got what it deserved: to be sent to the Love Satellite to be ridiculed by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". "Soultaker" is one of those lost and forgotten movies that are so bad that you are guaranteed to have nightmares or depression in the future. Although the movie is not that old, it's still a kind of forgotten movie. If it had never been for smart minds in "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not only seem like it never was made, but the film would not be very nice for the viewers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. In the satellite of love: this movie is excellent!
