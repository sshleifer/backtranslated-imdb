It's been more than 30 years, but I still remember that this movie was the worst I've seen in my life. I thought that something worse would have been filmed in this period of time, but I was wrong. I just finished watching "STARSHIP TROOPERS" and got a lot closer, but it was even more entertaining than "POOR COW".
