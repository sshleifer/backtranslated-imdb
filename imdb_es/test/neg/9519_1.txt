What can I say about this movie? It is really one of the worst gay-themed films, which have left the UK. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed the money. The story there is such a disaster that you lose interest quickly. It is supposed to be based on real life events. Well, all I can say is that it's an insult to real-life characters. The DVD is available at the moment in the United Kingdom. It is available in a split-screen format, which should make the full-screen version I see even worse. Gay movies can be much better than this, and we deserve more.
