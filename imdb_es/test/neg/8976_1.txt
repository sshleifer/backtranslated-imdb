Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a love festival for the murderer, without any sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with her completely unilateral vision, only reinforced my opinion that she should have been executed for her crimes. He tried to argue that he had mental retardation, but nothing in the video supported that vision. He seemed uneducated, but so did his entire family, but that does not mean they were all retarded. I can fully understand if someone opposes the death penalty, but completely ignoring the crime, as if it had not happened, and trying to put Wanda on top of a moral mountain, is offensive in nature, and that's not the side The problem with which it would be associated.
