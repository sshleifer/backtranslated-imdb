Recapitulating: A gang of five young Americans, all that remains of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during World War II gets the job as an advanced outpost and to look for enemy activity. They are in very poor condition, both physically and mentally, and believe they have found gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once luxurious mansion full of food. But after a while there is some enemy activity, and it's very strange. Not hostile, but strange. It seems that there is a German squadron out there, in bad conditions, that wants nothing more than to surrender. <br /> <br /> Comments: Based on a novel and I suppose the novel is much better, but the story does not seem to translate very well to the big screen. In fact, it's a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure in times of war than the struggles and battles. But I can almost feel that the scenes that must be full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat on the film. It is not suspense, only different and in many ways absurd. Many times people simply act crazy, and the reasons are unclear or, at best, insinuate themselves. <br /> <br /> Then, when this mental pressure does not manifest itself, the main piece of the whole story, I thought the story fell. through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me to the limit and it did not really send a message. Actually he did not do anything. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors who later became stars at the beginning of their careers. The acting is good, but not stellar, and some characters also fell into the absurd zone. A lot of that also I think is because this story, these characters need the time, space and rhythm that are given in a novel, which can not be given here. And going to the middle is definitely not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
