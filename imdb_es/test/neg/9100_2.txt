Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them there is a kind of Burdel story of Operatic in which a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people so that they become moments of happiness; only his attempt fails, it is only a real objective, the woman with whom he seeks. In the same unfinished castle he built, a group of teachers seeks love in a more modern story, as a woman ineffably believes in the role of romance and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by preparing her with the biggest imbecile. the group. Meanwhile, a group of children fantasize about an adventure similar to that of George Melies of a prince who saves a girl in distress from the creatures of the swamp and then kills the evil king, bringing the kingdom of love. The two main themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie really is. Resnais is the type of director in which often the concept is good or bad, but what matters is the exhibition; Here, the concept is great, but the movie is frankly painful to watch. Horribly detuned songs, bubbling characters without an ounce of dimension, disgusting pastel backgrounds: Instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais chokes it in a bucket of icing cake. Add a bit of French philosophy and you'll get a weird mix of witches, one that does not create bubbles of effort and trouble, but feels sick in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a risk-deciding director, and even at its worst you can see that it is trying something that might not work with all clarity of action. In I Want Go Home, he manages to bypass the annoying characters and ditzy, showing some real changes and having a few moments of silence to catch his breath. Here you are immersed directly in a fantasy that does not really reflect fantasy, just the wallpaper reference of your baby's room. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more extravagant than a pop video of the 80s, and more kitsch than the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood. The fantasies are more than childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and blasphemy) is definitely aimed at adults, a goal that definitely lost. <br /> <br /> However, he stays very close to his subject and never backs down. In any case, this movie is impressive simply because it does not apologize. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
