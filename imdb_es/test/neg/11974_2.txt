... with a budget of $ 500 and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of C movies without talented actors, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and bad camera work, this film delivers. <br /> <br /> Everyone else will be warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your yard and a camcorder at home. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is good for some laughs. Check it out with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 for involuntary comedies. <br /> <br /> Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with fewer lines and writing this is just a bit boring.
