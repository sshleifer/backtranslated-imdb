This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lose there daughter? with the poltergeist overtone rip? he just pushes it over the edge with stupidity. I saw it on the showtime, so I still had soft core cheese porn scenes. I have to say that it made me laugh my ass. The 3D effects of the 80s were very out of place. Including an invisible cat and a rotating vortex. Wow, I wonder if the people who did this really feel fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the wife seems familiar but still sucks. Their screams could be used as a torture device in hell no matter how much the retired Nazis. Anyway, thanks to the show time for the super horrible horror movie. I will always enjoy the time I saw most of the time and the money I have seen.
