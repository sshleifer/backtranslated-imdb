This has to do with one of the most pathetic, predictable and badly performed movies I've seen in my life. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I've never seen someone less convincing on the screen. I was laughing at him all the time. Then there is this romance between him and the magnificent Rene Russo, who was even more pathetic than Mr.Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> An IMDb user asked the question: What do I not like about this movie? I'm asking: What do I like about this? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He's an absolute genius and probably the best villain in the movie (he even saved Con Air, you know). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is called In the line of fire, but 'Bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. Look only if you're a John Malkovich fan. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
