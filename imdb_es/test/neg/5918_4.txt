The film by Peter Yates, from the pen of Steve Tesich, is a low profile thriller that really does not manage to take off. The story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the ensuing involvement of a pathetic Vietnam veteran (James Woods) who, according to police, may have taken revenge on his former employer. As an "eyewitness", William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of such an act. <br /> <br /> Hurt is far below his usual strength, and one finds it difficult to sympathize with him or with an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a little better in their support roles. Note the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance disguised as a mystery movie. The plot is too artificial. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
