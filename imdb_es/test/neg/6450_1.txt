Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wanted to make a heartfelt and moving Christmas movie, it's as cynical and scary as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, clueless adults and foolish villains. Production values ​​show that this was filmed with few resources or by inexperienced filmmakers. I suspect that the latter, unfortunately. The worst part, curiously, is really music. You would think that someone with a long musical career could do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. Even my mother did not like this movie, and she likes Osmonds and sappy things.
