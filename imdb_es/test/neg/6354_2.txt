They must be. I will list them so you can review them one by one: <br /> <br />: The police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars in cash and drugs everywhere, because they have no evidence of facilities. <br /> <br /> - When you are shot, you always growl in the same way and fly again in the same way, even if there is never a mark on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are not able to identify the sound of gunfire, and do not think anything is suspect when the call of a covert police officer during a high-level drug and money deal is is affected by that shot. <br /> <br /> - Bad-armed men can hit mannequins with a shot, but they can not hit a large and bulky martial artist with 100. <br /> <br /> - If you throw a car in a parking lot in a parking lot, the next three cars in a line will fly evenly at 15-second intervals. <br /> <br /> - Beyond the last point, all cheap cars are always parked side by side. <br /> <br /> - The smoke caused by the launch of the rocket is much greater. and the amount of smoke caused by four cars that explode. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are far ahead of everything that any other gaming company can produce on five floppies. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are far ahead of everything that any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like the Windows 3.1 screen savers. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can be read even after they were shot. <br /> <br /> - The semi-drunk guys in bars watch the news attentively when they're in the pub, and they have a deep knowledge of the modern military history of the United States, Agent Orange, and The Family Trees of senior military officers. However, they can only articulate their points through a dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Even though the fights seem to explode almost every hour in a bar, that bar has only one employee of the staff, who pours the beers and takes care of the security. Of course he knows martial arts. <br /> <br /> - The Olympians gold medal regularly makes the simple transition to corporate CEOs of software companies in a matter of years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a videogame company knows all about how to beat a game she has never played, she constantly praises the big games of her competitors and can unravel data and figures about the rivals of her company, but I did not know that they outperformed almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys always die in slow motion. Forever. <br /> <br /> - Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant by the courage of their man's bravery in killing the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives do much of their husband's police work; This could explain why she complains and complains so much every time he has to go to work. Although he does not explain why he adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and can read about his murderous adventures. <br /> <br /> - It is quite typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnapping, killing tons of people on three different occasions and stopping a variety of illegal multi-million dollar deals in a week. <br /> <br /> - When trying to lose a car that is following it, it is prudent to continue driving under the speed limit. And if you're following a cop, subtlety is not important: you can follow him for miles and then park right next to him. You will not notice. <br /> <br /> - All the cops are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a man four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or growl in pain when they are punched or kicked, but when they break their arm, they do not make a sound. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys clean their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pockets for many days. <br /> <br /> - The pieces of wood, when swayed with a strong blow, break the resistant stairs in six or more places simultaneously. <br /> <br /> - The photo and the special features listed on the back of the DVD box do not necessarily have to be on the DVD. The interactive menus announced? Why there is no menu at all! The announced scene index? Why not have it all as a scene / chapter, and do not need an index? Likewise, it is fine to use the source and title of The Matrix on the label line, and not be a scam in any way. <br /> <br /> With all this, I am shocked that 12 of each of the 15 best accredited actors never took action again.
