I like Ali G.'s program. I think the boy has a comic instinct, but (still) he has not developed it as a talent. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little worse than I expected. I do not find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for children of 5 years, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that seems "offensive", but that is actually fun, check out "Freddy Got Fingered" by Tom Green. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
