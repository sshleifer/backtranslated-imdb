Maybe in his day this movie was special. But five decades later, it seems picturesque, just another film relic of the terrible fifties. Stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three gold seekers who settled in a Manhattan attic, in an effort to attract wealthy spouses. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the superficial topic. But the premise of the film is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I found little to laugh at. The plot point on an extremely myopic bimbo is the only intelligent element in history. The general dialogue is flat, and so is the delivery. And the structure of the script is disconcerting. The plot continues jumping from one side to another between the three ladies. It is as if the writer could not mix the roles of the whole. The result is a plot that seems ragged. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her shrill voice and her horrible hairstyle, was simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Color cinematography is conventional. But there were many shots with the projection of the back screen, which contributed to an outdated look. The images get worse with the disguises that reek of the cheesy "glamor" of 1950; they are simply horrible. Spectators must endure a fashion show, a plot point that amplifies how the director of the film was hit by those poor quality rags. <br /> <br /> And then there's that orchestra. In what is possibly the worst movie to be released in the history of cinema, the first part of the film has an orchestra that plays a melody that sounds sad. At first, I thought I was watching the introduction to the next attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra is still playing, and continues, and continues. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, what has to do with history. What were you thinking? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe, her voice breaking, as she worked her way through the plot. But the film would have been much better if they had abandoned the other two roles as a whole, they would have left that orchestra, they would have improved the dialogue of the comedy and they would have played down those flashy and cheesy costumes.
