This is one of the worst movies. There's a scene where they're supposed to be underwater and they're literally walking on land and adding bubbles! The shark is boring and it's just this slow computer generated thing, a silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this boy work? The address is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in all the movies. I love shark movies and it disappoints. I have seen movies in this study before and everything they do has a star in their way doing a bad job. I prefer to see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
