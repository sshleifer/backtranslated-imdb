I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a movie made for television. I only saw it because I do not have cable and my other options were Golf, College Basketball or local news. The plot is very generic and does not have any substance that I can see, not to mention that I had a major defect in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is a washed astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will hit the Earth, causing the whole life to cease. He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an aborigine (I'm sure I misspelled it). The paintings show an apparent timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the building of the Great Wall of China. All events are displayed in perfect chronological order, and the last image on the timeline is the destruction of the Earth. Now, for me, if the painting showed things that had actually happened, why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? Leaving that aside, the film moved with extreme formula precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good, and sometimes I felt that they did not even take the film seriously enough to try hard enough to convince me that it was worth worrying about the characters. The whole movie was surrounded by clich√©s and an absolute waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon about this piece of garbage any day. At least Armageddon has a good performance (compared to this), not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, golf is not so bad .......
