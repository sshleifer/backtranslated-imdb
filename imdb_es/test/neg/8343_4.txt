This movie is fine, it's pretty silly and should be taken lightly. But what I can not stand are the many heroes and ILLEGAL SENTIMENTAL comment of that boy near the end: "look, everyone looks the same". Is not that good taste by far? I thought it was disgusting, as were the heroic and disinterested acts of some of the people in this movie. I'm not saying that it does not happen that way, but getting close to all the courage so turns my stomach.
