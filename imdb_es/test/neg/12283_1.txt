One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AMATEUR". For a film set in the 1800s, everyone talks as if it were the 1990s. Performance, particularly the people who play the masters of white slaves, is horrible. After about an hour in this movie, I left. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better film on this subject, see the much superior "Friendship" of Steven Spielberg.
