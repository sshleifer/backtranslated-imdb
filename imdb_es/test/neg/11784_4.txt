Irwin Allen put all his talent behind him: he is co-writer, producer and director of this "epic" cartoon about an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce a ring of radiation that surrounds the Earth. The potentially exciting story does not take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players, from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden, are intermingled in an interesting way and provide a touch of color, but this soggy science fiction is pretty corny. Well for a few laughs, but Allen did not seem to know the difference between a solid and solid adventure and a silly countryside. Later a popular television series. ** since ****
