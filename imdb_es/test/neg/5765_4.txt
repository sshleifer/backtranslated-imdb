This is a disgraceful review of the same plot in the ninth series of idiots, young adults in danger, because they are idiots in the film of the beginning of the millennium: this time we have the story of a crazy miner who returns from the dead to recover his gold from the hands of the usurpers. We almost have no emotions, almost no flesh (even if the girls are very hot, only one of them shows her bare bottom for a few seconds), the usual group of boulevard terror stars at sunset in cameo papers (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), a lot of fake blood, only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to leave him trapped, well, not exactly, on the screen until the end. Do not waste your time if you are not a completista.
