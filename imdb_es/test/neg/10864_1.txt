This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and recently I've seen Starship Troopers 2!). I could not find anything to redeem this movie. The performance, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen takes it in his standard character character. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he is supposed to be. The accent of Vinnie Jones is strange. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. His performance is quite poor, but I doubt that's why he is there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is truly atrocious. It is simply garbage. I do not know who signed this, but they really need to get professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This movie is the reason why the IMDB rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
