I am surprised by the main comments here for this surf movie OK. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school from corral to beach antics and it's not really plausible. The idea that the leader child learns to assemble a board so well in a concrete wave pool that beats the real surfers in his game in the real ocean, is just nonsense. In Australia, where most urban teenagers surf, this movie laughed at the public and took it all with a grain of sea salt. Made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s, it's fun to watch, look and sound good, but it's not a classic class. Even the actors did not survive this. We are seriously in LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO land here. Oz stars like Occy and BIG hero Wednesday Gerry Lopez are recruited to add a head nod to our farmer's wave prowess, but it only made the crowd at the movies laugh. It is for children of 10 years who do not question much. It is not even IN THE HANDS OF GOD and that was also nonsense.
