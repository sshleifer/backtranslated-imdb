During an eight-year period in the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do', a collection of TriStar Films from ITC Entertainment's Sir Lew Grade. Bronson was already at the center of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which was developed through numerous activists until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should be quite high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better funded ITC team, but 'The Evil That Man Do Do' is a big disappointment on many levels. Although still in the low budget, the cast of the B movie of the 1980s, 'Evil' has a tempting potential for a great movie. However, everyone in the production department took an easy exit and sold the work of pirates that did not deserve Bronson's footprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of the best Bronson and Thompson films, but instead, it will become one of its most average. <br /> <br /> This 1984 Political / activist thriller opens up brutally with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, who celebrates his special training class for political leaders in Suriname. Molloch, a grizzled and passive, is an expert in methods of torture that works in numerous political regimes. In the first seven minutes, we attended Molloch using an electric current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As expected, the scene is horrible to watch and was removed from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who enjoys living in the Cayman Islands. The journalist approached Holland years before to rid humanity of Molloch, but rejected the offer. A Mexican professor named Héctor Lomelin (José Ferrer) makes a visit shortly after Hidalgo's death to convince the Netherlands to finish the job, bringing videotapes of testimonies from the victims of The Doctor's. At first, when she denied her denial, she finally accepts the dirty work, pointing to Molloch and her sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> The Netherlands enters Guatemala City with the help of a consultant, Max Ortiz (René). Enriquez); poses as a tourist with the widow of Hidalgo Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and her daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's later production, his character hits the Molloch henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a shoddy American diplomat (John Glover) and his supporting hit man (Roger Cudney) on the way. A brutal end takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where the doctor only receives deserts from several of his victims. <br /> <br /> 'The evil that men do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Colina and jumps into American political dealings in Latin America during the 1980s. In fact, 'Evil' is hard in every sense of the term, as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up enormous weaknesses in the development of plot and character. For each of the benefits that this film has, there are three or four fewer, as a result of forged craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> While 'The evil that men do' has a great concept, the film is never really more than an excuse for Bronson to eliminate foreign-based scum. In the style of the bad fiction of the pulp, 'Evil' is full of cardboard characters that we never know or understand. Holland, although Bronson played it hard, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a hitman. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland for much of the way, but later feels an affection for him. Where does his love come from, especially after seeing Holland kill several people and wanting to go home a few scenes before? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because many questions can be asked of them. Naturally, we never discovered what has brought them so close, how and where they started their torture treatment, what is the exact role of Claire in her business. These holes of the plot can last forever, especially with the paint plot by numbers that seems to do things as it goes. Why is Hidalgo's daughter in such a dangerous situation, apart from Molloch taking her hostage in a convenient way? If Molloch's bodyguard, Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the arena of cockfighting, why is he so friendly with them in a bar of backgrounds? Is your memory so short? And what was really the purpose, other than the cheap theater, of Holland throwing the driver of Molloch Cillero (Jorge Luke) out the window when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> The overall performance is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his best performances. The management of J. Lee Thompson lacks points, but may have been compromised for a limited time on the site. In addition to the filming of Evil in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear through better production values, cinematography and music. The rural places are very used to transmit the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America, and the filmmaker Xavier Cruz provides a rich color and clarity. Ken Thorne's orchestral score ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in an era of synthesized garbage. Oddly enough, these positive aspects only increase the frustration of a good movie that is screaming out. The Peter Lee Thompson edition is better than normal, although with more ridiculous continuity errors. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Than Men Do' was a perfect material for the 80s and I find it difficult to recommend it for 21st century amateur action. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a good presentation, which offers panoramic and standard format with subtitles in four languages. While the quality of the video is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in simple mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grinding sensation, with an eroded color and a diffuse sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
