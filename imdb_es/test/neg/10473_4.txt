I really do not know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least. What really bothered me, however, was the lack of development of the story between the characters. <br /> <br /> The 17-year-old Sheriff's daughter (Bruce Boxleitner) (Clara Bryant) has stayed with him during the summer and they do not spend 30 seconds together on the screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The sexy native American (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) apparently has a lot of interest in the Sheriff, but they do not spend time together either. <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two together. <br /> <br /> The bad developer against Native Americans is an overused story, but I personally like the evil developers who get theirs since I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with this was the creature. It was original. I have never seen anything like it and I am an imbecile for the new creatures.
