If this movie is a precise sample of the acting skills of J. Smits, I think he made a big mistake when he left television. Have not you seen a movie "starring" by David Caruso, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? As for acting ability, what about Mary-Louise? She has done much, much better. Yes, it is a terrible script, edited ineptly and without continuity, but expert actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. A big disappointment.
