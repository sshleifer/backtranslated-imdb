Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally relegated to B movies, they are even above this movie. It does not transmit even the slightest feeling of emotion, fear or fear, unless you have the fear of sitting in the rest of this garbage. The direction is amateur with annoying cuts and sudden movements that hide the fact that the killer is not close to the victims when he attacks. And what a killer it is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked it better when fighting against He-Man. This is one of the most lazy character design jobs I've seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And it's on a horse! Is this supposed to be a supernatural and terrifying creature? How are we supposed to take this seriously? All we get are the scenes of this guy riding through the forest on his horse, where he can barely keep up, interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly in the forest, thinking they can shoot a ghost. Occasionally, Skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or go through and stab someone, revealing how corny the effects really are. I usually enjoy the sci-fi channel rate on a basic level of cheese, but this movie is too inept for any level of fun. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need it?
