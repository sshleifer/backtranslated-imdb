You do not need balls to make fun of people who are late. Having to listen to Mencia insist that she is brave to make jokes of "delay" is intolerable. Also, you do not need balls to bite the chapel show. The series of racial games, the racial Olympics, it seems that many of the parodies are simply parodies of modified Chapelle Show, which are much less fun. <br /> <br /> But the most annoying thing about the show is his insistence that he's just marching to the rhythm of his own drum, when in reality he's marching to the beat of too many overworked drums. that have been touched many times <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that he presents himself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And not Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, then it goes on like this. But personally I think it's a bad show.
