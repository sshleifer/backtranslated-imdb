This movie has to be the biggest disappointment I've experienced with a movie. The performance is horrifying, the cumulative minimum accumulated, and the plot in general is ridiculous. I found myself encouraging the victim to simply hurry up and become a victim, because obviously she needed to be pulled out of her misery. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be displeased with the steps we are asked to do in logic, and the so-called accumulation of suspense would be fortunate for a 3-year-old child to be a little worried. I am dismayed that a sequel has been planned, because it means that they will ask us once again to bring a sub pair plot line. If this is an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I will avoid any and all future films.
