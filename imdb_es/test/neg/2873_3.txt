wow ... I just watched this movie ... Americans have this stereotyped vision of Hindi movies, as ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story ... It's pathetic how far from the truth it is. This film simply exposes the stereotypical Western vision of Hindi films. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. And all this for a Hollywood director. Most of India's movies today are much more content driven, realistic, poignant and meaningful than this piece of shit. Indian cinema (not only Hindi) also covers a variety of different themes. Like most other Hollywood movies these days, this shows a very stereotyped view of another country, where the truth is thrown out the window. This is a highly NOT recommended film. Instead of watching Hindi films like Black Friday, Eklavya, Omkara, Khakee, Awarapan, Gangster, Don, Zakhm, Dor, Sholay, Indian mother, Lagaan ... These films are what true Indian cinema is all about.
