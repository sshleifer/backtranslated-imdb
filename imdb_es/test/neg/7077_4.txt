CLASSIFICATION OF STARS: ***** Not to be missed **** Very good *** Good ** You could go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The story of Adam Holder (Mark O 'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily ramblings in their meaningless lives in search of the next solution that will make their day. Along the way, they try to reconcile with close relatives and friends whom they have managed to defraud and destroy over the years. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irish people like to drink, but it seems that some of them also have problems with heroin because of the look of this film. I know there is a small drug problem there, as it happens in many parts of the world, so another take of humor on the subject is not something totally unexpected. <br /> <br /> I do not know. I remember the last Irish movie I saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any movie I've seen lately!) And judging from that, obviously I'm not as enlightened with its humor as it could be. . The movie is quite funny in certain parts, but obviously it is another comedy that is not afraid to provoke laughter. The scene in which the child with a mental disability is assaulted in the back of an alley is certainly true of what a couple of drug addicts could do to feed their habit, but nevertheless it is completely despicable and I am not sure if it was understood as black humor. Either way, but he certainly did not put a smile on my face! It is also in stark contrast to their previous actions, where they are seen showing their soft side rocking a baby from one side to the other. In view of this, some may find the end sad, others may see it only as desserts. <br /> <br /> In general, I could not see the point of the movie. I did not see any motivation in the "story" I was telling. It just seems to wander without really involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!) For the most part, it's a failed effort that got me about to agree even though it's a very short 83 minutes. It really is not more fun than following two real-life drug addicts for a day. **
