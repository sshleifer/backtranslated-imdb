This film coincides with Mike Allred's comic book miniseries, "Red Rocket Seven," and tells the story of an alien who escaped to Earth to wait for "Astroesque" which is linked to the book of Revelations and the apocylpse. This is just part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read also "RR7"). It can easily be said that Allred is used to telling stories with images. The address is very good and the effects are not bad for a budget of $ 500. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and probably did not have the heart to say they could not act. Also, Mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie. Your spoon dialouge feeds the plot and does not let you enjoy the characters. This was really disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comics. 4 out of 10
