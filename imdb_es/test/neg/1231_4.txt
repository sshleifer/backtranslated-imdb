Okay, I forgot to look and I just got the last episode, thinking it was the first or the second. Honestly, I thought that CM would have at least one more quota to solve the plot points. The Rangers are left stranded on the plains ("We'll have to eat the horses"), on the one hand. Little Newt is stripped, on the other. What a sad ending! But my biggest complaint, esp. If this was the end, it is that the episode had no suspense, no great climax, no dramatic confrontations. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly organized. The whole episode had a terrible rhythm, which is what drives a Westerner. Steve Zahn was observable, Karl Urban (a bell for Johnny Knoxville) played Call as a man with a terminal block box. All the tight looks and the tinkling spurs and the protruding chin. And what about the Rangers? They talked big, about cleaning up Texas, then they swarmed aimlessly into the middle of the city, getting drunk. And how nice of Hal Holbrook to lend Val Kilmer his wig and Stache Mark Twain! The set of Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge of Blazing Saddles, every facade. I admit that I got involved in the plot, but that is mainly because there were many things that I did not understand, thanks to the fact that I arrived late in the story. If he had seen from the beginning, he might not have reached episode three. Now I have to go see Silverado to clean my palette.
