This film is recommended only for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them to sleep. Children of five years can also enjoy it. But for any other person (including fans of the genre), what a bore! The "old" plot is reminiscent of "Return Of The Dragon", and this movie is just as inept, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is an even worse movie. So far, this is the second movie (the offensive "comedy" "Bachelor Party" was the first) to which I gave 1/10.
