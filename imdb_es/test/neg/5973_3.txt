The title of this documentary is very deceiving. At no time during the documentary show how the introduction of the fish Nile Perch in Lake Victoria has caused none of the problems facing the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to locate Tanzania's problems in an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems come from an external parasitic force. The documentary is very slow, without any narration. Instead, it is based on small intervals of text between unrelated segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand the topic. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. One is a small segment of about 10 seconds in length where they interview the managers of the factory where the fish is processed and briefly mentions how 50 years ago it was introduced the perch of the Nile into the lake and consumed the other species of fish. The filmmaker makes no attempt to follow up on the subject or delve deeper into it. The second attempt is when, within this documentary, they film the presentation of another documentary that discusses the environmental impact introduced by Nile Perch, and again no real attempt is made to widen the devastation of the problem. <br /> <br /> The subject that this documentary deals with has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and much more with the problems that most African countries face. The film tries to link the introduction of perch with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person reads well with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been great if the filmmakers had shown what life or the local economy was like before the introduction of the fish and how it has been negatively affected by the introduction of the fish, but they do not. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interviewed say that the fish has given jobs and opportunities to many. Yes, things are BAD within the city of Mwanza, but they are much worse in other parts of the country and the continent. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentary makers to link fish to the problems of famine in Tanzania It is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First, Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many of the people interviewed say they can find a job and feed their families in Mwanza, the fishing village on the lake, because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and does not really attempt to link anything that is shown to the perch of the Nile. Play with the emotions of people by showing images of the devastation of poverty , famine and AIDS, without trying to show how all this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to perch. The fact is that most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than with the environmental effect of the Perch fish.
