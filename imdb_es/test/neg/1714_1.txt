This movie (even calling it a movie is an exaggeration) is ridiculously horrible. Normally, a big fan of Eric Roberts in the films of the "B" list, this tragedy of a movie makes me question his true influence on the B list! And Charlie, please, come back to expect a Murder Diagnosis revival instead of this ... you can not blame the nameless eyes (uhhum ... members of the beauty pageant) for participating in this weak movie, but YOU You are a former man, star of television! Take it easy. I do not even mean Stuart Pankin. For the sake of all that is good, Stuart, you should have seen that this was not necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to trick anyone into investing in this image (money or time). <br /> <br /> Actually, this was not a spoof or a fake movie, although it is a 2nd grade level. For the most part, writing and acting and camera work and editing are poor and ... well, everything is poor. I saw it because I read an article in some magazine about the participation of agent MJ and my interest was increased due to the demand in which I was involved. Now I wonder if the only reason why they show him from the shoulders in the film is because he, as in the trial, was presented with pajama pants and barely lucid (wait a second, are you ever considered really lucid? ... ramble). And agent MJ? Is that the best you can find for a name for your character? Sheez What a surprising piece of originality! Or, maybe that was supposed to be funny? Putting Marriott in the movie was a good touch at the beginning, but exaggerated and annoying after everything said and done. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of seeing ... do not say I did not do it I warned you
