HOW MANY FILMS CAN BE IN WHICH ANY OF THE CHANCES, A RAGTAG TEAM FACES THE BIG BOYS WITH ALL THE MONEY? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". In any case, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did you have to make these kinds of movies during the 90s and beyond? So, just avoid this movie. There are many good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this crap. Obviously, the "green" in their minds was money, because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some smart movies with Pixar.
