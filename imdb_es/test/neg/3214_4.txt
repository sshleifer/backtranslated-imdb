Nothing disgusts me more than a kung-fu movie that plays for laughter. It's the main reason why I can not stand Jackie Chan (or his like). He was not always a clown, I should add. "My young aunt" is one of the worst martial arts. It is a perfect example of how the subgenre was reduced to mud by innumerable foolish pranks and childish behavior. Unless you are 5 years old, I really do not understand how anyone could find this kind of movie funny. But humor is in fact a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this type of approach did permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I thought that the protagonist Kara Hui was very good here. But it cost me so much to go through this that I could not enjoy his excellent performance. If you do not care about stupidity, you can enjoy it. I know I did not.
