* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR IT MAY NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all their ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us THIS. Actually, the plot itself is nothing that we have not seen in movies like Snakes on A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc ... That means that a monster / animal / threat of some kind lurks in a nearby environment that It threatens a lot of people. In this case, an extraterrestrial in a train. Wow <br /> <br /> I must say that, when I saw this for the first time on the cable, I could not stop laughing. No SCIFI film had prepared me for this; It was so incredibly pathetic that I could not believe it! The actors are all a group of characters of stereotyped gender. But since they are not so famous (to say the least), I did not expect much from them. Except Phillips diamond. There are no comments there, but I think the boy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even by SCIFI Channel standards. That model / toy that made us believe that it was a real train (not to mention the toy model / helicopter, bigger than a train car), the meteor that comes HORIZONTALLY from space, the alien "baby" (a puppet of sock). 't kiddin'), the normal aliens that looked pretty ugly ... while they were static; when they started to "move", it was horrible, the explosions (the terrorist exploded LITERALLY! And what about the helicopter exploding! How many barrels of gas did that thing carry?), the insane mathematics used (they could not even solve a problem from school, right?) ... And I'm not going to talk about that end so apocalyptic, for that moment I did not know whether to keep laughing or start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It is an ideal movie to laugh, alone or with friends. But be careful; It's so ridiculous at MANY levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of disbelief ...
