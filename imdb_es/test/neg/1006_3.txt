I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box that would sell for $ 2 in a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character who returned from the success of the previous films and ruined everything with this load of garbage. Why the manufacturers wanted to destroy the reputation of the last 2 movies with this cheap junk? The story is so boring that it had to be a scandalous sequel. I mentioned to Cobra before because he has the same spirit, that a man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this film and Cobra were determined to show the hero firing his weapons at the level of the hip and the enemy falling in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range, why were they attacked by gang members who shot aimlessly from their hips? This movie was so bad that I thought for a minute it was Death Wish 4.
