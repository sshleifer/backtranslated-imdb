Motto: the lucky ones died ... before seeing this. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Bulgarian movie in 1920, so I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I almost do not remember it. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do not do anything right. His car has one in four wheels stuck in the sand, so they decide there is nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who knows the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts, but has never considered the idea of ​​informing the police about it. <br /> <br /> And, speaking of the police ... If those fanatics have lived around eating humans for years, many people must have disappeared ... why the sheriff did not suspect anything? <br /> <br /> But I stopped asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is boring. An incredible amazing hole. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and I will not talk about the dialogues. And the performance. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I'll just mention the final scene, where the abnormal girl removes a snake (snakes come out at the end, what the hell have to do with the story?) with a stone shot with sniper precision , demonstrating Mr. Craven's total indifference to reality and to the things that happen on planet Earth in general. <br /> <br /> I think there were riots when the movie was first released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even being eaten by a cannibal would not be a fair punishment for the director for this attack on the intelligence.
