First, a warning. 'How to marry a millionaire' is preceded by a seemingly random five-minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene', a piece by Gershwin-lite treated with all the pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting through it requires some patience. If you have the DVD, be assured that you can jump forward. You will not lose anything. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of the 50s in Hollywood, a film so reinforced by the great power of the stars, the opulent staging and the perfect concept that The failure It seems inconceivable. The title is just perfect. Generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves: how is this so weak? The script is an albatross on the neck of the production, a thing with smell and death that drowns everyone and everyone before they can really come alive. There are no funny situations, only isolated moments that play to laugh. Every time a real comedy scene threatens to develop, the film quickly moves to other less interesting things. An example: the scene in which each of the three main ladies takes an appointment to the same luxury restaurant. One of them, myopic, refuses to use his glasses for vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood setting, surely, complete with a wrong identity, an angry wife and probably a cake on the face for someone? Well, no. Instead, we cut between the three dates, since the ladies react "comically" to the things that their partners say. Hit the punchline, and cut to the next joke of lameness. If in doubt, have Marilyn enter a wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood goddess. This was one of the outstanding films of Marilyn Monroe, and the camera simply eats it, even though the script does not give her anything to do. She is so luminescent that she almost seems newborn. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been a big star for almost a decade, and knows how to dominate the screen even when she's in the box with Monroe. She gets the only thing that goes through a real role, and she offers some good lines with a cynical touch: given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She is a curiously ageless actress, when she lies about her age in the film and says she is forty, not ridiculous at the moment, and is much less feminine than her co-stars, which gives her convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from eternal, and had eight good years in her co-stars, which brought her closer to the end of her career in Hollywood. Sometimes there is an air of despair about her, stranded on the screen with nothing more than a toothpaste smile and some comic snippets, unable to interpret her true age but without deceiving anyone as a contemporary of this new and sharper generation of actresses. to trust the same old trick that had served him throughout his career (for those who doubt Marilyn, seeing the two juxtaposed in this film helps to highlight the subtlety of Monroe and, yes, intelligence). It is also concentrated on dead wood in terms of co-stars (although all men, including the great William Powell, are guilty of lazy performances); She can not shoot any funny spark from them. It is better to have given his role to the wasted Monroe, which could be fun by itself, and have left Grable with Mr. Magoo's repetitive routine. <br /> <br /> Make the movie as pleasant as possible. let yourself be seduced by the exquisite Hollywood production, the kind that makes even the two "like" of "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" can be seen. But somewhere, buried under the jokes and professionalism, is the outline of a sharp and cynical comedy about the business of marriage that Bacall could have made sing, and new generations of viewers will sit with "How to marry a millionaire " waiting for that movie, ready to be disappointed again.
