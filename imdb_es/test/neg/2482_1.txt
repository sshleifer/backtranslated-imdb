Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that people dig this garbage. Most television shows are pretty bad, and this has been a constant trend for a while: they keep getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely takes it home. What a terrible show ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a group of C + losers who never went anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking when he joined this position) so it's not your fault that this show stinks. They just can not help it. Blame the producers and writers. I can not believe that they filmed this and that they were proud enough of their work to transmit it.
