I classify this as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If there ever was a movie I wanted about my enemies, it would be this one. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters only tense the belief. <br /> <br /> These factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother left the movie around 15 minutes. I realized that a film so boring and slow * must * have an interesting twist to the plot, and I was quite disappointed when nothing interesting materialized. I briefly considered sending a bill to the filmmakers for my 2 hours of lost life.
