I've been watching many Asian horror movies lately, but this has to be the worst yet. It started quite interesting, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The "dramatic" scenes added, the flashback sequences and the serious holes in the plot left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Only "something terrible" ??? Who started all the murders if it was not the ghost? What did she want to come back to her ????? There are no answers at all! In general, they do not give much fear and the creators of films must contribute much better ideas than this one ... <br /> <br /> A positive aspect was the pretty actress, but that's all. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
