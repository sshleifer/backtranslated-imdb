Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating because of the real, or at least viable, elements of the story. It is a racing driver (Steve Alaimo) who gets confused with a group of motorcyclists called the angels of Satan, who meet a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also recruited by the police to inform them what the Angels are doing and where they will steal next. It is not even that the film is really "dated", although, of course, it carries the significantly raw and stupid music of the film (from the band on stage in one scene, to the "interpretation" of Alaimo, if you can call it to that drek, to the regular generic score). <br /> <br /> It's just that the filmmaker does not care more about putting a little more logic, direction and better actors for the parties. As it is, I did not have a great dislike for the movie, as I did with the Hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to all that, too. What could become unpredictable only comes with stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ('Citrusville' ho-ho). So it's not completely worthy of your state of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in recent times. The comment is good in the film, although once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters said on screen in case it's worth it. The Wild Rebels could be more of a good time if you have a pack of six and low expectations, but as it is, I would not see it again.
