I live in Mexico City, so I have to suffer the trailers for every garbage that comes out of all these stupid Mexican filmmakers. Do you want to admire a Mexican guy for making great movies? Take a look at something from Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I do not like his films, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible and most terrible garbage in history (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in the world. Mexican movies. If you respect your brain, avoid this piece of shit at all costs. It would be smarter to watch a video of a wedding or watch Britney's reality show. That has more IQ than everyone in this "movie."
