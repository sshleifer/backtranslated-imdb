This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored that we moved quickly through the last half of the movie just to see what happened. It is typical of sports, or win or lose. The only thing that was remotely interesting was when the boy referred to someone as a Veg-e-tab-le. That will be a phrase that my friend and I bring for many years reminding us of this colossal clich√© of the loss of time.
