This is, in fact, one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless and confusing mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and budget) of its predecessors ("Death On The Nile", "Evil Under the Sun ") and Donald. Sutherland is a pale shade of Peter Ustinov in regard to the screen detectives (of course, he is playing a much less interesting character than Poirot). The film manages to get as far as it does only with the plot of Christie's (all its plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
