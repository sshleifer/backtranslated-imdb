The perfect double bill for the horribly corny "Beverly Hillbillies" is this "comedy", "Son in Law", equally atrocious and unintelligent. Rebecca, a country girl, goes to wild California to attend college, only to be assaulted by lifestyle. "Tracker" of the "Resident Advisor" helps her settle in, and soon they are both good friends. Bec decides to take the "Trace" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious "fish out of water" results. <br /> <br /> The only other comic angle that Steve Rash (with an appropriate name) achieves here is a sexual one. This makes us drunk, but in vain. Both comic aspects fail terribly, and you know that the movie is groping when "Crawl" hijacks the combine and writes its name in the cornfield. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the film falls short too, with several family attempts. and personal "Crawl" advice failing. Among them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast is mere fodder. The problem is that, in reality, it's almost impossible for you to like "Track", and you'll find yourself going through the whole movie wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him. However, if you're a fan of unintelligent comedy, "Son in Law" is right. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
