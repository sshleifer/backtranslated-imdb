Not even the kitchen of Emeril Lagasse can save this silly and disconnected nonsense, starring emeril lagasse as a TV chef of the food channel, who with the help of the team to try to improve the show, the poor plot and the stupid script throw This program to the Drain, Robert Urich lost in the bad role of support and, unfortunately, this was the last in its history (RIP), <br /> <br /> This is the worst show of 2001 and will be on the list of the worst shows of this Decade. <br /> <br /> I feel very sorry for Emeril Lagasse for making this comedy, he even said to himself as something stinky. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that they are the same producers of women who design. who made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
