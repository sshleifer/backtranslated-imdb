I have seen this movie but not in a single session. What happens is that he is playing on television, I watch for a few minutes, I discover that I have everything I can take and I leave the room. During those few minutes I do not laugh a single time, I do not feel pleasure in what I'm seeing and I feel more depressed than angry. Interestingly, they tell me that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one can not be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie puts that theory to the test. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, so as I watch the scenes, I think about my own experiences in that rotten city and, therefore, I'm clearly bringing a lot of my luggage to the room. It is entirely possible, I am willing to admit, that if you are not a citizen of Chicago, you will find the piece fun. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And still. John Hughes put his movies in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first class writer. I think it's obvious that he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters sympathetic and credible. In a comedy (as opposed to a farce) this balance is vital. And it is not easy to achieve. If everyone was doing great movies and we would not have to worry about how we do in the real world asking us when the genie will appear. In "Adventures in the care of children", it is not like that. I hated those characters. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a drunk. There is no humor, there is no humanity, there are no people that one can recognize. Only actors who read their lines as if they could do everything possible to avoid screaming at them, sure that hilarity will finally occur, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually the moment I get up and leave, I start to feel sorry for everyone involved, which is a kind of emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She does not act, she certainly does not act comically, and it is very possible that she can not. But sir as she tries. He looks older than 17, and acts much younger as a seven-year-old boy who makes an effort in a play, sure that's how you get a prize. And she is not alone. It is as if everyone could not relax and let the story flow. As if everyone simply did not have an idea of ​​what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Now, this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and it would clearly improve and have better writers (for example, John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so maybe a bit of forgiveness is necessary. But the movie simply stinks of despair. However, as I said, it may work for some. If any of the previous points attracts you, and clearly some of the reviewers did, then get the DVD and ask for it. Otherwise, avoid this mess as you would with a dark Chicago alley where, as you hurry, you can only see shadows and hear murmured threats.
