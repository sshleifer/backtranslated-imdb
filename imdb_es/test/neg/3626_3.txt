Well folks, I agree with the reviews of almost everyone else here. The characters. Are. Stupid. ALL are stereotyped, and yet they have beautiful clothes and they are always thin. <br /> <br /> I do not even mean the role of Jamie Lynn as ZOEY. Zoey is a pretty, popular, tanned, blonde young teenager that everyone LOVES! She has a "rebellious" personality, great, with which everyone agrees, no matter how silly or extreme. The most annoying of all: his voice is so bubbly and unpleasant. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the first episode. By the time she enters the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to love her. The boys want to invite her out, the girls want to be her friends, etc. Thinking that it's all that, the episode unfolds and Zoey is always the center of attention; She is the best player in the unofficial women's basketball team, confident, and she has everyone in her pity when they hit her weakly in the face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character by far is that this whole series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something like that, who is the ONLY person who has appeared on the show to hate Zoey . <br /> <br /> And Zoey does not even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. In one of the episodes, she even calls her friend madness without ever apologizing and showing no regrets in doing so. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> -Design Professional t-shirts and backpacks (which become a great success) <br /> <br /> -pproach with outlines VERY elaborated BY ITSELF to teach a lesson to only one person. <br /> <br /> - Illegal grades <br /> <br /> - Assuming guilt for things that were not even related to her so that everyone else could be happy. <br /> <br /> - Reach a commercial that was so good that it was put on television. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. She has no talent to act. She is always the perfect person. She acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! I can not stand it <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone in the show always has great clothes. Even the nerd! His wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty damn decent. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone at PCA loves you, Zoey, and they would do anything for you, even if it meant giving your right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. The humor is usually kind and funny, but the characters are so flat that it's hard to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder spends a little more time thinking about the guy. of the characters I wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that they are stupid and stupid. <br /> <br /> Point: Nobody is a bit overweight, everyone has elegant clothes, Zoey is the definition of Mary-sue, The story lines are well thought out, and the humor is laughable. But once again, I want to emphasize that the characters stain the show. Look at the program if necessary, but do not say I did not warn you if your eyes start to bleed.
