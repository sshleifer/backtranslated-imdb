During the 1990s, several attempts have been made to revive the Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old saga of Yamato in the form of a ridiculously bad "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after only two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and useless "Harlock saga," while the Galaxy Express 999 suffered the trick of a movie stapled in his name. <br /> <br /> If you have seen "Queen Millennia", you will remember that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this chapter already concluded, and also finds a way to stink. <br /> <br /> This movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, mixing it with the bad The fast-paced melodrama, and to add an insult to an injury, throws some of the most famous characters of the Matsumoto universe. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this film is good artistic work, but the rest is incredibly bad. that he can not prevent this movie from being a total loss. <br /> <br /> If you have enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this trick of a movie. Thank you
