This revision contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, 'D.O.A.' at least it begins as if it were an ingenious and entertaining nonsense like Fincher's 'Game'. Its central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that seem to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot vibrates at too great a speed, which leads to a dramatic turn that does not reach half, when the character learns that he has been poisoned and only has 1 or 2 days of life. And this, simply, is too big a turn to add casually to a story. Once this has happened, the only chance of success of the film is whether it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as their principal, in fact, it is their only subject: but 'D.O.A.' continue as if this is just a normal revelation like any other you can find in a thriller. The problem is twofold: first, Quaid's actions are not convincing, since it is likely that someone's situation is his; and secondly, even if they convinced him, it is difficult to worry about what will happen when the most important point of the plot has already been resolved prematurely. The rest of the film is pretty standard for a movie of this type, but it becomes more tedious than usual due to the difficult situation of the character, which logically dwarfs the events in which the film is interested. Dennis Quaid, in the lead role, does not do it. Do not convince, either as an exhausted teacher or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is often ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly soundtrack of the 80s. Instead, see 'The Game', which of similar roots is still tense and driven by the character, while 'D.O.A.' It is derived in developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise itself is quite intriguing, it is a pity to see it drowned in a surplus of overcooked plot.
