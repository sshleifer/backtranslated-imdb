As for the Asian horror, I've seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest imaginable ... "Acacia" does not really qualify for any of those categories. He had a few moments of tension and it was interesting to see, but I could not help thinking that there should have been a little more in this story. The film is about a couple without children who decide to adopt a child who seems to have a fascination for trees. He develops a link with the Acacia tree in his yard and seems to communicate with it. Then, during a fight with his mother that involves his new biological son, he goes furious after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree. When she does not return, the parents send a report and wait, while the neighbor believes that she somehow lives in the Acacia tree. The pace is quite slow and the end becomes a bit strange, but I have to recommend this as a bit of a nice effort, although the story feels a bit flat. Hell, I really can not decide on this ...
