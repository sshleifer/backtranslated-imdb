What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, consisting of evil, hateful, spoiled children and parents who are determined to be great, instead of being parents? I'm sorry I do not understand it. The only episode that I could barely look at the stomach involved one of the children who demanded a Bar Mitzvah, with the intention of obtaining thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious little boy has to have the biggest and test party, and he has no problem losing 20 of the big ones in the big event. The adolescent daughter, crazy, brain dead, crazy, goes from one side to another between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic, when she sees the "cute" religious tutors. <br /> <br /> The only "moving" limiting moment in the whole episode was when the father of a father, who has been convinced all along that Bar Mitzvah is only a plan to make money, the son See studies his Hebrew lessons and is momentarily deceived into thinking that maybe, his intriguing offspring is Being sincere about the right of passage to manhood. This warm and confused feeling is immediately ripped from his chest when he informs Junior that, since he has not yet had a bris, a certain "procedure" must be performed. Bar Mitzvah is canceled, and the mother leaves several thousand dollars when the child refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is trash, and it saddens me that I will never return in the 23 minutes of my life I wasted seeing this shit, because there was nothing else on television ...
