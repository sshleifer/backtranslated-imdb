"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of the not so well-known first American Hitchcock films. But if "Lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, not all the films signed by the master of suspense at that time (early 40's) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, do not discover that this movie is not really a loss. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a normal and conventional comedy, where it is quite difficult to find Hitchcock's touch. Maybe you can glimpse his shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is capable of at some point (but it's well hidden in an impersonal package), in a scene of vertigo where two of the characters are trapped in the upper part. Of a fair attraction, and perhaps in the character of the mother. And that's it! Even for the Hitchcock fan, there's little to relate to. <br /> <br /> And for the fans of mindless comedies, there's not much else: none of the situations is exaggerated enough to be really funny, and we're far from the masterpieces of Hawks, for example. And if one or two scenes are quite funny, there are not even the most amusing ones in Hitchcock's filmography, which created comical situations in almost all his films (even "Psycho" could be considered full of very dark humor). Therefore, there is very little to save in this movie, which can, without disturbing anyone (or maybe just the Hitchcock and Screwball comedy fans, who are in love with Carole Lombard), is still one of the most so known at the beginning of American Hitchcock. movie.
