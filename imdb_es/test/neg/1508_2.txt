The grandmother, led by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho killer dressed in an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts his party. <br /> <br /> They say you can not judge a book by its cover, but it seems that the same does not apply to DVDs: last night I wanted a horror movie REALLY bad, and from the cover of Granny was shown an image of the titular killer swung an ax, a terrible typography (they even use the source of the Sand system, a definitive design, no-no!), and the credits that have absolutely nothing of what I have heard I think it would be pretty lousy <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a movie lasts just under an hour, you really should not waste a lot of time before you get to the action; The grandmother, however, spends the first 20 minutes more or less with her unpleasant group of friends who indulge in meaningless games and extremely banal conversations. Anyone who really stays with the film long enough for the murder to start (and I doubt most healthy people will get upset) will be the victims of several terrible death scenes with amateur gore, a lot of horrible acting and a surprising ending that does not surprise (If you have seen April Fool's Day, then you will guess what the turn is before revealing it). <br /> <br /> The grandmother has no inspiration, is uninteresting and can hardly be seen. Avoid.
