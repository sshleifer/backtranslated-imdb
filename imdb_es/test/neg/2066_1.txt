I do not even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> it's not worth writing a review, so I'll just quote what another user posted because I completely agree, but I give it 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I can not find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was, the initial precept was promising, but in all respects it was totally horrible afterwards, let's review the main points Plot - good initial idea, but really terrible development There were many points when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid."

It's the worst movie I've seen in movies for years, if not ever. "
