Synopsis: Children are not accepted in any university. He creates a "university" where he and his friends can party using their parents' tuition money. <br /> <br /> Wow. A Paean to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think we're all right, man, then this movie is for you. In addition, you must understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything inside, they just have to let it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity with which everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony, as long as you eliminate those restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. The extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a "charter school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it is because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of the low functioning students who will end up working on fast food anyway). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the genre of college comedy, that is, Animal House. Follow the pattern quite closely. What is new here, however, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. The knowledgeable sympathizer is missing, a teacher who embodies the valuable part of university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will condemn this movie to the later ranks of Blockbuster. On the one hand, I wondered if it would be an ironic version of self-reference of the whole genre, for about a minute. The film does not have a deep meaning, nor layers, nor introspection. It's as if they let some children who never went to class do what is natural. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say this: go see something with Will Farrell instead.) His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
