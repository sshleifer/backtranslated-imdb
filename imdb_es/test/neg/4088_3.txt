Although I am not too religious, I still have relatively high hopes for this film, since it has the incredible Steve Carrell, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and intelligent comedy with a Christian theme. However, Evan Almighty does not approach this originality and freshness that the original has, and can not decide if it is a comedy or a sentimental film about faith and family values. If I had chosen a clear path on which of these subjects to focus on, I could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, a cheesy dialogue and The reasons that try to give depth to the film, but instead practically insult the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and cloudy presentation of the opaque message of the film. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very badly written, there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that do not make any sense. For example, although a wide variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to Evan while building the ark to save itself from the flood, its inclusion is really necessary when the only "flood" that occurs in the film is downtown Washington DC? And a suburban neighborhood, which means they run no risk of being destroyed? It seems that the filmmakers lacked the originality to modernize the biblical story, and instead, took place in a present moment without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that simply do not add up like this and make it evident. The idiotic and written motives inside the movie. In general, this work is tragic in the sense that the interim talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes is not exhibited due to the soft characters they represent, and that it was so poorly written that it distorts and encodes many of the film's attempts, and makes A mockery of the first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors in him and to any half-intelligent viewer, since he fails both of them miserably.
