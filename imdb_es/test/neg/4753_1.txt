This entry does not contain a spoiler. You do not have to do it. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the early films of Alien was the suspense that something could happen. This was true in the first two Predator films, although less frequent. Requiem has completely eliminated the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and blood. You know that people are going to die (well, duh, it's an AvsP movie), but you know WHO is going to die and WHEN they will die, and WHERE they will die before it happens. The directors should learn a lesson from Hitchcock that said: "The suspense is not a time bomb that shoots under a table, the suspense is a bomb that does NOT shoot under the table." What's the point of going to the movies when you know exactly what's going to happen and when? If you really want to see this movie, wait for it to appear in the video and then RENT, but I will never buy it.
