I can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those in which the subtitles are weak and really do not seem to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that really did not make sense. br /> <br /> In general, I can admit some terrifying and strange parts, but they are repetitive, I felt I was watching a trailer; It seems like it was a short movie with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, but it does not even close the hype ... the excessive length ended with emotion. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of these types of movies (as I thought it was), do not waste your time on this one.
