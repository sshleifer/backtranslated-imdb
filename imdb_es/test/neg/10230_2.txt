I loved the first movie, the second was good, disappointed John Cleese was no longer jean bob as his favorite character. But the third ... What happened to the animation? It seems low budget as a morning caricature. except for the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad! Derek's voice has changed but it is not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also do not understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he was dead! This movie made me want to turn it off, as much as I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this delivery. They will never defeat the original! :)
