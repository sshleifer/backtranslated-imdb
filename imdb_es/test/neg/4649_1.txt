The legendary Cameron Mitchell talks about an actor / makeup artist who burns with the head of a studio when they throw a drink to his face while lighting a cigarette. Reduced to a mess with scars and with an eye patch, Mitchell works in Movieland's Wax Museum. It also kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so that they can turn them into exhibitions. Truly weird bad movie that defies description. Observe how the various wax figures try not to move, observe how all the tobacco consumed in various southern states is consumed, observe how things become increasingly rare. It's a terrible train wreck of a movie and you can not take your eyes off the screen. A bad classic movie that will surprise you even when it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
