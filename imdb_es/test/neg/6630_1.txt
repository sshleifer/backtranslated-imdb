Should I have expected something more than putrid from Carrot Top? This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It is by far the worst comedy I have seen in my life. The "Chairman of the Board" did not add humor to my attitude, but it infuriated me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I got angry that this man is making movies.
