Oh, the sex life of the potato men, what evil demon created you? This is a movie you see, smile a little during the execution time and then, when you mention it to other people who have seen it, you can not help but smile as you speak. But it's not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is really a funny movie and that it inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, it's just that the movie is so strange; he is so insulting and is not shameless in his attempt to achieve a docile laugh to do with sex and sexual life in general that he can not help but make his mouth break into a smile. Keep in mind that what follows the smile is a sinking of the head; a shake of the head and an increase of the index finger and the thumb in both eyebrows while rubbing them gently in an attempt to remember your time seeing this garbage. <br /> <br /> But that's the movie, it's garbage It's a very brave and shameless garbage, but garbage is nothing. Whoever had this idea, put it on paper and then spread it throughout the industry trying to do it must be very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a film that is, without doubt, "about" something, but that does not have, under any circumstance, a decisive narrative. This follows from the idea that most of European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open and issues take precedence over most other things. In Sexual Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and, technically, the same joke are repeated again and again and that is an idea that is that "sex is a very, very funny thing". These ideas are perhaps best suited for an American movie, so it's no wonder that after a while watching this movie, things start to feel a little out of place. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends in the same way, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular trip that has not gone anywhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. Three guys sit around a table talking and what not. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to the stories, situations or scenarios, raw and disgusting that everyone can imagine. The strange thing here is that every time a man says something unpleasant, the other makes a face but has an equally dirty story to give in return, creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what does not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people accompanied by Tolly (Coleman) every time the film thinks it's good to throw a third face to decipher some nasty sexual jokes or break some peculiar stories. They are employees of Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but problems in which the film is more interested in exploiting humor instead of studying. <br /> <br /> So, what is the situation in Sexual Lives of Potato Men? The three or four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall when we witness the dirty play that these people commit over the course of about a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, for Jeremy things are simply creepy. Everything starts quite innocently and there seems to be a woman who likes and likes him in return, but when the essence of Jeremy is simply a stalker crawls, that's when the jaws fall. Jeremy's character is used and expressed in a way that makes unrequited love and harassment in general look "fun." Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing some kind of psychotic person more associated with Hannibal Lecter who writes his letters to Clarice in Hannibal in 2001. But any sympathy we may have by him at this point it becomes absolutely false when, later on, the true origin of their relationship is revealed. Suddenly, as a public we feel cheated to feel a little sorry for him before and for some reason he did what he did, in the first place, he seems cowardly and nasty. Say what it was that would ruin the few surprises that are hidden inside the movie. <br /> <br /> Pretty sad how, in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about something or other that exclaims that he does not have "artistic vision, just a big mess". I hate when the words spoken by the characters echo the film they are in. Sex Lives of the Potato Men does not explore the psyche of a person or the particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to walk having the greatest possible sex. it simply uses them as a front to accumulate jokes and situations ridiculously without grace. Instead of taking group sex and exploring what drives a person to look for it, it makes it a silly joke (tickets with numbers?); Instead of entering into the mindset of a sadomasochistic fanatic, the movie has someone hanging on the ceiling of a basement and warns everyone about "the salt and vinegar starters" when it climaxes. Ferris covers his face with disgust and the camera goes to the next scene without too much scandal. It is a relief that the film reached no audience abroad. This is a section of British culture, in fact, of the British mentality that I pray will be limited to our shores and ignored accordingly.
