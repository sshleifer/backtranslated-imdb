The film shows the relationships of the dying mother and the son, who is very attached to her and definitely loves her. Shows? It shows that they live in very bad conditions. It shows how tenderly they "walk" (actually he is bringing it). But what do we see further? After his walk, he walks alone in the same places, where they walked together. It's not possible. A person who loves and cares for another dying person, would do everything possible to improve his life. He would not have a free minute to meditate, to be alone with himself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he normally has to be. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he learned many visual effects from Tarkovsky. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any sense or state of mind. Someone has compared this movie with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing in common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great movie and this is just a bad imitation.
