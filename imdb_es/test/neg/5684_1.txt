I watched the first 10 minutes and got bored to death. Therefore, I help all the way to the end. This movie must be the worst of all in the category of low budget science fiction movies so far. Bad performance, cast, directions, personalized imitation of Lara Craft, history, plot, everything! Throughout the whole movie, I think maybe there are only 6 to 7 people in the whole cast, but ONLY two of them started in the whole movie. I expected something like the Starship Trooper, but it was nothing like that. I was fooled by the title of the film and the image on the cover of the DVD. Do not waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Now that I think about it, I wonder why they bothered to make bad movies like this one.
