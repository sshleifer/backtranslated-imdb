Big disappointment CLASH BY NIGHT is very interesting and theatrical, and the dialogue does not resonate as true coming from these characters. This is melodrama in its heyday. The acting is truly exaggerated and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as support players give this movie any zip. I wish they had more to do. I'm someone who looks at details in the movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who is taking care of the baby all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas is working, then he is fighting in a bar with his father? 2. When Stanwyck is packing to leave the city, why do they see her in the place of her brothers where she has not lived for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the theater screening room, who is taking care of the baby again? Such details really irritate me and make me give much lower ratings to movies. What were the writers, directors and all the others related to the thought of the film? Nuf 'said.
