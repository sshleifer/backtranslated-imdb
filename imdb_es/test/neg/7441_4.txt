Next, the promoted update is triggered through the head. Rather, considering the sorry state of this film, a sequel to a film that evidently did not need it. <br /> <br /> What really irritates Robocop 2 is that the creators obviously did not understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was an ingenious and vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Thin by the dialogue, particularly towards the tedious ending and shooting, attracts little interest and does not possess any of the energy or spirit of the original. The fake advertisements, now a little bland ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") seem to simply be there as a last-minute idea. And calling a new drug designer "Nuke" is not as subtle or as fun as the original family board game, "Nuke ?? em!" <br /> <br /> The stop-motion animation? The weakest element of the original? is used more extensively, while this sequel without humor does not include a sequence of credits, which makes it seem even cheaper and hurried. Oh, no humor? You could say. But what about the funny mayor, or the way Robo is reprogrammed to pour them? Yes, these are attempts to alleviate the light, like Robbery hardening with a screwdriver ("we are only human") for the auction of the film, but it is likely that none of them provoke laughter. Like the rest of the movie, they are serious and bizarre entertainment attempts. <br /> <br /> The third and final film of the series (imaginatively titled Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in an undemanding role. With attenuated language and violence, it was an obvious appeal to the children's market, a very connected Robo action figure. With too much social awareness, and Robocop's new arm accessories and jetpack are becoming too stupid, the final film was never meant to be a masterpiece. However, the fluid direction of Fred Dekker and a fluid rhythm make this a pleasant and disposable vision. <br /> <br /> Robocop, then, is the movie itself. Robocop 3 is the sequel you can see if there is nothing better. What leaves the second movie hanging in the middle, a twinge of an image that can not be seen. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, except for the pound signs that sounded. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, just as comic book artist Frank Miller and his partner Walon Green are not the writers that Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good concept, although limited. 4/10.
