I had high expectations around this movie (not like it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on the cable, they were all shattered. Starting with the performance (poor, almost mediocre, a surprising waste of good actors and talents) and the story itself: since when did a squad of 5 men go out to patrol in a supposed "hot" zone? To suicide? It's a big mistake, which costs the movie very expensive. Very good actors act really bad here, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated the annoying way of talking about "I am Sam", and Michael J. Fox, who wasted a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen on "Platoon", acting simply "average". But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid waste of talent on the part of the director), who was a corny person, scared and insecure, even more irritating than Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard him). The battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet in a VC tunnel. De Palma has a weak job here, and if it were not for films like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables" (these excellent films), I would consider him a "bluff" director: too much publicity, bad filming. <br /> <br /> 3/10
