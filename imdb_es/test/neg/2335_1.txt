seriously, if he wanted to make a movie that does not make sense, he never will, and that includes lesbian scenes as his only highlight, he could have done it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst, as is this movie. . Anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow or so long. The story does not mean anything without something in the end besides the credits. What a waste of time. I will never recover those 147 minutes of my life and I hope others can learn from my mistake.
