I admit that I see many really bad movies. But there are very few in which I can think that they are as bad as When women had tails. He is a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is, instead, a boring, lifeless affair without a single laugh. The comedy is extremely weak. I guess if you think hitting someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like great art. And there simply is not enough plot to keep the thing together. It seems to lengthen again and again. <br /> <br /> Well, you may be wondering: "If it's as bad as it says, why did not you rate it below 3/10? Good question! And I have two answers. The film is not without its curiosity value I find a bit of interest in an Italian parody of films like One Million Years BC With Raquel Welch, I'll give When Women Had Tails a point for its historical "value" The other two points They are by the mere presence of Senta Berger, I know it is not an explanation or reasoning for a qualification, but what are you going to do? It's the best thing that comes to mind.
