And now for another point of view: I did not like it. In fact I did not finish it. I know that "Unforgiven" is classified by some as one of the best westerns ever created. I know that it stars and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know he won a lot of Oscars. Still, I did not like it. I do not like westerns, and that's clearly a matter of taste, but I also do not admire Eastwood's performance. He is not and has never been an important man. It's not Burt Lancaster, not Paul Newman, not John Wayne. Only in this film is he dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with an uncomfortable voice who usually plays tough guys. Here plays a retired tough guy. When I see it on the screen, I see a man working on his performance. Then there is the Western anti-Western plot. Obviously, it is meant to inject contemporary values: respect for the role of women, blacks, Native Americans and single mothers; a lack of respect for violence and drinking; the fullness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage and adorable little children, in a century when those values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in this way. By promoting these values, the film is presented as moderated, if not preached. Then there are the old movie stereotypes: prostitutes with hearts of gold, the boy who can not shoot directly, the newest city in the wild west, the brush of salvia shining on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in the main chords. Finally there is the pace of Eastwood's address. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still traveling north, talking to Morgan Freeman and the boy who could not shoot directly, sixty minutes after the plan launched by a prostitute's attack was launched. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements unconvincing. I'm afraid it was me.
