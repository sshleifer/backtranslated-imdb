It sounded very promising in the rental store, the premise sounded great and I could not wait to get home and see it. It was terrible that the diographer is terrible, the action is extremely poorly written and the plot plummets from the beginning. Gutenberg presents a pathetic performance, Sean Bean does everything he can, but with a script so bad that he could not do much. <br /> <br /> This is not worth even to see, even if you can get it for free (borrow it). of a friend, for example) Do not regret it and waste 90 Minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
