Actually, Son of the Mask made me laugh several times ... mainly because of the cartoon jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this film. Garfield, for example, is not on par with CGI, but would give the same vote. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which was not so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a movie for children ... and, therefore, should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. Their attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and acting in general is bad. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, my 2 and 5 year old children saw the All of this without complaining. At least I could sit through this. <br /> <br /> There's no way this movie is worse than ** shuddering ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for the CGI and some laughs
