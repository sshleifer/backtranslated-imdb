'R Xmas is one of the only movies I've seen where I can almost say that nothing just happens. I felt as if I saw a middle class couple with drug dealers, with a child, walking, eating, smoking, talking (excuse me, I swear) through most of the movie. And I do not think I'm missing the point. I think this film was well directed, it acted well (although the husband's performance was quite hard) and the constant feeling of imminent death Certainly, in every corner he kept the viewer involved. But when the dust clears, its left with zero (just a boat full of fading). I did not want car chases, violence with guns, beatings, etc. I'm sick of the violence. But my God, at least let's dig a little deeper into all these characters (let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better, not just show them pictures of them as street thugs). Why was the dialogue? so young? They all spoke as if they were in high school. I think that even this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _, sh_ _, etc. The rhythm and the story of 'R Xmas seemed quite interesting to me, but the execution was plain and simple-empty.4 / 10
