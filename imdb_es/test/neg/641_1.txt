"Eh-heh heh heh hey, look at these aliens, they're like - bite humans and stuff! Eh-heh eh heh-heh" <br /> <br /> This must be among the worst movies of all times. It is completely absurd for anyone with a minimum of brain. Sure, you have the payroll reviewers who issue enthusiastic comments and vote in favor of this abomination, but it's easy to know who these sales are. Your comments are too good. To give a movie like this, even a mediocre review that claims to have some remediation remedy for film B would be a brilliant review! Calling this a great movie gives the hands of corporate accomplices. <br /> <br /> But enough. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the negative characteristics that a movie can have without being SO bad. It's nice to just laugh. The old movies of Japanese monsters of the 60s had a quality that this film lacked. At least in those 60s movies, you can laugh at how badly the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh when you see the ropes that hold the spacecraft, how the models hung on the ropes and how the flames curved UP from the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (also known as Dead Rail) seems really to be considered a GOOD movie, which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects were terrible by today's standards. More than horrible. However, it is not as bad as the monster movies of the 60s, so they lacked comedic appeal. The plot and the dialogue were as sophisticated as I've seen, made worse by being as predictable as might be expected. I will not even point out the plot and the logical holes in it; it just would not be fair to this regrettable plot (plus it would take a long time even to start). Most of the acting was horrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to play this one. <br /> <br /> SciFi Channel is quickly becoming the "cheap emotion channel", producing film after film without a hint of concept or intelligence in the lot. I can only ask myself: why bother? <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this gut. It can not be worst.
