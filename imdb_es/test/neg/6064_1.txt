The original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Read ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmmakers who have ever done grace on the screen. This remake is abominable. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing of value here and it is a pity that this product bears the same title as the original brilliant one. Only the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. I'm surprised Rod Steiger has participated. This may be the only bad movie I ever made. Maybe he needed the paycheck.
