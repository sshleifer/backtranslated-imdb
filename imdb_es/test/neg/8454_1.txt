I caught this during a brief career in a Philadelphia theater. In spite of its local origin (and its relation with a local tragedy, specifically the death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to criticize this film. The director, for more known reasons of himself, decided to film the entire film in the guerrilla style, with non-stop cameras and quick cuts. This technique could work for scenes of violent violence, but it is totally inadequate for the rest of the material, which constitutes the majority of the film. A walk on the sidewalk, an argument from brother to brother on a couch, hell, even a kiss on a first date are all taken cusinart style, distracting this viewer from being able to enter the drama. Martin also undermines his narrative by including too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we have anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... Did I miss something? No doubt, a better deal (and a better focused direction) would have united these threads, as Martin intended, to demonstrate how a moral defect leads and sustains a large number of others ... but good intentions are not necessarily a great movie theater. Only an expanding mess. Martin, I know you're from my city and I agree with you, I really am ... do a better job next time, like you did in Two Plus One.
