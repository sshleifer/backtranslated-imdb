A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of the "strong women" played by Rozzie R. lies partly in his ability to defend his man (even when it was not worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought about this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'. <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She is the object of affection for two men: the crazy priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a soft white bread boy whose marriage is slowly fading. And he will not let any of them have a piece of it until ... <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending, but I will say that this is, ultimately, Bland Whitebread Boy's fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell works, he can not disguise the fact that this movie is basically a melodrama from the 1940s for the MTV generation. Except for their regressive class and gender politics they make those old black and white films look revolutionary by comparison.
