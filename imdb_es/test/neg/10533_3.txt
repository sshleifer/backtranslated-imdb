Half Past Dead was different from any Steven Segal movie I've seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the program. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything really new here, just the same as other movies that changed around a little one. The best action scenes were those of Nia, since once again she kicked hard. It was interesting to see her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons at Walker, Texas Ranger, who still kicked her ass, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
