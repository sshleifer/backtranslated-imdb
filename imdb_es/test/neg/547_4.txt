I discovered that this is a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the performance was generally pretty good. Reginald Owen chewed the landscape, as mentioned by others, but I found it moderately funny in his brief scenes. TCM has made me a fan of Ann Harding and I thought it was fine as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day like the old battle ax, ordering everyone, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan with a shine. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or the editing. --The transitions were uncomfortable, the motivations were murky. The movie was too short to convey the story correctly! I felt completely disappointed, particularly because I had such fond memories of the later version.
