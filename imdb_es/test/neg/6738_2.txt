This has to be the worst Steven Segal movie I've seen (even worse than the eco-piffle like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). I'll start with the positive points ... it has an elegant address for a DTV movie and it has a wonderful stage ... That's it! The story is not going anywhere, it's just a series of well-prepared pieces for Seagal to shoot at the bad guys (the count of bodies can easily equal Tarantino at its bloodiest point!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, you forget who the good and the bad are. The performance (I use the term lightly) is, at best, mediocre, the usual expression of seagal ONE constipation and the wooden interpretation I can take, but especially the others, the British were terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why do bad guys chase him? Is Seagal being configured? <br /> <br /> WHO GIVES IT AS ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie at my local Blockbuster (once I paid), the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the store I could have chosen! (I felt like punching him until he numbed my arm) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen Half Past Dead or Out for a kill yet and I do not dare come back for more humiliation in my store, but they can not be more impressive than this turkey. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is supposed to be young and modern. I just wanted half a dozen asprins. <br /> <br /> All In all this is Seagal at its WORST! The guy who has won around 100 pounds and seems to have got over it, is a guy who does not know when to stop, he should retire gracefully NOW! and go behind the camera or become a master of martial arts or something like that. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 point per scenario)
