Although I am not a big fan of the Coen brothers, I am an admirer of his black humor films like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing'. I have been much less impressed by his other comic modes, the fool's camp (or that Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'Oh brother, where are you?' falls in the last category and is not as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. <br /> <br /> 'O Brother' is basically a series of episode jokes without much sense, and not so much humor or intelligence either. As most critics have pointed out, the plot of the film is very informal. and, from what I could see, quite arbitrarily? based on the odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" as his namesake namesake and aims to "real" the return home to avoid the marriage of his wife Penny with a suitor. Of course, we did not discover that this is what the Clooney / Ulysses character really wants until long after we stop worrying. And what does Homer have to do with the bands of the "Cool Hand Luke" chain, Ku Klux Klan meets at the "Indiana Jones" worship meeting, a vocabulary of a disabled lawyer, a talent for the singing of country music from blue grass, an association with Baby Face Nelson? , a Clark Gable-looking hairstyle and other features and encounters of random and diverse characters? I leave that so that others can discern it. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturges' "Travels of Sullivan" in the title of "O Brother" is equally useless. Yes, viewers who are familiar with the classic Strangle comedy from Sturges might find it a bit rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie Sullivan abandons Hollywood and the comedy he hopes to make. And they can even be slightly funny for a couple of shot / scene riffs (for example, jumping freight cars, and the gang in the chain shuffles to watch a movie). And that? The Coen brothers do not seem to have anything to add to the debate of art for art compared to the high moral seriousness about the function of art. Obviously, they fall into the old school, but that does not seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. It is a tribute? If so, why do it? I like the reference of postmodern pop culture and the textual game as much as the next person, but it is much better when it comes to something at least tonally, if not thematically, coherently. and not just an arbitrary invention. <br /> <br /> This script is simply a disaster. The only consistent and always pleasant element is the folk / country music soundtrack. It does not have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but, considering the rest of the movie, it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack CD.
