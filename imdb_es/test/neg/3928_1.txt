I do not care what they say, this movie was crap. The only thing that was in his favor was the camera work, which was very well done. As for the dialogue, I've heard so many people talk about ... stunk too. Yes, he was honest and true to life, but what? I can hear someone talking like that on the street or at a fast food restaurant. What made the dialogue good in films like Pulp Fiction, and Gosford Park was the fact that it is a WRITTEN dialogue, which requires time to think. Another thing was that the director should not have been put in the picture. I think the male character could have been much stronger, but instead seemed weak. In fact, the movie seemed to revolve around the male character, and then disappears completely in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the film seemed completely repulsive to me, not in appearance, but in their needy aspects needed. Saying she's in love with a guy and actually being jealous of him the next day, what a shit fuck. The last thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope it was just something that affected my theater instead of being in the final cut of the movie. There was a constant buzzing during several scenes and he was actually moving away from the conversation. Another good thing was Blood's work as the DP, but the actress who played the ex-girlfriend of the main boy also did a very good job. These two things could not save a terrible movie in the end, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
