Recently, I came across this DVD while surfing Netflix, and with such an impressive cast, I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> I have never before seen a movie try to be a new version of a great existing movie (Scarface) and that it fails in a spectacular way. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "bad boy". His spectacular rise and eventual fall was not sad, it was a great (and the only logical end) for someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as director, writer and main actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero, or at least a complicated guy. However, he does not want to do the hard work of creating a realistic and understanding character. He was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood where his father, a gangster, showed him his life. For reasons that were never fully explained, they were not even really mentioned, he decides that he wants to be a drug dealer and, in reality, drives the bad part of the city, approaches two merchants and says: "Hey, I would like to buy some drugs. " He drops his father's name, and apparently, in a short time, not only are they rich, the two guys who are supplying him are acting slavishly with him for reasons, once again, they never explained it. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when your character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. However, since you have already distributed large quantities of drugs before, why should you feel sympathy for going to jail this time? The most obvious case that Chapa wants to be the good guy is in the execution in prison of a white Supremacist / rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in jail because he has to do it to get up, that's it, move on. But in this case, they have to make Busey not only a rapist / pedophile but also a white supremacist. A bit excessive, do not you think? In this regard, I will not go into much more detail, but your desperate message of "PLEASE LIKE ME! I AM A COMPLICATED GANGSTER!" It fails at all levels. No matter how hard they tried, I did not feel bad, conflicted or sympathetic when they killed their friends (after a shooting), they also killed his wife (shortly after she called him for being a lousy father, and during an attempt flight when he decided it would be good to travel right next to a car full of armed men while his wife is in the car, and his eventual death. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his performance can be summed up pretty lousy , his only achievement of bringing the term "wood" to new starry heights, Busey must be credited for putting really effort into his ridiculous role, Tiny Lister did it right, Stacy Keach plays her warden in the role of Prison Break Robert Wagner is going for a paycheck, Faye Dunaway, although a dramatic touch, still has a better performance than the film deserved Brad Dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. Credit to the film, makes Scarface one in a way: Jennifer Tilly now has the title of "The most ridiculous attempt for a Hispanic accent." (Sorry, Robert Loggia). In short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a poor history arc, unattractive characters and successful or missing performances. I would recommend Mr. Chapa to reduce the forced sympathy next time. Actually, it is not necessary that we like your character, we just need to be interested. Better luck next time.
