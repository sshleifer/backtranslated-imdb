Calling this movie a decent or pleasant horror tribute is too optimistic. Hell, you can not even refer to him as a simulation of the genre because he's way below average (it's funny, but not "haha, you know), but I still tell you to take a look. of trivial elements it contains, by the way, all the people who complain about this movie in their comments are only to blame.When you see the cover of the DVD of this movie, you should already know that it will not be on the same level as " The piano ", for example, so do not come complaining afterwards ... <br /> <br /> The evil Ed could have been something, but it completely ruined it.I suppose the main idea behind this film is the criticism Towards the growing "cutting committee" in today's horror, it shows an editor named Edward who is going crazy (well, not too slow) to see all the violence and gore in the movies produced. The big boss's name is Sam Campbell. It's funny, is not it? Personally, I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi, but for my Urprise there was not. Anyway, this guy got rich making movies called "Loose Limbs". Present (and I'm not kidding you!) Scenes in which a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) And then shot in the head by a bazooka! Now, who says that horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> With all the blood and "loose limbs", it's hard to believe but really gets bored very fast. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed becomes a complete bore and he never recovers from that. The only thing left to do then (in addition to pressing the eject button, of course) is to look for the obvious amount of references to other much better horror films. I also saw scenes stolen from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and many others. And there are also a lot of classic horror posters on the walls to admire. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed finds its origin in Sweden. I am convinced that there is a lot of talent there, in the far north (take the Danish "Nattevagten" as an example) ... but none of them joined the cast or team of Evil Ed. Just to see if you are in a state of foolish mood and you do not want to use your brain at all.
