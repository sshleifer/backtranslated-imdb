The first two hours of the televised version are full of characters and plot exposition: after a brief early sequence of Las Vegas hit by tornadoes, the action does not begin until two hours later. Even so, some character relationships are not clear until the second part. The actors deliver competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those of "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). An exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a fairly standard mix of parts of "Independence Day," "Speed," "The day after tomorrow," "Earthquake," "The hell of the tower" and several other movies. You can predict what will happen next, and get close to predicting the dialogue, word by word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in "Twister", the tornadoes in this movie seem less realistic than "The Wizard of Oz" and, obviously, other effects were made for less money than series like "CSI" and "Cold Case" spend in the whole of a single episode. If you have to watch a disaster movie made for television, see "The day after", "Asteroid" or "Special bulletin" instead: you'll get better graphics, performances and effects.
