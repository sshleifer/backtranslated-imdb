I saw this movie at Temple University. I can not imagine that someone will see this movie in a cinema (projected in a movie). The performance is similar to Saved By The Bell (The television program). The plot is simple and unimaginative. The sound recorder likes the sound of the wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, vampires, vampires. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
