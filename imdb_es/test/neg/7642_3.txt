I am surprised at the number of people who have qualified this entry as their favorite "Chan" (did they never see "... at the Opera" or "... on Treasure Island?", This last one Ironically written by John Larkin, who dropped the ball here). This plot is a train crash and is overloaded with meaningless characters. First, viewers are required to remember the sordid details of the 1929 murder spree by Steve McBirney (played by the venerable thug and thief of HUAC Marc Lawrence). Let's not forget that he escaped from a murder for capital murder in court with a lone cop in the queue. There is also a victim who was taken from a river 11 years earlier so no one seems worried. Then there is the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters seem to be stuck in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to handle his wet, fat backside inside a window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Cream's assistant) in this movie? You can not even handle the pliers correctly. I realize that Chan suffers the same booing, but yes, he is 66 years old here (and has less than 10 lines) and his character's motivation is too weak to be so. I speak properly (excuse me, when I'm in a tirade that I write as Ricky Ricardo). The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as an eager-eyed imbecile, who apparently exists only because of Horndog's useless romantic interest. the lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne with the face of a ferret). Why is Willie Fern a character? Why did not McBirney's henchman make the change at 8:20? (It's not a spoiler, okay?) One wonders how, with the intellectual coefficient of the fluff that manages to dress himself or why he had not stopped in front of a bus for years. Toler himself is given a bit more rope than usual (a plus) and the real thanks go to the stage designer Thomas Little and the filmmaker Virgil Miller, who created a really creepy atmosphere ... but this entry has less logic that a movie by Ritz Brothers. until you are surprised at how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun.
