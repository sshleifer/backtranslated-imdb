I must preface this comment with a kind of admission: I guess I only have a weakness for the original TV series of the 60s and 70s. I think the filmmakers here did it from the beginning to the casting: in a supposed remake, the audience I would look for reflexes from the hip, the athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III), or the great one, with him Michael Cole, and so on. Instead, we have Giovanni Ribisi as a rich, poor and small child, who becomes pathetic, as it's in all its roles (in the office where I worked, I entertained myself once by creating a fake movie poster, selecting several actors as staff members of the office, guess who I select as dorky's son from the president of the company?). The Danes do well as the new Julie, but none of the characters has much to do, as the story stays there, steeped in conventionality. So it's pretty forgettable, too. What was he talking about?
