Before the airport 79 'these movies were pretty good. They had decent special effects, star cast and good acting. This movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for that. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! They are horrible, what the director was thinking. I know it's only 1979, but let's see other very good special effects films like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord and this could have been the best movie of Airport, but they did too much with it. What if Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) fires a flare from the window of the cabin, to prevent a missile in search of heat from hitting the concord? He is also doing dips and loops of 90 degrees. This completely crazy, and WOW unrealistic! Believe me, special effects do not help this scene, and they really are more than poor ... They almost look like a caricature, and that's how the whole movie is. Finally, let's talk about the performance that, in my opinion, is. Extremely poor at just the best of times ... About acting is an important issue in this film, especially George Kennedy ... What I really like as an actor, but I do not like it in this movie. The fault lies with the director, who did a very poor editing job, and really eliminated the Airport Franchise. Too bad that the Concord is not used today, it was a marvel of air travel ...
