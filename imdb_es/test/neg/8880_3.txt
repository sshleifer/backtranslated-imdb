I had to watch this DVD, thinking that I would see a kind of biography of the painter Goya, but the film was about anything but Goya. This film is about a young girl who was taken from her family by the Holy Inquisition, supposedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humiliation, driven by a poor script (I can not believe it's because of JC Carri√®re, since I can not believe that this cr ** is directed by Mr. Milos Forman) focused on a man religious and that young woman and that's it. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is Goya, I forgot, playing a completely peripheral role, that could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone. Very disappointing: one of these movies that will be forgotten forever (if it has not happened yet). Rent "The name of the rose" if you want a movie about the Holy Inquisition. And I do not know what to rent, if you want to see a movie about the Spanish painter Goya. Maybe a director of good caliber, not Forman, still needs to do it. PD: the Spanish painter Goya, the leading role that is lost in the plot, is represented by a Scandinavian actor, something that makes this film even more difficult to take seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to interpret the biographical film of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
