A former police officer who was expelled from force for recklessness (and who could probably beat Chuck Norris in a fight) is hired as a private bodyguard; Your first client is a kind of playboy without value. Half of the film is needed for her to be ejected from the force in the first place. A lot of great fight choreography, but the plot is strictly by numbers, and the performance is as much wood as the dialogue. Give this a fault.
