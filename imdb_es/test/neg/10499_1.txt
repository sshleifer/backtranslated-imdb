A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday, and I was very surprised that someone could make such a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Mix the most horrible and clich√© dialogue, with the most wooden performance you've ever seen, with the tastiest special effects for man, and you get this magnificent beast! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is more fun than most of the comedies I've seen, it's really horrible! <br /> <br /> During the scene, the character of the former police / murderer vampire is having a coffee with the internet journalist. Just look at it and you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not believe that someone has done this with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but really fun. It has to be seen to be believed.
