The Kissing Bandit was the third and last film in which Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co-starred in MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And on both Sinatra he courted and lost Grayson. I guess the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> Maybe for romance, but definitely not for the screen image. Sinatra in his forty films, once again plays the cute little guy just this time with bullfighter pants. Poaching in the territory of Tyrone Power established in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who owned a hotel during the day and The Kissing Bandit at night. He left and left California for an education and came back ready to take Dad's place, but only in the hotel business. And where does the hotel business learn, Boston? <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Dad's former gang members, who have become a little old and poor, led by J. Carrol Naish, want me to re-direct the gang. But Frank is not made for illegal living. But it does make a good impression on the daughter of the Governor, Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone must have had the opportunity for Sinatra at MGM to cast him after the bad reviews he received at Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a part that was more suited to Red Skelton. But since it was a musical, I think that the mental trust in MGM meant that Kathryn Grayson had to have a co-star singer. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best movie number is for her, Love Is Where You You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse make a dance specialty that is enjoyable. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In later years, Sinatra would shudder at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and rightly so.
