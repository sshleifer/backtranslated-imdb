You simply can not touch NRFPTP! The new harvest is just horrible. The jokes are not fun. Some members of the company make me want to stop watching TV all together. Lorne, you've let your creation go down the toilet. The guests are sometimes good, the bands are mostly junk. Weekend update, Seth has to tell the audience when to laugh ... Seth would have a proper reception at a Baghdad cafe ... However, make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 jokes in total and Solo keeps repeating them over and over again. Even the segments that obviously are not fun. Offending people has become the name of the game, but they can not even do it right. Only offensively. I am very disappointed with what happened with the show, but now I also know that it is safe to go out on a Saturday night.
