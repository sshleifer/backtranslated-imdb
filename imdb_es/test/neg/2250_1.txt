I will never see another Tarantino movie again. The whole movie was worth nothing. My wife and I regret that we did not get up and leave at the first sign of what the movie was really going to be (which is still difficult to determine since it was such a ridiculous story ... blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real issue, but we were still hoping there was something around the corner Unfortunately, there was not because there was nothing that made sense! We, along with many other people in the audience, left the theater muttering "that was disgusting" , "what a waste of time", "I should have left", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. It really made us, the audience, express our disgust and the feeling that we had just been The only thing of merit in the film was the costumes and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film ... there was simply no plot / script worthy of their talent, I rate this with a 1 because there is no 0. I can not Ender how someone could rate this higher than a 0!
