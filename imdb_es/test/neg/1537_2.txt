Well, the writing was very neglected, the address was more neglected and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was the edition). The performance was not bad, but it was not so good either. practically none of the characters was nice. At least 45 minutes of that film was wasted time and the other approximately hour was not used anywhere near its maximum potential. It was a great idea, but another good idea is missing. It could have ended in 3 different places, but it kept moving towards a mostly predictable Hollywood ending. and what was not predictable became so bad that it did not matter. It was not worth seeing the end. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from this kind of movies. The movie seemed rushed too. The movie was not really worth seeing, and if I had paid it, I would have been very angry. maybe I was disappointed more because I was expecting a really good movie and I got a bad one. The film especially was not horribly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave 2 of 10 b / c. I really liked the idea and I liked a character (justin I think, the super smart). and also had some very cheap ways to cover the holes in the plot. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap tape, it was not pretty. Anyway, if you see it, wait for the theater or video for $ 1.50, unless you like all the movies you see, then I think you'll like this one.
