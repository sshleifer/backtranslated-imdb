This movie simply seemed to lack direction. The plot developed so many twists in such a short time that it seemed to lose some semblance of what the true story was. There were a lot of wasted dialogues and it seemed that the writing was hasty and too erratic. The scenes of exorcism and the history of possession began to recede to the later stories of the character (which to begin with were a little weak). <br /> <br /> In general, I would say do not do it, unless you have rented. The rest of the horror section in your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you have not seen before. You're much better watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
