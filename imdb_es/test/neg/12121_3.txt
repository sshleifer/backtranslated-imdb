Unfortunately, it's a boring movie and, obviously, the only way to see it is the pirated public domain version, which is so fuzzy and obscure that, sometimes, it's hard to find where the screen is. The main actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his time on the screen trying to look indifferent, charming and sexy, completely forgetting what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of a lady who interpreted it as a goose to begin with. The lady herself simply walks through the movie, being dignified if she is not busy looking cute. It's a pretty badly written thing, never interesting or witty. It does not work well with the camera, there is no memorable soundtrack, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric scenarios. Only scratch the surface of the genre, and nothing happens if you miss this totally impossible movie.
