Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare find. A movie that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making several action films and B-grade thrillers, some of them with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny and her two daughters, Sarah and Emma, ​​arrive in the city of Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move into a large house that Karen's last husband had after finding the deed of a miner in its effects. Once they arrive, they find that the house is very old and in need of repair. But the condition of the house is the least of its problems, since they discover that the area is prone to disappearances and Karen is confronted by the owner of the area and ordered to move. Once the night falls, the Tunnys discover the reason behind the disappearances: a group of zombie children, killed in a collapse of a mine in the area more than 85 years ago, go out to kill anything that goes in the forest. With the help of a graying neighbor, Karen tries to end the curse before she and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD waiting for a movie with zombies that eat meat, but I was disappointed. One thing: the movie is more like a ghost story than its usual zombie movie, and the dead children are the incarnation of a curse that torments the forest, taking revenge on anything that moves at night (although the logic internal is somewhat defective (children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals and are repelled by the blood rooms on the doors in the same way that vampires are repelled by garlic and mirrors) is not supposed to these children are zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem and would be really entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie movie, only to fall flat on their face with this effort. <br /> <br /> As such, a movie like this would be fine as a ghost story but, due to a bad script, it becomes nothing more than a completely routine effort. The greatest strength of the film is the performance, with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves. Of particular interest is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does his part quite well? it's a shame that it ruins his genre reputation with a very bad performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
