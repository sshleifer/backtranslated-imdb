I was thrilled when the movie started (because I saw the name of Juliette Lewis on the screen). The script seemed very complicated first, but as the film continued, it became understandable. I concentrated on that, but the result was disappointing. the object of sex was used too much in the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignores those who have a tendency to the opposite sex. In my opinion, the well-prepared script could not be incorporated. When we look at the cast, the film promises something at the beginning or just waited too much ... and finally the end ... the ending is so mediocre that I did not expect it. Cassandra, the protagonist, wants to give a message about having a baby and how a baby can do it. Change a life, in my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the movie. In general, the characters are fun and act perfectly. But the cast can not save a movie.
