Oh, if you ever want to see a supernatural thriller that turns into a comedy, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was shocking, as it had many actors, but what do they do and how do they fit? <br /> <br /> The handling of the scenes of the university is like a play in which each person speaks and then the next person comes forward. <br /> <br /> Very good reasons to laugh at the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as college students 2) Akshay carries a gun in college 3) Some pathetic acrobatics and SFX <br /> <br /> There are several more faults like why the snake does not save His lover from being raped and arrives so late? also why do not they kill them all together there alone? <br /> <br /> But after all, they have to make a 2 h + movie so, therefore, you have a tortorius movie <br /> <br /> The movie It's painful to watch it. The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli, who was an expert in this type of film in the past and had a successful record of films such as JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN. Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's nonexistent career. From VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all the failures he made to promote his son and that also throws big stars for his son to be noticed, unfortunately nothing could help his son's career <br /> <br /> The film has several comic scenes like the scenes of death, how the actors after being hit by the snake are so apt to fight against him and the climax <br /> <br /> The Rajkumar Kohli's direction is bad Music is bad <br /> <br /> That brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary things, he does not have much to do instead of the stunts Suneil Shetty, the horrible Sonu Nigam, the worst deb. is awarded the utante award, gives the cartoon a new meaning Aftab-terrible Arshad Wars- nothing to do Sharad Kapoor- bad Aditya Panscholi- irritates Sunny Deol- is comical in the scene when it comes to saving Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala - ordinary Rambha - The couple of Akshay, Kiran Kumar, Race Murad, are as usual, Raj Babbar. They are very funny for the wrong reasons. The girls are horrible. This brings us to Munish Kohli. This guy has a huge physique, he's even stronger and taller than Akshay Kumar. Akshay of the poor man. His voice is horrible, his expressions are painful. All he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make a wicked face. Rajat Bedi is horrible.
