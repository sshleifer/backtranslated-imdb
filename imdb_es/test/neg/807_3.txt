Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotyped role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite Coon dog. However, the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps behind him. It soon becomes clear that, although Hunnicutt and his dog were wandering around after leaving the water, both died in the water, since no one responds when he talks to them and he sees and hears people talking about his death and the dog's death . However, interestingly, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow in acceptance and it takes a while to understand that they are talking about him. I think this was actually done as a filler, since there really was not enough material to fill the space for half an hour. <br /> <br /> Later, in the "surprise turn", you encounter the sky, or at least your concept of the place. He is invited, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! In general, reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! Without twists or ironies, this episode is a bit boring, it is not enough "Twilight Zone-and" for my taste.
