I do not know which was worse, the viewer was made to waste, or the stars in this movie that look like drugs. Should I believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never realized that the child was a bit dark? Should I believe that her mother, her father and her husband never once said, hmmm, does this child look a little dark? Should I believe that when the courts ordered the mother to see the records of the adoptive parents, that Lisa Hartman had that look of astonishment when she told her mother that Christopher is half black? What ! That was serious, do you think? So not only the grandmother, and the grandfather looked foolish and foolish, not once did they mention this, but I suppose we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm, my God, it's half black! Totally stupid movie, almost an embarrassment to even see this!
