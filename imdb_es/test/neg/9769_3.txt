I'm going to be generous here and I'll give it a 3 just because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. That said, this movie was pretty bad. It's as if they started with almost no script and the director just told the actors to look at each other in a meaningful way with a lot of music playing on him. And Billy D. Williams seemed to prefer to be anywhere but in this movie. It's just a disaster. I think I could write a script better than the scrolling of this movie, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I have seen mentioned in all the reviews and the message boards: they are all under the impression that the movie starts around World War II and, in reality, it seemed that I supposed it had to start in the late fifties and early sixties. While the army was not segregated by then, I'm pretty sure the troops waiting to board a train would remain segregated in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the movie was supposed to start in the 1940s, then Billy D, Lesley Ann and Rae Dawn should have been in the 70s and 80s instead of the 50s or early 60s. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you really like the actors because the story is not very interesting.
