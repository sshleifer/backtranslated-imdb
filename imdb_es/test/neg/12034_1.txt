I'm so glad I was not alive to see this. This film is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commentator: this movie was a terrible disappointment. I would give it a zero, but I am forced to give it a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a teenager trying to write a movie. looking back and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to finance it was how it was done. It is really amazing how you can pull the strings to do something. If this film was able to reach the general public, it places high hopes on other independent filmmakers who have worthwhile and struggling talents. This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts this was not meant seriously to be a comedy. The scary movie is a better game in a horror genre, this movie just sucks.
