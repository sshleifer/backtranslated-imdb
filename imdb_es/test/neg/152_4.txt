Frankie Muniz plays Jason, who is a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is based on small or big lies that put him in trouble most of the time. However, he can not escape from his teacher and finishes his creative writing task just before the deadline. While he is riding a fast bike to deliver his homework to the teacher, he crushes himself in a car. While explaining the situation to the grumpy man (Giamatti) in the car, he takes him to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way of saying this is that Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals it. <br /> <br /> After a few months, Jason goes to see a movie and sees a trailer that has him bewildered because the story of the film is based on his task. He tells his parents, but, of course, they do not believe him. Especially his father uses words that insult him. Jason decides to go to Los Angeles and look for Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses, Jason takes action and ruins his life. <br /> <br /> This is the short story of Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie it could be a little cheery, but there are some mistakes that you might even ask if that's possible. For example, having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to solve the problem, having access to the highly protected house and office of this film producer, establishing a telecommunications system overnight. Does it seem credible? It is not like this. Well, this is a movie for children, but children are not so gullible. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar offers a little pleasure to your target audience. Unfortunately, I'm not a big liar to say that this is a good movie. ** outside *****
