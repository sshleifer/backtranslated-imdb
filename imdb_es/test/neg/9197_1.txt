I'm sorry, maybe this is part of the wave of praise for firefighters since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not made to take off your socks, but I'm sorry, this movie is horrible. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least as many clichés. It is a lugubrious story (the impressive management of being sad when there are fires and dangerous lives is being saved) about a firefighter. And his lugubrious life, told in a useless, 'scene from now' returns to the past style. We started the movie with the hero in danger in a burning building that collapsed. The whole movie is about making us love this guy, so we pulled some tears when he finds his end at the end of the scene from the beginning of the movie. It cost me to take care of myself and I wished I had smoked before. Clichés abound, such as: the death of the best friend, love in the first place, hazing in a new job, the firstborn, a wife worried with a husband with a dangerous job, a father figure boss / superior, 2.4 children (well 2 but close enough), sacrificing your life to save others, awards for courage ... again and again. It's the life of every fireman, every police officer, nurse, doctor in some way. He was lazy, if it was a "life that flashes before his eyes" when he died, then God helps the poor guy. I'm surprised that I have not vacuumed more smoke to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, they act properly and with a soundtrack that could make The Laughing Cow stop working, it was so corny, it actually sounded like a muzak or elevator things without copyrights! It should be avoided at all costs unless you need something to see with the grandmother on a Sunday night. Or maybe if you are related to a firefighter - warning - your life will end horribly or you will be frightened for life if you are a brave firefighter according to this movie. Unless you're John Travolta (strange velcro style hair on this one !!)
