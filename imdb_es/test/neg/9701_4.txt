Let me start by saying that I love the book and I loved the A & E miniseries. I expected to love this movie and I was absolutely willing to allow you a moderate degree of artistic license to interpret and abbreviate the real story. However, this movie just looks like the original book. If only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent," he might have enjoyed the movie as a piece of an entertaining, albeit inaccurate, period. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, putting the name "Mr. Darcy" on a character who is emotional and weak, who gives the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, cunning, often teary-eyed man who does not he worries about the rules of society, and that turns "Mr. Bingley" into an imbecile completely destroyed eyes The idea that the director had ever read the original story of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> There are some really stellar moments in this movie, maybe a total of 10 minutes are really excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins's proposal begins wonderfully. She is 27 years old (quite close to the time of the desperate in those times), is becoming a burden for her family and is not romantic. She just wants "a comfortable home". However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when he says: "Do not judge me, Elizabeth, do not you dare to judge me!" and it escapes in tears. Later, you will see Charlotte surrender to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not at all in character as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good time is when Darcy catches Elizabeth at her house while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A & E series, but the film's version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel extremely humiliating for the moment that it should have been for Elizabeth. Very pretty. <br /> <br /> The ending also illustrated a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that did not show up as obviously in the miniseries. I really appreciated that scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, instead of just knowing that it took place. <br /> <br /> However, taken together, this film eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of Austen's pride and prejudice. The characters speak in a discordant combination of Austen's literal dialogue with modern and colloquial phrases. The information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is clearly indicated in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's just a short movie, Yada Yada. But turning a beautiful and complex book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy sees Elizabeth for the first time, because it is obviously a case of "love at first sight". Love at first sight? Eh One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and Darcy comes to love her for her wit and vitality ... he literally "loves her for her mind". <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first proposal) when the two are shouting furiously, as they lean closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but suddenly separate Ugh! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and disgusted with each other, but they are so attracted that it does not matter that (in that moment) they do not even like each other. Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characterizations were so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. Mr. Bennet was stern, Elizabeth used to be as stupid as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate to have a home of her own, unlike the intelligent woman, somewhat intriguing, with a lot of sense common that is presented in the novel. Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is merely topical, instead of the deep love and admiration that they are supposed to have for each other. <br /> <br /> All this I could have accepted simply as misinterpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept all that in addition to the many, many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley walked barely dressed (her dress resembled what others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and let fly everywhere. The family relaxed about one morning, although it was assumed that the mornings were reserved to call acquaintances (or to be called to their own home). Elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown. And in a really scary scene, Bingley went into Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. <br /> <br /> Most people would feel that these are minor points, but I simply wanted them to be A.) a historically accurate movie, or B.) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / whoever sacrificed precision, subtlety and a good story for a trite story of love at first sight. I can admit that people who have not read the book or are not familiar with the social conventions of the time might like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just could not get over my desire to see a movie that involved more than just two pretty faces.
