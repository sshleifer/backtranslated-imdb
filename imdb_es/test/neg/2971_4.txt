The silly comedy throws the embarrassed Ray Milland like a British officer in World War II, Europe escaping the German confines and confronting a gypsy hungry for men, played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow pace, too long and cranky: the cables are too old for this type of juvenile forage, although Marlene shines in its moments alone. It took three screenwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes's book to the screen, but this material must have seemed old-fashioned in 1947: it smells like something Ernst Lubitsch could have produced in 1939. The stage is moldy and the stars have absolutely nothing. The chemistry as a whole. ** since ****
