This is not a very good movie, but it's easily the best Troma Studios movie I've seen. Lloyd Kaufman, the "brain" behind Troma, does not care about a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining movie. His main concern is to do something strange. And his definition of bizarre often reflects my definition of terrible cinema. <br /> <br /> In this film we have the character named Luther, whose favorite pastime is not baseball, but who kills the heads of the chickens, receiving his release. from the blockade. The board has considered him rehabilitated despite the fact that he does not speak (he simply sings like a chicken) and has a set of razor blade dentures at his disposal. Of course, once Luther is released, he begins to cause chaos, first at a grocery store and then on a farm. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Much violence in this case many times without taste Luther sinks his razor blade chompers into a poor old woman who waits at a bus stop and then passes the rest of the movie terrorizing the mother and daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk offers some remarkable skin in her photo, since the former Lois Lane (I do not remember what edition of Superman she was) gives us a shower scene followed from a romp in bed with her boyfriend, a guy who just does not do it ... I have no chemistry with Ms. Haiduk The extended sequence of the shower scene in the DVD extras gives the viewer a bit more of Stacy She is something quite). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (Forget it!) The Whitey Styles script may be the worst thing ever written.The way in which Luther is freed from asylum throws all credibility out of the window altogether. it is something that a preschooler could write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd.It is as if the Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forget how people react in certain situations). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The movie belongs to Edward Terry who actually does a decent job like the Geek.) He is quite menacing in a stupid corral way, Joan Roth, as the mother makes an excellent support work, but the lack of chemistry of Haiduk and her boyfriend made their roles uncomfortable at best).
