I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. The standard has been established. Never again will I give a movie to 1, unless it is as horrible as this one. I totally agree with the other comments about this movie. But, as I am Dutch, I saw it with Dutch translation. Apparently, they had no money for an adequate translation, so they decided to take care of them. With sometimes hilarious results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not take drugs, do not look at Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can not believe I said that). I did not have the script (was there any?) In his hands while shooting. I think they also did a good job in ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they did not do a good job at all.
