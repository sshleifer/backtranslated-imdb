I was quite excited to see this movie when it came out. The commercials made it look peculiar and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I felt terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've generally found that graphic violence and comedy do not go so well together, and the only directors who have combined the two successfully are, in my opinion, Tarantino and the Coens. There's not much violence in Nurse Betty, but the violence in her made me feel a little weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there did not seem to be many places to which they asked me. <br /> <br /> The movie does not work like a drama either. The Betty of Renee Zellweger, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and it is impossible to relate in a real way. I'll say that Zellweger fulfills the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear also do good jobs. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person who plays an interesting character. It is really very bad. 3/10
