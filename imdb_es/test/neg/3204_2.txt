(SMALL SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I could not believe what had happened. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 movies, the creatures at least had a sense of humor (especially the third movie), but not only did the creatures just appear, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story started well. After an hour, I remembered that the Critters movies were always very short. So I thought: "Where are the $ ^% # $ creatures?!?!" They were hardly in this movie! If that did not infuriate me enough, the boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie had "killed the ship" and knew that the creatures were still on board! In the first film, the Brown family was beside themselves. But here, Ethan did not even care! It was as if the bugs were not a threat! <br /> <br /> Now, what I'm going to say next can ruin the end, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, in the end, they had to face the giant creature for a final battle. In the second, there was the big critter ball. In the third movie, the creature with its burned favorite made a spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and was going to attack the boy. But at the end of the room (which is what made me more angry), the bald creature throws itself at Ethan, and Ethan kills it as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> Now, something I really do not do. I understood what happened to Ug. It was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then, after 50 years, he is evil. That was very disappointing. Not only that, but was not he a faceless bounty hunter? Why was it still "Johnny Steele"? In addition, he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotonous as in the first two. <br /> <br /> Being someone who really enjoyed the first two critters movies, and loved the third, I give Critters 4 a 2/10
