I had the unfortunate experience of having stumbled upon a preview of this movie and thought it might be interesting. I'm a fan of the two main actors, and I even think that Meatloaf is strangely attractive, but that could not make up for the plot of this movie. This movie tries to make social comments and be cleverly intelligent. I am sure that the audience clearly receives the sociological message, but has to suffer in the process. Personally, no matter how bad the movie is, I can not stop it in the middle. Something drives me to end the worst of the movies, but I often regret it. This is one of these...
