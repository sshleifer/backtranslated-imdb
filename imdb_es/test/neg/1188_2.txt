As a fan of the three television series, I was very interested to know that LoG was moving towards the big screen. However, in my most honest moments, I had my doubts about the possible success of the concept, and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit, comedy and horror that the original series infuses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded, and the movie was a big disappointment. I find it hard to understand the other comments on this site. Obviously, people have a right to their opinions, but the guys I saw them with, they all agree with me, and they are as big fans as me. <br /> <br /> The performance lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when they are not at their best, they are still highly visible. The main problem was the plot and the script. There was some laughter, but not enough, some moments of disgust, but not enough. The worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. Very rarely have I felt so uninspired by a movie and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> I write this comment as a warning to other fans of the League: get a wide range of opinions about this film before I go to see it If you love the League, you could convince yourself that they did not completely ruin your movement to the cinema . If you can not convince yourself of this, then you will have blurred in your mind the otherwise impeccable genius that exemplifies the television series. <br /> <br /> LoG at the movies? More like registration. (or little brown fish).
