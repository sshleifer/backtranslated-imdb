THE QUICKIE (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Very bad movie ... an old story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to give up, and passes his empire to his inept son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to simply give up ... so a contract is exposed in your life. After organizing a big party, an exterminator is called to the scene (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I suppose will "never" act on anything other than television movies or low-budget direct trash to video). Our "hero" makes a pass ... offering him a large amount of money for a "fast" ... she rejects his offer, although he needs the money ... but ends up staying overnight ... even after being brutally harassed by the over-enthusiastic son who believes he was sent to kill his father. Ugh The story goes on and on ... you can see every "turn" and "turn" that comes a mile away. The strange soundtrack of a group called "The Tiger Lillies" will make most people go crazy ... but I thought there was a great kind of track towards the end. Or maybe he was just excited because he could see that the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
