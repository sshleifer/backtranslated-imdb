First things first, how can someone with their creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this? I saw this movie and after a couple of hours they left me scratching my head, what exactly is the director trying to say. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller, there is no emotion, if it is action, there is no action. the action, unless it is a sequence of persecution, there is no Drama, and the much hyped love story, never really takes off. There is no passion, emotion, there is nothing. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never expected wonders from the movie, however, after opening the bumper that I took, I thought I'd give it a try. I do not have any problem with Himesh Reshamiya at all, and I'm not one of the guys that will hit him every chance he gets. I entered with an open mind and came out with a closed one. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a newcomer. But the direction, the script, the writing, the makeup, everything went wrong. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very rigid and it would take a long time to climb the curve. He can do the kind paperwork. Hansika is just a girl, and she looks on the screen with her fat baby and the way she walks. <br /> <br /> The only actor that was good was Himesh's friend in the movie, I do not know his friend. name, but it looks promising. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk, it is not even good to see it during a time pass. <br /> <br /> ** I strongly recommend avoiding this movie. **
