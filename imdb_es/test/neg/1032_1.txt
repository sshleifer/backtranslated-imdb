Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I am not opposed to extremely high salaries for many of today's artists and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady have good business with 8 figures, or the low-9 zone. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could become billionaires for their shows, huge waste and fees they currently demand. Even its cast members, and the entire group of "Amigos" reached close to or more than 7 figures per episode. Letterman's winnings for a program could solve most people's financial problems, and one or two weeks deal with many for life. <br /> <br /> But all these are based on solid principles of supply / demand and the financial benefits that they obtain. bring your employers. And all perform their jobs skillfully. <br /> <br /> But then someone like Rachel Ray appears, who reaches a level of earnings well above any apparent level of talent or ability. I find it shrill, annoying and with a forced "laziness" that is as false as the proverbial "3 dollar bill". <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for her firm and its subsidiaries. One of the main sources of talent has hundreds of clients available from the $ 5-10K level, to a few who get $ 200K and more per occurrence. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams and, without jokes, Larry the Cable Guy). <br /> <br /> There is a greater number in the range of $ 100,001 to 200,000; The list included the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even Larry's benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I guess I must admit that there may be enough demand for your "talent" and offers to justify your talk show and there may be some who pay more than $ 100K, + first class flights, hotel suite, all door expenses and limos at the door, for only a couple of hours of your chatter at your organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can not imagine how the hell this could be possible.
