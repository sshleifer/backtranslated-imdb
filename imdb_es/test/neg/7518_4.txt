The Time Machine begins in New York during 1899, where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes marriage to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who, unfortunately, just after being attacked by an assailant, Emma dies to shots and dies in the arms of Alexander. He jumps forward "Four years later" and Alexander has built a time machine that he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed to save her, but she is still murdered, only in a different way. Alexander realizes what he does, however, many times he returns, Emma will always end up dead in one way or another, and he longs to know the answer, and that's why he travels to the future to discover the truth. However, after destroying the moon, two new races have evolved on Earth, humans like Eloi and the monstrous Morlock that eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to stay and save Eloi. <br /> <br /> Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great-grandson of the author HG Wells, who wrote the original book of The Time Machine in which The Time Machine (1960) appeared. the film was based and in fact it is the film of 1960 on which the script of the producer John Logan is based, instead of the original source of Wells. While the three share the same story and basic ideas, this remake adds the secondary plot about the death of Alexander's girlfriend, Emma, ​​and that's why she invents a time machine instead of just because he is intelligent and can. The script is a mix of science fiction, action adventure and drama, none of which really captivated me or compromised me so much, certainly there are some pretty special effects, some nice action scenes and the moment when the question is answered Alexander on why he can not save. Emma is quite intelligent and makes sense, has never captured my imagination and has not moved me either. Time Time's aspects of The Time Machine are very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense that you can not change the past, but at the same time the future is not defined. The Time Machine is not that close. Good movie like Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The characters are fine, although I thought that Guy Pearce seemed too young to be an intelligent scientist capable of inventing a time machine and there is never a real explanation behind his mechanics, since it seems that in a moment there is no time machine that he himself has invented and created. One and it works perfectly. I recognize that the Back to the Future trilogy offers much more emotion, laughter, excitement and entertainment value in general than The Time Machine, and although I will not say it is a bad movie as it moves at a decent pace, it says a reasonable story and it has moments that I would not call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a small reference to the book and the original film that are mentioned here. <br /> <br /> The benefit that this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects and, in particular, the CGI that leads to scenes of time that quickly pass around Alexander in his time machine, with huge buildings under construction, new crests, canyons and mountains that are forming, and an elaborate tray that ends in space when we see passenger rockets orbiting the Moon. Effect work is good, there are one or two moments that look a bit below the average, but in general the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on TV and the station was playing incorrectly and was scanning it so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut out of the screen, thus cutting part of the year on the dial of Alexander's time machine , so I did not really know what year it was. Apparently, director Gore Verbinski took charge of the last eighteen days of filming, since Wells was suffering from "extreme exhaustion", while IMDb says that the time machine was the largest and most expensive accessory ever built for a movie at that moment, which I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene, but as a soldier he went on. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 80,000,000, the production values ​​are high with a period of loving recreation in New York and the good effect works although Surprisingly, The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar best makeup, but lost to Frida (2002). The performance is mixed, Jermey Irons performs a good performance in a terrible make-up job that makes it look like a rejection of a Lord of the Rings movie, while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big-screen debut here and is simply Terrible, although Guy Pearce It's pretty good and quite nice. <br /> <br /> The time machine is not a particularly bad movie nor a good one, but a rather striking movie that can be seen and spends an hour and a half, but not much more. . Look back to the future (1985) again in its place.
