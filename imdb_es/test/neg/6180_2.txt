This is what is good about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br />: Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse give excellent performances. Gosling is, as always, quite remarkable. The places are often impressive. <br /> <br /> This is what is wrong about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything else. The script is terribly confusing. And although I can certainly appreciate a movie that does not "feel good", this movie is simply boring. Great performances can not make up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is full of disposable lines that often do not even make sense. The simple act of spending the first hour became a chore. <br /> <br /> I kept that for Gosling, but in the end I did myself a favor and changed the channel. The spoilers here gave me the ending. I did not miss much. Do yourself a favor: if you want a good Gosling movie, check out "The Believer". <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
