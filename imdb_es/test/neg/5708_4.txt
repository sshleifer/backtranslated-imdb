A woman who is dedicated to art begins to have a passionate love story with a man named John. They make love wherever they go and play sex games. The problem I had was that it was all they did. There was no plot in this movie or I just did not see it. The hot erotic passion was the best of this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or she might have had a secret. I just needed something and all there was was a lot of love scenes. Not that it was bad or anything, I just wanted more things to happen in the movie. Maybe a co-worker was also sleeping with him. Anything! It bothered me a lot that this was all there was to it. Mickey Rourke was so hot back then. I wonder what happened.
