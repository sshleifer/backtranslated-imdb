I remember browsing the channels on HBO and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've seen in my life. There is no emotion in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. She stays with a couple who, coincidentally, had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townspeople agree that they looked alike. The thing is that Laura was murdered more than a year ago. Her boyfriend disappeared almost at the same time she was killed, so it seems that he had killed her. <br /> <br /> While settling in this city for a while, Drew begins to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares could prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer after all. Throughout the film, you discover that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is the one who raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long and very boring. The movie goes on and on and on and on. Surprisingly, I saw another TV movie after this call (Cloned) from 1997, which was good, but I will review it later. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst television movie of 1997!
