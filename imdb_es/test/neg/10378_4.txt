Is the meter of the Cannes controversy remarkably esoteric, or is it that Americans are so insensitive and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines? Be that as it may, with a lot of careful analysis, "Falscher Bekenner" at no time seems to match the exaggerated controversy that supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a disconcertingly monotonous and aimless film that rather lives up to its brilliance U.S. -title ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on familiar themes of Bourgeoise's anguish and subsequent sexual release (kind of), it is true that it is a film not without the interests of the surface. It begins with a captor, while a disturbing shot of a desolate road off the road focuses on a teenage drifter, who ultimately walks in a total car, where supposedly a brutal blow and race has left the driver dead. a bloody mess. Surprised, he does nothing more than pick up a piece of the remaining motor. <br /> <br /> Just out of school, the drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persistently pressed by his loving parents but somewhat annoyed to find a good job, he endures interview after interview with each arrogant interviewer, all with the same unsuccessful result. Having just got tired, his aforementioned meeting on the highway soon provoked his first act of rebellion: taking responsibility for the crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Pretending to fill more applications and go to more and more bizarre job interviews at dawn, engaging in sexual fantasies on the road and petty vandalism shortly after sunset. As the days get shorter and the nights get much warmer, he continues to live in his suburban neighborhood as if he were not doing anything out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> If you seem confused about exactly what is happening, do not worry about being the only one: it's about consistency with the story. The plot seems quite simple, and perhaps due to its apparently direct purposes, that is why "Falscher Bekenner" becomes intricately meaningless, falling in love with endless false conclusions, dream situations and graphic sex scenes to try to illuminate a story that lacks a clear logic for a vague Argument (supposedly the numbing effects of the soul of the modern suburban wastelands, or something about the youth's fascination with crime.) Hey, it could even be an upcoming movie) at hand. He spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and allegorical surreal, but they do not really seem to symbolize anything of interest. <br /> <br /> The most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint all their characters in a harsh vanilla tone. There are almost no distinguishable traits to help understand its purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his family quite normal, perhaps too normal) catalyze the "difficult situation" of the leading character, who is underdeveloped, never Focus. How are we supposed to identify with the rebellion of this young adult, with little sense of the world in which he lives or the prominent figures that surround him? <br /> <br /> Many people enter and leave the film (including Katja, Armin's girlfriend, and a strange and wealthy visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in seeing the protagonist eat brownies) and it seems that there are no There is no reason. Ultimately, they seem like just a prolonged filling of an already thin story with pointless secondary points that continue to show that the movie is running totally blank about where to go next. <br /> <br /> And even a movie that supposedly plays with reality (especially with Armin's nocturnal exploits), ends with a literal, almost moralizing scraper that seems to stop the questions of a "story" that makes little but puts the viewer in a state of uselessly exhausted perplexity. <br /> <br /> Without any color, it is impossible to shade something vital.
