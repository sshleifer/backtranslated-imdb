I do not leave IMDb's comments about movies, but this ... this movie was bad. very bad. I moved quickly through most of it, stopping where I expected the performance to have improved since the last scene, only to continue with the rapids forward. Formula of the plot: once the obvious killers were discounted, there was only one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as if I had read the script before because there were no surprises or mystery. The character Tori ... bad bad acting. A real waste of time on DVD and a definite option of "let's go to bed early" if it's the only thing on television. If you watch this movie, you will realize that you will never be able to recover the time you just lost.
