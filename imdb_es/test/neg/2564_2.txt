Well, some other people have commented that this is not an action movie, so I do not need to repeat that (although I did). This is not exactly a disappointment, in fact, sometimes it's nice to see an actor try something different. But, unfortunately, this is not one of those occasions. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: nonexistent. This movie lacks history almost as much as that of 'Showgirls'. Sure, they throw a couple of environmentalists, no, not even environmentalists, another thing, gossip here and there to please Seagal (since that's what he likes). This does not make a story, not even close. Now, the end ... Even among those who really liked this movie ... the end, you have to admit that it was too or very stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, so I understand that this was a direct movie to the video (at least in the states), but this is even too good for this one. This piece of garbage should have been cable only, in TBS or Starz (late at night).
