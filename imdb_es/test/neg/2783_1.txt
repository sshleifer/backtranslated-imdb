This is one of those movies that you see with a group of people. You will have the best time. It is really very bad, as Showgirls is bad, but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best combination of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. Everything that can be wrong that you can do for an entertaining night, has it here. The first is the line of the label is "a group of teenagers ..." These people are both "teenagers" like my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director does not have any sense of suspense or tension. The "teenagers" of 30 years are standing and the "monster" comes out and attacks, and this happens a lot throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense in this, neither surprise nor anything. It's more like when you were children pretending to be persecuted by monsters and inventing things as you went along. And when I use the word "monsters" I exaggerate. More like a couple of guys with Halloween masks bought at the .99 cents store. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script was split in a couple of days, it is not written again and I can only imagine how bad and bad format was on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur without any clue It is another example of one of the bad things of this day and age: anyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the best thing about this movie is acting. It's as bad as you can get. There is not a single person in this who has the slightest ability to act and the leader is the worst of all. He delivers each line in this monotonous manner without any expression and you must ask yourself how someone so bad could participate in any movie, no matter who you know. When he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie. Seeing these people recite some of the horrible dialogue is a lot of fun. But when the black man said "tell him ... tell him ... love her ..." before his death scene, there was a great laugh among our group. Fun and funny things <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this movie has ratings bad enough to take its place where it belongs: in the lowest IMDb rating, 100 movies. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it surprising that the only "great" comment that this movie received was from someone in Virginia (who has only one comment, only about this movie and nothing else)? And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the people who work on the film should NOT be allowed to comment.
