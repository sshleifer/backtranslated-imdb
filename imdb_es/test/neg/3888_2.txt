I was surprised to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it. I stayed until the end, but it was painful, especially having to listen to that child's voice. As Socact-1 commented, even though the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she did not have a Chicago accent. It seemed more like he was trying to imitate a New York accent, but he also failed at that. I was so confused that I was waiting for the auction. Of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child, why did they select this one? And why force her to talk like that? It was not just the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. The reason why I selected this movie was that the plot attracted me: this was in the story, the kind of characters that are poor and uneducated, the stage and the love triangle. As far as I'm concerned, it could have been and should have been much better. I was very relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same as I did about this movie.
