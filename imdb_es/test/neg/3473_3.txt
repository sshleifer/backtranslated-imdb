"Nero", since the title of the film is in Germany, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbo, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historical Nero than the funny but completely fictitious Nero Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" It is still a great failure. And for those commentators who still believe that the Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. Nero did not burn Rome, this is proven! He did not kill Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and mutilate for pleasure, he was the first emperor to FORBID the gladiatorial fights. The film still shows many mistakes, and by the way is made in a very cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looked like a villa, the city itself seemed ... well, like a cheap set. The performance was between good and low, music almost insignificant and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor in a hasty and poorly edited disaster without any clear narrative structure. So there is still the potential for an epic biography of Nero showing the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
