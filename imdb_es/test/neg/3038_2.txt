The original WASC is not, by any means, a movie to see in the genre. In fact, if it were not for the first 25 minutes, there would be no logical reason to see it. The new version takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85-minute Horror movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I have nothing against the horror films PG-13, but the tendency that surrounds them is to weaken. When you see the PG-13 classification, expect a movie full of false fears, teen t.v. or stars of music, and a plot that has been used several times. Do not even ask for gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know that it is not correct to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it is necessary to do so because the whole idea of ​​the new one is based on the principle of the original. The tension that is felt through the first movie is not present in any way in the remake. Not even with the incredible configuration or the great use of lightning. Without tension, suspense, emotion ... nothing. The movie goes too slow before it gets a little "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. The chase sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there is a feeling of "what happens next?". But that's it. The situations that are prepared for the climax are predictable, boring and lack suspense. The original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene in the film. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that this is a PG-13 horror movie but, if you respect the original. Why change is the most important situation? Children must not survive! After the end I felt that this movie did not make sense. So the nanny was playing cat and mouse with a madman ... is that all? So, the sequence in the hospital was stupid. And worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best of the movie. She offers a nice and credible performance. She needs to choose better projects, although this role will win her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please, do not watch this movie. Some people say that to support the genre Horror we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. It is not necessary to agree. If we ignore movies like WASC, then Horror movie producers will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, not boring movies full of false scares. <br /> <br /> See the original "When A Stranger Call" in place because the first 25 minutes are MUCH BETTER than the complete remake (nonsense).
