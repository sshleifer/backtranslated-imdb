Creating a comedy is like walking a very thin rope. It works, or it does not work. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have some very funny parts, but for most, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy of the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler's films (without Sandler himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 years old and is the best tester and gaming player in his place full of children. He ends up getting his apartment and his things taken away for not paying the bills (and it turns out that his roommate had just spent the rent money on the Filipino prostitutes and did not pay the owner). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and his two roommates. <br /> <br /> That's the basic plot of the movie, released with a secondary plot about a new girl named Samantha. (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma on Scooby Doo) trying to make testers complete a new game as fast as they can, a game similar to a robot that creates a prodigy JP (Joel Moore) that works with Alex and He wears the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix and, of course, all kinds of jokes related to sex and drugs. That is all. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the movie happens and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the movie, is that it's just not fun. It's totally boring, and just a little funny. Nothing really happens at all. No emotion, no real sense of direction and a whole ton of intense insults. You may find yourself laughing at a few funny jokes that the actors say, but otherwise you feel completely bored, wishing you had not even bothered with the movie. The way this movie lit up with green light and the way that Fox thought he could make money will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is simply no entertainment value. None of the actors are performing well, they just act like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner's comedy has been done several times and, at times, it actually works (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it only makes the movie even less fun than it already is. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts also does not make the film better. <br /> <br /> In addition to some funny phrases, this movie should be completely lost. It's not very funny, the whole plot is silly, it's boring and it only serves for a horrible movie. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
