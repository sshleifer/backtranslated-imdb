A piece of garbage, I would have given it a 0 if I could. The animation is good, but not enough. The story is absolutely the most ridiculous I've found, and that's saying a lot! This 'movie' tried to be interesting, but it failed miserably. It is almost as if the writer started a story, then had another idea and tried to unite the two. Do not waste your time on this; Believe me, you will be as happy with yourself as I was. The only actor of any note in this was James Woods, and his part was, at best, peripheral. I am in favor of doing things that are nervous, that push the envelopes, but this simply did not cut it.
