"The Secret Life" begins with the worst possible narrative introduction: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about ...". Well, then, what are you suggesting? That we should not bother to keep seeing that the film will not be exact or bloody, anyway? And they were right, too! The film is not at all shocking and contains almost no blood or blood. Although I think that this is mainly due to the low production values ​​of the budget and not because the crimes of Dahmer are too horrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just a sequence repeated over and over again. Jeffrey, young, sad and mentally confused, picks up victims (always men, since he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks that it was not his intention to hurt them and the only thing that is. This becomes boring really fast, and even the admirable performance of the unknown actor Carl Crew can not prevent this film from being a total failure. Still, this version is much better than the pretentious and confusing "Dahmer" that was launched in 2002.
