1980 was definitely a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. "Friday The 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best, but there were always a couple of mischievous things that were not as far away as "Do not Go Into The Woods Alone" and this one. But to be fair, "The Prey" is not as bad as "Do not Go Into The Woods", but it's not great either. One thing is that it is boring and the acting is not very good, but it is much better than "DGITW" and this movie actually has some attractive females to watch, the three protagonists were awesome. One thing is what happens with all those useless images of wildlife, it just seemed useless and it seemed that the director used them to use them to fill a little space of time. <br /> <br /> So, what was there to like? this movie? Well, there were some moments of loud laughter of cheese. I could not contain a fit of laughter when the final girl did a strange kind of moon walk backwards to get away from the kille and there were some good killing scenes. favorites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag; and the false aspect. <br /> <br /> In general, The Prey is dumb, boring and the killer did not scare me at all, this movie could have been much better.
