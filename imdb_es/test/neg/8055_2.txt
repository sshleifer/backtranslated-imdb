This movie has too many things happening. Another critic comments that the disconnected and episodic nature of the film reflects the director's memories: that's fine, if that's how it was written and performed. Instead, what we get is a direct narrative, in part, that jumps from one side to another, leaves us hanging in some cases, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other cases and, otherwise, simply does not work. <br /> <br /> There are also some details of the plot that simply do not work. For example, why drag a body to a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, instead of at night? Why leave your sheet flat on the body? Why would an artist who knew Joe's character for a short time decide to leave it "all" (even if it was not much)? This secondary plot was poorly developed to make that point work. In fact, why even make man an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and free nudity scenes? Could he have so easily been a photographer, or an opera composer? In fact, how does someone describe an apartment at an Opera, particularly without a clear connection to the Opera? The coincidences are also too obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Why would the boys take everything in the store and "disappear"? If Tim was a 10-year schoolmate in a city as small as Bangor, how could Joe lose track of him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough to recommend the other for a job? <br /> <br /> Some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend (s) and the sister who wants to escape felt like a filler.) There are some good ideas that could have made a feature with full development or could Having been interesting short films, once finished, this film did not make much sense and offers even less.
