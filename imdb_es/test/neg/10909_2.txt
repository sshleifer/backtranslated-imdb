Being a big fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/) I expected another French beach romance to captivate me with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. The same director, the same actress, what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a big disappointment. He is very slow and talkative, which would be fine if the dialogue conveyed information about the characters, whether significant or original. But it appears as a typical telenovela that alternates between irrelevant talks of pillows and jealous accusations. The only thing that prevents this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" with respect to Pauline. The source material is the standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation) but it could have been a decent movie, however, if any of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately that is not the case. Although there are other shortcomings in Rohmer's season cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one.
