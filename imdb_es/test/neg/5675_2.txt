I'm surprised that people can describe this teenage exercise as film noir. It is true that there is a gun and a bottle and a lady and the protagonist is a private eye, but that is not what makes the genre, friends. This works like an overheated program of television cops: many bloody punches and a terrible continuity, with a hint of memories of Chinatown. Pretty hard to see beyond the first 10 minutes. You want a contemporary touch, look at anything from John Dahl.
