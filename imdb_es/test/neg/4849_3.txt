This is the kind of film that makes you question your previous admiration for a particular director before you stop and remember that there are very few people whose body of work does not contain a few odds and ends. <br /> <br /> The casting in the films of Lelouch is of great importance because it puts the spectator in so much intimacy with the characters. The actors have to bring the magic of real screen to live the intensity. Otherwise, it is simply hollow. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, none of the actors in this movie had any of that screen magic. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell short as leaders. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong in this part. The adorable rogue did not fit his strengths. Your brand of charm also hit a false note for me here. The person of Iron has too much decay to fit into a love story of Lelouch. <br /> <br /> Although I would hesitate to miss any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would have worked better on this. paper. Many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the Americanism of the lyricist in particular that it seemed a bit discordant that Jeremy Irons interpreted the love interest, although logically it did not matter. He still fucked the flow of the movie in some way. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, I should have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would have brought the magic of the screen into swords. Brad Pitt could also have done a good job in delivering his particular combination of charm and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. When I read about her, I have learned that she has an enormously successful career as a singer and many fans, so, I do know, but her presence on the screen as a singer is very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than a singer in those scenes in which she had to perform and sell a song. Nothing I was singing touched me. She was nice but insipid. <br /> <br /> In contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and who only has a voice coach in French, would still have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all the amazing French talent that could have been taken advantage of. It was heartbreaking to see Patricia Kaas occupy space on the screen when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could have been chosen. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this movie that it really could not work without the music working. And since Kaas did so badly in this respect, the film never had the chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the fate of this film when he chose Patricia Kaas. JMO
