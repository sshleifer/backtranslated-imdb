I am a chess player and I wanted to like this movie. The problem is that the content could have been included in a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> There were many shots of runners walking down and Kasparov looked at the room where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov at the 1997 party site and he was told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was. This looked like a stuffing. <br /> <br /> Also, I did not find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and to see an IBM technician trying unsuccessfully to "open it". Anyway, what would we have seen of interest inside, a great little teacher? <br /> <br /> Also, the recent match against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. It would have been good if they told me: was this once 'just for money'? Was it part of the world championship cycle? what was the final result? The knot of the movie was the game in game two. Could / would IBM see Kasparov 'inside' the machine? That's where the focus should have been.
