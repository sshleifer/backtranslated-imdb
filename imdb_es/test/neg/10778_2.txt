Yawn, that's my reaction to this movie. I really hoped that this would have been a good modern slasher, but it does not even fall into the category of slashers. Instead, it tries to be something it is not, which is a psychological thriller, and fails so miserably in this. Even the title "Freak" suggests that this could be interesting. Match this with the cover on the DVD and think "OK, maybe I'll try." Not worth it. <br /> <br /> Actually, the story starts a little interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head chained by his fat mother. She screams at him and probably hits him, because in a scene we see her slapping him for no reason. After all this, he decides that he has had enough and breaks his face with (I think) a rock. Today, he is now in an asylum and is being transferred. On his way, he gets out of the van he is in and escapes. Present also the 2 main characters, a girl and her older sister. They are moving and they are on their way. So most of the movie is they're in the car talking to each other. But, the bandaged "Freak" is now loose and is about to explode into a grueling murder! (This is me being totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how boring that turned out to be this movie. The budget was the smallest ever, without any special effect, and the dialogue did not matter to me. This is one of those movies where packaging is better than the film itself. And to compare this with Halloween? Trash! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except the third), but Halloween is far superior to this. At least with Halloween we have a great score and some really spooky moments. With this, there is practically no music, except a piano here and there, and there is nothing spooky in this movie. Maybe this movie would have gone better if it had a solid score because even the worst of the movies is tolerable if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion about the movie. I thought it was just a full waist of time and money. But, since the movie has a rating of more than 4/10 in IMDb, there must be people who like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
