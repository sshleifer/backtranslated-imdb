I agree with a commenter who says it's really impossible to check Glen or Glenda. objectively. If one does, the film by its merits would have to be qualified as quite terrible, given the hilarious and convoluted dialogue, the generally mediocre action to poor of the cast, as well as the zero production values. However, such an evaluation does not capture the absolutely fascinating experience of watching this movie as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestism and that it was a controversial lifestyle in the 1950s. It is not even the tolerance petition of people who adopt alternative life choices that fascinates, except as a historical relic. <br /> <br /> No, what does Glen or Glenda do? Still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood left his psyche uncovered in a way that so-called author directors like Hitchcock or Godard, despite their very superior talents, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicting feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance throughout the film. In fact, the film's conclusion suggests that Ed Wood's character in Glen may "kill" his female Glenda counterpart by transferring Glen's feelings of love and affection for his female counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that as Glen makes that psychic transfer, Glenda will disappear. So, while Wood could advocate the tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure of wanting it for himself. <br /> <br /> In addition, Wood was not afraid to throw away everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. He did it with whatever archival material he could get his hands on. If it does not match, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda was especially Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I want to add to my previous comment is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. The strangely memetic effect that the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities, I think it can not be qualified.
