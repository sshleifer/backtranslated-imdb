At first glance, I must say already, see The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action film with a more dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The Trigger has a horrible plot that focuses on some kind of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with a horrible direction for an action movie: no emotion moments and an action movie becomes boredom. <br /> <br /> Actually, what do you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when he is offered horrible scripts like this one? Do not blame him, he needs the money. <br /> <br /> This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago. But I will not see it again, in any way. Screwing. It stinks there. I said. <br /> <br /> PS: I do not think I said "this movie sucks" in an IMDb review. Thanks, detonator!
