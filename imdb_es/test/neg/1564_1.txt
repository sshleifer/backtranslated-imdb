Cultural Vandalism Is Hallmark's new production of Gulliver's Travels an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, a single copy of the book is not burned. But if this is the only people in Gulliver who are exposed, and for many, those people will not get anything like what Jonathan Swift intended. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for violations of moral rights and they would lose. That's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, shitty and ... human. The small people in Lilleput are small in every way. Small and stupid, they fight, big and small, the endless wars of annihilation on which the ends of their watery eggs open on the breakfast table. It sounds a little like us. <br /> <br /> I forgot most of the rest: I have not read it for years. The television program reminded me of some things and, on the positive side, it made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift for mankind has been screwed up, like Gulligan under the branches under the vulgar Yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be completely embarrassed. Some "creative people" had the brilliant idea of ​​putting the focus on "the star:" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose performance is simply bad. He portrays Gulliver as crazy. All his trips were invented. Weeeeel Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift invented Gulliver! Naturally, the lands he visited were imaginary: that is called fiction. His purpose was to talk about humanity and our relationships, often terrible, among us. The travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat the imagination as a disease and anyone who has a time when Hallmark can not become one of his bland letters is suspect. <br /> <br /> I can see why Hallmark would produce this shit. It's so bad that O'Toole, always profound, seems as small as his Lilliputian character. It is in the character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many, if not all, of the great actors do. Informing the character sheds light on him. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do it in a very subtle way, like Hopkins in "The Remains of the Day." Others, like Nicholson, in most things in the last twenty years, have two fairly separate parts. Nicholson actually plays with the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him everything is the cradle of the cat and he, laughing, holds all the ropes. Very funny, as is O'Toole. But here something is missing. He is shouting in a megaphone (as good as ever) and all the senses are a hollow shell beneath him. <br /> <br /> That's because it is. Look for "anodyne" and the word "Hallmark" should appear as a synonym. Harmless, insipid, harmless: Hallmark is the doll that can not urinate because it has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person without distinction. Hallmark's hallmark is to have no stamp. I never suspected that these people despise so much those who have imagination. Suddenly, "Disney against the meta-physical" of Pound is highlighted in bold. Or Einstein's "Men of genius will always be violently opposed by mediocre minds." In fact, anyone, this mediocre guy, who has an answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is suspicious. Who is more distinctive than a man who travels to the darkest places of the human soul and lights his little lantern to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians, the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians, the great statues of the classical era and these things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture; the one that feeds them and sustains them. And we. <br /> <br /> Buy a copy of Gulliver's Travels where you live, and read it. Or ask for it online. I like to use the ABE books.
