The story of a man's love for an innocent baby that meets a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world is a self-centered "girl of the valley" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of them. There live what a great and worthy argument. But by saying this, the writing and / or the direction and / or editing of the screen is so deficient as to get most of the joy out of the story. The character of Linda Hamilton goes from understanding Mom to the evil witch and returns faster than an accelerated bullet, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, to the drop of a hat. Katie (the girl from California) and her boyfriend, Katie's mom and everyone, including the poor lady at the airport check-in desk, Lin's adoptive father, who is the kindest and most thoughtful man in the world, and his wife and his biological son, all in constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a moving story, but the only thing that made me SMILE was when all the hatred and the fight were over. There were too many unexplainable or illogical events, many of which do not contribute to the story. My wife and I kept looking at each other and wondering how such a good cast and what a great story should be, could be so trapped.
