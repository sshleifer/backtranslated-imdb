Unfortunately, House of D is simply horrible, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre performance and, in fact, almost everything else is below average. <br /> <br /> Tom flees from New York to survive in some way as a lonely child in Paris, and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian girl that he eventually marries him, who is French, despite a little command of their language. She is surprised when years later he reveals his "secret" to her. Riiiight! <br /> <br /> He then "gives" his pain story to his own son, and we are expected to believe that it is the best birthday gift a father can give to his 13-year-old son. I wish those things were so easy! David Duchovny misinterprets his own wife Tea Leoni in the role of his mother and cross out again. Leoni makes me laugh like a comic, but she is simply wrong with this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems you do not agree with is that none of the characters is sympathetic. I just did not care what happened to any of them. I expected Robin Williams and his "child in the body of an adult" brand to fall into a bump in the Village, but, unfortunately, it did not happen and we had to endure his simpering performance all the way. <Br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin and William's daughter, Zelda, were not bad, but I suspect that the favorable comments others are giving them is simply because they were not as bad as the others in this movie. They were not great, let me put it this way. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many silly and artificial aspects: Erykah Badu, the bicycle, the Catholic school and its idiot staff, the conveniently stupid characters, etc., that this review would continue forever, so I will finish saying that House of D is a very bad movie, and I'm almost embarrassed by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really bothers me is how online "friends" encouraged me to see this so I traveled a long way to do it. <br /> <br /> It would not have bothered me so much that this movie would be so bad if I had lost a couple of hours at the local cinema, but instead, I lost a whole day and discovered that my supposed "friends" are stupid or dishonest, because this is a horrible movie!
