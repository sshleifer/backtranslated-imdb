The forbidden movie of Nico Mastorakis was quite disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple, who goes to a Greek island to kill all perverted people (apparently). You know you have something pretty sick when one of the first scenes includes a guy who has sex with a goat and then kills him. <br /> <br /> But things only get worse from that point on, as all the scenes are very similar. . They meet with some people, so they kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The end is fine, it's fine when the couple becomes brother and sister and she's just allowing it to rot somewhere. But in general one would have expected more. I do not have substance here, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
