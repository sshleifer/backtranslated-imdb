I've seen worse things, which is a way of saying in advance how bad this movie was. The plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage? In a New York school with smoke and low light, and somehow this clich√© hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? Seriously? Does a day-long hostage situation, with a wounded officer of the NYPD, take all day? I realize that this movie was made before 9/11, but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could drag this exaggerated plot for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performance was mediocre at best, and the characters were apparently designed for the 7th. graduates The abused child, the frightened pregnant girl, the violent aspiring gang, an unfortunate and confused victim, the white man who makes cruel judgments. Please. <br /> <br /> Trying to turn this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please, this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a boy who shoots a policeman. They are confused, they are ignorant idiots who get involved in a silly and implausible situation. Do not try to paint them, suddenly, as nobles. The one who laughs the most is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and admires Michelangelo so much that he paints these amazing scenes on the walls. You got to be kidding. <br /> <br /> Are the signs of "no racism" in the protesting crowd? A black boy shoots a black policeman and a black negotiator tries to fix everything. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the general message, which was misinterpreted, although some actors who have followed respectable careers. <br /> <br /> This was a joke. The red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was the boy, with fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his friend on the roof, "promise me," etc. So original. <br /> <br /> The epilogue of "I went to jail but now I am in the pre-law of XYZ University" ... an appropriate way to end a joke in a movie.
