* Spoilers in this document * <br /> <br /> Where do I start with how silly this movie was? 'Mole-sized people, living under the garden attacking residents of a large house' !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I did not know that the protagonists were not poltergeists, etc., but 10-inch-tall goblins that seemed very easy to kick. I kept watching it because I like watching movies until the end, even horrible. this movie was terrible My girlfriend, who went to sleep within the first ten minutes, apart from finding a good help to sleep, I thought it was very funny that I had bothered to see everything. <br /> <br /> Little goblins even in large numbers (the thought is silly, I know, they are as scary and threatening as the flat tail.) They only managed to make a man 'fatally' fall and kill a cat before They exploded, The End. I mentioned it sucked, right?
