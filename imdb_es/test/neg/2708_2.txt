A film that breaks the ears, a set of balls of screwdriver almost ancient designed to show the comedic attributes of the singer Madonna. She really moves away from the proverbial member here by playing a parolee beyond vivacity who tries to prove that she was the victim of a murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she turned on a red light ... laughs) After an energetic sequence of animated credits, which is much more fun than the rest of the image, we have nothing to do except the black mascara and red lips of Madonna marked by her platinum hair and her pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated playing Maddy's guardian, while the cast of bad choice is struggling to laugh with a lousy dialogue. It's an unfortunate mishap for the talents of director James Foley, who recklessly allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the thriller movies of the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side) . Unhappy. * since ****
