As a South African, living in South Africa again after a 32-year stay in the UK, I am sorry to say that this film is a big disappointment. The three main problems I had with the film were a) why Swank and Ejiofor, an American and a Nigerian, are the protagonists. This country is full of talent and has no need for imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has been exchanging her Lucha credentials for years. She is a very mediocre writer and even her novel does not support Mr. Hooper's flaccid address ... and c) Hilary Swank again, such a great actor, as shown by Million Dollar Baby (but it's also Eastwood), here dressed in style contemporary of New York while freely traveling the poverty of Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity that the client and the director needed? Yes, the movie is finally moving, how could it not be? - but the general state of mind in the conclusion is one of tremendous disappointment. The heart is in the right place, but it needs a pacemaker.
