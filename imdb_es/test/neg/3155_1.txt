Barney and his friends ... the Dora explorer of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Ok, I admit it. When I was a boy, Barney was my ultimate hero. I had my stuffed Barney and I used to watch the same Barney episodes over and over again on a videotape. Maybe because he was so covered in sugar and amazing. <br /> <br /> However, when I turned 7, I started to hate Barney. Everyone in the school would do Dis Barney, and I accepted it (mainly because it was fun) and that's what little children do. But a few years later, I discovered something more about Barney that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> A person known at the IMDb as Angel_meiru did an Essay for the school, explaining the dangers of seeing Barney, and he or she posted it on the forums. Many of those dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that can magically come alive during a day at school. supposedly it's educational, or so Sheryl Leach says (Creator of Barney), but really, all I can remember of what she taught me, is that magic can solve anything, which is not true. <br /> <br /> to finish with this Comment, I would like to tell you a little story. There was once a child who saw a particular episode of Barney. One day, he was alone, when a stranger took him to his car and left with him. I do not know the result (but it is safe to assume that the child died), but why was he kidnapped in the first place? because he saw the episode of Barney and his friends entitled "A stranger is a friend you do not know yet". <br /> <br /> 0/10
