The premise of this film seems to be that the passage of the generation of the Second World War in America, with its falseness of apple pie and its hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. Those horrible hippies ruined everything apparently. <br /> <br /> What keeps the film together are the excellent performances, especially Lemmon, which is truly remarkable. Otherwise, we have a boring life drama (with more than 24 hours of Jack's life) with pretensions. <br /> <br /> I found it a difficult task to sit down.
