Well, now that all the friends and relatives of the director / production company have posted their short reviews after seeing this at various festivals, I think it's time to show the reviews written by people who actually paid $ 10 to see it. <br /> <br /> Like "Dear Jesse" (the only other one of his films I've seen) of the director, "Loggerheads" suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas in an indie budget. I swear, this guy could have better luck doing miniseries. I kept waiting for the various threads of the plot to come together, but they only intercepted in points blatantly so that they would be shown in an obvious way for everyone, except for the more dense viewer. It was like watching a season of Lifetime films made for television grouped in a long sketch (I said in my opinion LOOONG) in the old show "Carol Burnett". Maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim: "Hey ... remember all the girl movies we went to last year ... the one of the adoptive mother ... the boy's gay ... that of the Christian housewife, we went to THREE chicks last year, so now we have to go see Terminator 4. I guess you have to do something for a well-known actor to raise funds, but What is Bonnie Hunt doing in this film? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this "performance" attempt will not send Mr. Oscar to her door, I mean (speaking of Lifetime Original Movies), were not Valerie available? Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett? Mrs. Hunt has always seemed cold to me, maybe I should have played with the other mom? I wish I had chosen "Capote" to complete my weekly Gay Indie Permission ... well, maybe next week. I think there's a good reason why Capote is playing in a lot of theaters throughout the area of ​​the City of New York and this is playing into one; Let distributors trust this movie to run in the opposite direction if they do not trust this review!
