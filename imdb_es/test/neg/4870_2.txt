This movie is full of so many idiotic moments that one wonders how it was done. For example, they enter the sewers of the Capitol and while they are in the sewers, you can see signs that point to several government buildings, and then they go up in the middle of the street! I very much doubt that government buildings provide public access through the city's sewer system. Anyway, I gave this one a 2 instead of a 1 just for its comic value. I laughed all the way through the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie.
