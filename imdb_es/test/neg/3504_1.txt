I wrote this as a two-part review. The second part has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, this is not the sex of car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, in which everyone is racist, and race is the subject on everyone's mind at all times. Race. <br /> <br /> It's like the movie has a form of turret syndrome where race is the constant theme. Career. Racist. Racism. Race relations Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film that took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnection of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a mental vomit of 1'53 ". in the US RACE In the 24-hour period, we have 7 parallel stories related to race The first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an effort to be realistic about racism in the United States. < For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief, too bad, the first half of its story rises directly from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction, RACISM, its section is the Quentin section Tarantino where Instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism CONSTANTLY. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about this is Mexican history when the Mexican man is talking with his daughter. It gives its invisible impenetrable layer to protect it from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say instead. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act in any appearance of realism. The scene in which he is trying to fix the lock and the Mexican says he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would someone act like this? Is it realistic? NOOO It reminds me more of the employee of the convenience store of The Doom Generation. "Six dollars sixty-six cents feminine." If I ever see the second half of the movie, I hope they take off his head and that his disembodied head starts to vomit. <br /> <br /> I have not mentioned the race in more than one paragraph. CAREER. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Best. Then there is the black man who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe, who looks beautiful and does nothing, and several other bad actors who act badly with bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon sexually harasses the wife of the black producers, could I help him if he were laughing at me? When Philippe is guessing for the second time that he writes about his racist for his racism, can I help him? The movie is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST I tell him. <br /> <br /> Now, notice, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, plus a nod to Matt Dillon, who actually tried to do a decent job. work. Who was paid for that, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> I do not see it unless you want to be preached about racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script of 2 white men over 50 years old. They have no appearance of reality or interaction with the real society in any way or form. <br /> <br /> D- <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes each and every one of the story lines in the first half. .. and throws them again in a kind of redemption, conclusion, the world is a great coincidence. And, in fact, it is one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Take the Magnolia from 1999. People were not conveniently tied again and again. They just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something in which you knew that someone else was also involved. Crash takes this wrap to a serious extreme. <br /> <br /> The stories are aligned so everyone can meet again. Is there only 5 in the LAPD force? Are not these people working strange shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift and then an early one the next day? And why did Tate have to be the killed hitchhiker? Would not I have had more emotional tension and also realism, if it had been someone we had not been following all day? Like Phillippe, he just picks up a hitchhiker at random and then gets scared. Everyone would go crazy. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the second half, the scene of the invisible and moving layer is used to make the Hindi shoot the daughter. It made me angry and it made me feel dirty. It is not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then made it the direct cause of people tearing themselves apart. It really pissed me off. In the writers, not in the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally out of place. The coincidences are too many and require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which was slightly connected, this had connections over connections over connections that were so exaggerated. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. Although she does not die. She should have. I was glad when he fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is that it attracts Magnolia. Not only in the structure, but has a montage on the song In the Deep where you see everyone depressed. Magnolia took this and had a postmodern comment to have all the characters singing along with Wise Up by Aimee Mann. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash did it in 2005. It is difficult to comment on a film that will not be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> A total loss of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: the lowest degree ever; In general: F ---
