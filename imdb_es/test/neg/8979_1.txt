This is by far the worst British comedy of all time, how he overcame the first episode and much less that the pilot surpasses me. The acting is weak from the main character played by Ben Miller to Sarah Alexander (for the fantastic coupling) through the cast. The plot / story lines were fun and very predictable using many worn-out ideas. A very painful series to endure but sadly placed in a place between two excellent shows. describing it as Britain's response to "Knowing the parents" hurts "knowing the parents" and is as recent as an old shoe that runs with the family dog. Britain should have learned that the scams of other countries never work to see the sad attempts of the United States to do so.
