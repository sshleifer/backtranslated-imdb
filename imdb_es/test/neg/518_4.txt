"Submerged" is definitely NOT "the worst movie in history". It has its flaws, like borrowed images, crazy scripts and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some positive points. The acting is surprisingly good, there are MANY familiar faces that you'll probably know if you're a fan of serial movies like me. <br /> <br /> I was so happy to see Brent Huff play one of the heroes, knowing him mainly for his 80s action films, and I must admit he's not a bad actor. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson have a limited screen time, but they are credible in their parts. The "candies for the eyes" in this film by Fred Olen Ray are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both very attractive and very bad. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background like a Navy Seal. Unfortunately, the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He does not act at all, he talks as if he had not even read the script, and being a moody at the beginning of the movie, he gets slapped an hour later. It is not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, this is not a bad choice for nightly entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound in anyone), the annoying performance of Coolio and the recycled images of Airport 77, you may like this obviousness after all.
