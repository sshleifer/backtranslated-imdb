I thought that this movie was going to be good. Absolutely it was not, despite the main Oscar-winning actors. I may have laughed once, and I never heard anyone laugh in the theater. The pancake makeup of Renee Zellweger was very improper. Everyone seems to be struggling so much in this movie, running in imitation of slapstick but without achieving it. I think maybe the movie should have sounded good in development, but something was lost in the translation. Were the roaring 20 really like that? I do not think so. Everything seems a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, just like any other film that takes place in the 20s or 30s. There is simply not so much originality here.
