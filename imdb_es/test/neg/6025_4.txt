As the characters start with "Unknown" identities, they do not identify themselves by name, so you start with the handsome James Caviezel who wakes up in a warehouse. He discovers that the place is locked. Do not ask, the windows are made with safety glass and it is impossible to go out. Four other men of the awakening make him a quintet: Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as "Bound Man", and Jeremy Sisto Shot and "Man Handcuffed". Oh man ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers and two are victims, but they do not know who is who or who is who. Oblivion is due to a leak in the pipe. Do not ask, it happens. Meanwhile, on the outside, law chief David Selby (as Parker) sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's wives, Bridget Moynahan (as Eliza Coles), frantically waits. But the leader of the criminal element gang, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots," is also on the way to the scene. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis of the DVD says, "As secrets are revealed and clues unraveled, men must compete against time to discover who is good and who is bad to stay alive." This story reads much better than it seems in a movie, unfortunately. When the secrets finally reveal themselves and the memories become clear, there is no longer much interest in what has happened. Simply, the director Simon Brand has a great premise with the idea of ​​Matthew Waynee, but they tax a small investment in the characters that hold the short end of the stick. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/01/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
