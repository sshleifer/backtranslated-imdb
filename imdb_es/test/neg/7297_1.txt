Are you looking for a movie for your Turkish Film Festival? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The plot, the story of an apocalyptic post duck samurai warrior, is a convoluted whirlwind of cinematic references to everything from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI. The performance fluctuates from insipid to abysmal. The scene in which the villain tempts the old master is shameful to the point of mocking laughter. The Black Knight of Frank Stalone reminds him too much of the Black Knight of John Cleese in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRIL. (Word of Advice, Frank: When you lean over to make a movie like this, your career is over.) I stumbled upon this stinky little bomb on a low-end cable channel and could not stop seeing. It's like watching a train crash, you just can not look the other way.
