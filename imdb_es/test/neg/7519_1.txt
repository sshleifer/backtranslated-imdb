If you loved the "The Time Machine" version of the early 60s, do not waste time; Like last year with "Planet of the Apes", this has been "reinvented", and not for the better. And, as with "Planet ...", its main actor is woefully misinformed and leader; Guy Pearce, an excellent actor of great rank, is totally wrong for this role, giving an interpretation of a single note that causes zero sympathy; He is so severe and serious, and he lacks admiration for the (supposedly) amazing things that he sees that you do not believe for a moment that he is experiencing them. Worse yet, whose idea was it to resemble the loving son of David Spade and Calista Flockhart? A handsome actor, here is sickly, what is, believe it or not, a great distraction. Frankly, the man is seriously ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is not synchronized with anyone else's. Unfortunately, even with a suitable protagonist, this film has no chance, since it is loaded with a totally inept director: the whole scenes do not go anywhere and are poorly made, and an absolutely inferior script, scattered and, sometimes, incoherent. - not for a single moment you care about someone in this movie, just because there is NOTHING in the development of the character. In the original, you came to KNOW the Eloi, therefore, you felt for them and felt their terror of the Morelocks; Here, as the film emphasizes several times, they are just sheep and act accordingly. Unless you are a PETA member, scared sheep are HARDLY entertaining things! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does her best, in her film debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of the Morelocks [who seem rejected from "The Mummy Returns "], why, then, do you see yourself as the lost brother of Edgar Winter?) He is completely lost. Also wasted the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $ 70 million spent on the film; They are uniformly dull, obvious and unconvincing. And then there is the aspect of the film: badly photographed, his artistic direction and his sets are "there" and his costumes are typical in design. There is no original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. More than anything, it's not even fun! (The filmmakers use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comic relief" but, as usual, Jones is irritating, and HOW does his electric character survive in a seemingly powerless world?) <br /> <br /> In short, this is an empty matter, lifeless, boring, sterile and confused: DID NOT YOU ALREADY REMOVE "Planet of the Apes"? (At least ESA had the fortune of some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The final insult (beyond a terribly terrible tremor, not to mention the convenient ending)? Not only are they characterized by changing clothing figures, but they also make the time machine itself an anachronistic and eye-catching hole in glass and chrome! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, THIS is exactly what it would look like.) Pathetic ...
