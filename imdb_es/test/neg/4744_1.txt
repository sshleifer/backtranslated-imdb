Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take the franchises x2 * Paralea for 5 minutes * Add mixed cardboard characters (the actors do not work better) * Add 2 tons of clichés and then bake in the microwave of your hole until that gets bored * Serve with a dash of Dawson's crack (not a typo) <br /> <br /> Voilá! - Money spinning Brain Rot for the Emo / World of Warcraft Generation <br /> <br /> Finding the keys in the drain was the best part (?) <br /> <br /> Apart from the first 5 minutes, it is One of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Total, absolute, meaningless.
