The third of the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) who becomes vigilant to take revenge on the thugs who murdered his old friend. I do not know why this movie pushed me to do it, but somehow it did. I found myself encouraging Bronson to clean the floor with those punks. Every time I blew one of them I felt good. This movie is not taken seriously, but what if it did? There is a good preparation for the end of fireworks in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But when it comes to acting and plot, it just does not measure up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would leave as fast as I could, but it seems that people are looking for trouble. I know there is a mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here, friends. I had to give him a 4. Of course there are good scenes of "flying" them, but that's it. At that time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure if those thugs really wished they could have something with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This movie gives you a feeling of joy. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To summarize, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it's pretty good if you're only looking for an hour and a half of shooting.
