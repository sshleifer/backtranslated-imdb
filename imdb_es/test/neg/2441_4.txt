A British movie for teenagers that focuses around a girl (Justine) accidentally creating her dreamed man (Jake) by using a virtual reality machine, there is only one problem (well, not just one?), She remains trapped inside your body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person you can trust. It sounds a lot worse than it is, it seemed more visible to me for the reason that Laura Fraser starred in it rather than the content of the film, in fact, it looks impressive, especially when dressed in a red lycra dress to impress to Jake. WOW !!, if only I had a virtual reality machine ??????
