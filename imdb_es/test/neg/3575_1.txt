I really enjoyed "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised to see that after the years, Suzanne Somers became the co-star of the show. But that was the only positive aspect of the program: the whole study, the introduction, the hosts, everything that gives a new meaning to the word "pompous". <br /> <br /> Well, that would be fine if the materials were not so good * I mean, come on, the best thing you can do is show a few men who have trouble taking the ketchup out of the bottle, Suzanne Somers walking with a basket of Halloween in July, place of ice cream that sells only vanilla ...? I have seen few episodes and each time it was horrible. They were posing as if it were the best show in history and then they fill the time with scenes so boring that I really felt ashamed to see. Even the people in them seemed bored and that just can not be good.
