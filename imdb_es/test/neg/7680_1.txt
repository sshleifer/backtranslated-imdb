There are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there is a body of minuscule and rare movies that are so terribly bad that, even after seeing them only once, the terrible perversity makes it impossible to forget them even decades later. This is exactly a movie of this kind, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was quite good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the mechanic of the "tough guy" who chews cigars has been promoted to airline captain, and, after the Concorde suffers a missile attack (do not ask), he resorts to tricks such as firing a flare gun . out of the cockpit window, despite (presumably) flying at Mach 2, while performing the high-G evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real plane, no matter the effect of the passengers! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least for fans of dedicated airplanes like me, is that this atrocity "starred" one of the most incredible, sexy and technologically most remarkable aircraft of all time. The Concorde (or, simply, the "Concorde" as its pilots call it) deserved much better, this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting her in a sequel to "Porky's". Fortunately, the launch of the always fun "Plane!" the following year it took to all the franchise of the "Airport" to a deserved cessation, since anyone that contemplated a fifth delivery would have been laughed until the death by the studies and the fanatics of the cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/10
