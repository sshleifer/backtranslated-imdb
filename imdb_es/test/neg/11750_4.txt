The most disposable movie in the history of cinema? This is a strong contender! Why spend so much money on such useless useless work? The only difference between the classic Htchcock and this bad imitation is the color, the wide screen and Leila's Walkman. A film that supposedly generates emotion and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you are going to say it, I will urge the younger generations to see the original? balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something different, for example, by choosing an actor closer to Bloch 'Bates, an obese man. They content themselves with a repugnant disgusting! A smallpox! And live Alfred Hitchcock!
