This is a strong recommendation for anyone who reads this review that has never seen the movie Total Reality, do not waste time and money when renting this poor excuse for a movie. This is, without equal, the worst movie I've seen in my life. I had nightmares about this movie since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur filmmaker could make a more decent movie. The film blatantly starts sci-fi films far superior, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (which seems to have derived the title). I'm sorry, but I think there's more entertainment value when you look at the side of a cardboard box for two hours. If you've seen this movie before, I feel sorry for you for going through what I did.
