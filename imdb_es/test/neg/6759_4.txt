First of all, Katherine Hepburn is as bad as Clara. She simply can not be convincing as the devout, disinterested and rather elegant wife that the writers have created. <br /> <br /> But the real weakness of the film is its superficiality in the face of a potentially great drama. Schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder is equivalent to "Oh, oh, I have a headache" and the occasional word of anger. Suicide?
