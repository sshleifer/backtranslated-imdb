Okay, I had seen this movie when I was very small and the day we were cleaning the closet, I see this! I thought: "I have no idea what this movie was like," so I went ahead and put it on. OH MY GOD! This movie is so bad! I never thought that this movie could get as close to my less favorite movie as it did, but I laughed, because all the jokes were so cheesy and ridiculous. , it's not funny. So many things in this movie were funny, because they were SO STUPID. This movie is not so good. I should say that if you want to see this movie it is better that you do not expect something big and if you have already seen it, trust me, I also feel your pain !!!!
