I must say that I was surprised to find several positive comments about this turkey (which desperately needs a feather transplant)! I give it a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a film about the wild man of rock and roll, Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to get so much garbage and the "killer" does not. Deserve this! It's good that he was late in his career ... they said that Elvis practically ruined his career with the films he released during the sixties and this could have done the same for Jerry Lee, if he had left 15-20 years earlier! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis's book and, to begin with, it's a shame. It's a bad and inaccurate story of his life together with Lewis and there are much better books about Killer, which could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a group of actors who do not know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a bit of both! Otherwise, the excellent actor Dennis Quaid is putting on one of the worst performances of an actor on many moons. He is walking in the picture, talking about his "God given talent" and as a spectator, you wish he would also show it on the screen! Silly gestures and funny faces, and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this really horrible movie. The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except for Winona Ryder, who does everything possible with the bad lines that have given him. It's "Grease" again and every time Jerry Lee strolls through Memphis in his convertible, with the radio on in the car, the whole city dances to the beat of the music! Everyone in this movie is like cartoon characters of real people involved ... from wild man to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a damn shame! An interesting and charismatic artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he got from the deal and told the company to get fucked ... twice!
