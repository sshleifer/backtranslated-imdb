This was the worst movie I've ever seen! My husband and I have over 600 DVDs, most of which are sci-fi and B-horror movies, which are not of the best quality, but are entertaining. Dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities! The writing was horrible, and the acting was even worse. It took 3 attempts to get through the whole movie, because we could only tolerate it at 30-minute intervals. We thought that surely it had to improve ... we were wrong. I'd rather see a corpse being embalmed than having to sit through it again !!! When I finished, my husband and I looked at each other like "Uh ... is that it?" The ending looked like it was supposed to be over, but they went over their apparent budget of $ 500.00 and said, "Oh shit ... we're broke ... send it now ... fast ... roll credits! "
