How bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There is the forced action, the atrocious dialogue, the half-baked plot and as its companion piece too much in the way in which the animals were slaughtered on the screen. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a direct movie. It does not pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some way, this helps production, since the film is very sharp and sharp compared to the grain of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, once again we are given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they get on themselves. There really is nothing in this movie that makes it worthwhile. I was quite lenient with my revision of the Holocaust due to a real attempt to make a statement and style, but in the case of Ferox there is no reason to see this unless you just put on blood and blood.
