Danny De Vito shows us that here he is, definitely, infinitely, a better actor on the screen than he was. He plays the role of Owen, a miserable aspiring writer with an old cranky mother (delightfully played by Anne Ramsey) who would like to see her dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has a estranged wife for whom he feels the same. So Owen, after watching Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train," suggests they swap murders. <br /> <br /> As a director, De Vito's control is inconsistent, as he wastes this clever idea, while his movie wobbles from the very humorous. to the very bland He and Crystal are well in the lead roles, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the singer of Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
