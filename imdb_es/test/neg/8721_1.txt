The Dune miniseries opens with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. The idea quickly realizes that these are the * best * scenes of the 265 minutes, and they are not good. It is not good at all. Oh darling. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book by its cover (although that is exactly what we are invited to do). Let us give Dune the opportunity to redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Well, here is the expected water opening in Caladan. But who is this petulant man, strangely ugly? Paul daring? * This * is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic puppet? And why does he look so old? What is that? Is the actor only 25? Well, he does not * look * him, and that's too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Incorrect. Alec Newman is a buffoon who stumbles and mutters. I'm imagining that they discovered him sitting in the dark in a recovery acting class because no one liked him enough to tell him that the class was over, and he's too stupid to notice. When his Paul Atreides has all the presence on screen of soaked toast, and a range of performance from "petulant" to "blank", his production of Dune is doomed from the start. Alec however, and gives performances uniformly insipid and incomprehensible so that it does not look so bad in comparison. At least, I guess that's what they're doing. Because I'm charitable, you see. <br /> <br /> To be fair, clearly no address is given. Random gestures, blank or inconsistent deliveries, losing their marks, everything is here. This is like a master class on how not to do it. <br /> <br /> And of course, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than in the 1984 movie, but there is not twice as many, because of all the. Make a break Fill. Weather. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $ 20 million, or only $ 5 million per hour. You could not expect anyone to do quality science fiction in that kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps "Stargate SG-1", which is satisfied with $ 1.4 million per episode of 50 minutes, or "Farscape" with $ 2 million. And, frankly, I prefer to watch four episodes of either of these while being hit in the kidneys, instead of sitting down to the parody of Dune, the miniseries again.
