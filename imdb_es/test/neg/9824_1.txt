We are looking for this hard to find VHS after seeing two excellent photographs of Merchant-Ivory back to back. Knowing that it was an instant failure of the box office, a failure like a rental, I thought it would be worth it to see it anyway based on the reputation of M-I. Too! Nine years ago, the objective of the Liberal Agenda was to a great extent to destroy the Founding Fathers and, in fact, had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers of many American classrooms, such as, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders ended quickly when the Washington Times highlighted the truth in the NJ School Board and its subversive action. A small part of this was heading the supposed connection Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson, without taking into account the inconvenient DNA findings that did not support the agenda of the crazy left. No matter! They got James Ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the turn of the Liberal Agenda begins in the opening scene in which James Earl Jones claims to be Jefferson's son. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes that the lie is true, Hemmings' assertion would be an insignificant detail in the broader issue of Jefferson's vital and protracted diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands, where he obtained a crucial financial support for the United States). when our little nation was without funds). <br /> <br /> In addition to the Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing more of interest in this monotonous and torturously boring movie. Part of the other story is really accurate: it adds credibility to frame the lie, but this film takes one of the most interesting moments in the history of the United States and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please, do not ask me why the liberals set out to destroy the Founding Fathers, because I do not waste time explaining the acts of such people. Do not ask them either; Usually, they answer these questions with the same answer: "SHUT OFF!"
