People do not seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same kind of people who watch a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, navigate through a shitty office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top fun? Of course, no. Was this movie something special? Of course, no. It was a silly movie and everyone assumed they were simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Films like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and almost any movie that Pauly Shore has been on are not meant to be taken seriously, and because of this, they really should not be considered some of the worst movies never made. . You can watch them waiting for a silly movie that is hilariously bad or that you are about six years old and you really think that Carrot Top is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Please, people if you already know that Carrot Top is late and you want to see a serious movie and bother writing a serious review ... do not look at this. Choosing this movie is like choosing a 5-year-old boy for not knowing the alphabet.
