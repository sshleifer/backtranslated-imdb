Directly to the video and with good reason. It's like neighborhood kids doing a play in the backyard, but worse. A young man, (Don Digiulio) inherits a farm in West Virginia that has been inactive for generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This farmland used to produce good corn crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret was that the owner was murdering people and watering the fields with his blood. Then they hang their bodies like scarecrows. The special effects are pretty boring and the horrible dialogue is full of extravagant phrases and the joke is so ridiculous that it is better to turn off the sound. Cheap gore and a farce from a horror movie. Along with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
