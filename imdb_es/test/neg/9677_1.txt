How this movie could be classified as a Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses merged in Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, appears thousands of years before he was born. The Canaanites roamed the earth ... really? What were the writers thinking? Was it only out of ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and the animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all those things from the Sunday School") or were trying to offend as many people on the planet as possible, of Christians, Jews and Muslims? To historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... in fact, was anyone not offended? Anyone who had a minimum taste would have grimaced at this!
