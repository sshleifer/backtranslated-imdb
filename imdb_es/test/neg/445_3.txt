Once upon a time there was a great American movie. That combined horror and comedy with the same emotion. This film had intelligent direction Novelty special effects and superb comedy and serious acting. It was titled "An American werewolf in London." Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel finally settled on the cardboard outside its local theater. Surely I would have at least some of the emotions of the original. Think again. 'An American werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from beginning to end unfortunate. The problems begin with the protagonist. The performance of Tom Everett Scott is hard and tedious. From the beginning, he seems determined to prove that all young people are simple. In his defense, not even an experienced Shakespearean actor could have extracted a good performance from the youthful and witty dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, whose soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved by one of the werewolves, can finally move on to the afterlife. Then he tells Scott and his friends. 'Okay guys, see you.' What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon appears as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, she is a French girl who plays the French girl. It is not much stretching. But all this stupidity is not the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Special effects, as an integral part of the excellent original movie, are very short on this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And it does not matter how well he sculpts a cartoon with muscular lycanthrope muscles. It is still difficult to be scared of a caricature. So instead, the American holiday gang, led by the ultra-weak Scott, still finds excuses to return to the den of the werewolf catacombs. Here it is much easier for this incompetent special effects team to keep the creatures enhanced by computer or masks of absurd beasts under cover of darkness. Some have said that if you do not see this movie as a sequel, it is not so bad in comparison. I do not agree, this movie can not stand on its own, and it is even more of a disgrace compared to the original brilliant. If you do not want to be seen as a sequel, you should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 movie. I do not care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you adored the 'American werewolf in London'. As I did this myself it is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys, see you.' Terrible. 3 of a possible 10 T.H.
