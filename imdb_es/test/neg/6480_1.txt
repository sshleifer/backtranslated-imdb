I hardly know where to start. <br /> <br /> Great continuity problems, bad performance, etc. For example, Sam is supposed to be far away from anyone, but you can see the ski slopes cut in the mountain next to his head. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, the adventure of Sam paving the way to improve the fate of his whole family, is not even mentioned. Instead, in the film, he gets angry with his family and lets his wealthy parents be alone and, when he gets tired of it, goes home. Where is your development? Where is the arch? <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book and can go through the visions of falcon 60/3 (double / triple / quadruple visions of the hawk) and terrible production quality (crepitus, ahem, fire, winter winds that stop their howl for dialogue and then restart, etc.) I guess * could * be fine for an 8-year-old child. <br /> <br /> But compared to the sophistication of the book, it is a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
