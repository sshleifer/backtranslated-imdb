Terrible performance, terrible script, totally unrealistic. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is an example of the clich√©s and sentimentality that movie studios love to clog the throats of spectators. Elijah Wood is unimaginably bad in the main role, and the plot points are contrived and sappy. The relationship of Cook and Wood is, at best, ridiculous. But the worst element of Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most disturbing dialogues I have had the misfortune to hear. The bumblebees that really crawl into my ears and sting my eardrums would be preferable to listening to Elijah Wood spit robotically his pseudo-deep lines. I would like to have a "Bumblebee Project", so luckily I could not have any memories of this stink.
