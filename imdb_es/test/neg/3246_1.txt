Hello, this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. The day I saw this movie, I had a high fever. But I still watched the movie with a lot of patience. And after watching the movie, I wanted to regret it. Because, I wasted 3 hours for this stupid movie. I could have taken a break instead of watching this movie. And I was very surprised that actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab, etc. will act in this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand if the directors do not find a good story to make a movie, why? Do they remain as directors? Why can not they sit at home and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all directors to do well if they request hearings, either by mail or through media, newspapers, radios, etc. ... to send them a nice story if they do not. Find any good story to make a movie. I ask all directors again not to do those films.
