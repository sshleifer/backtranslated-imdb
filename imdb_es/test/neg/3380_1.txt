Although I could summarize this pathetic episode of the Night gallery in two words, those two words are "horse manure" and I am obliged to write a minimum of ten lines. This is a very sophisticated episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an inept attempt at some kind of ironic black comedy. The premise of the giant rodents that inhabit the moon, an orb without life, without a doubt, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we must also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes that were broadcast for the first time on that date. In short, a waste of film, actors and time on the air.
