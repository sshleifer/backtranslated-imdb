Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a writer of moderately successful magazines, while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Happily for her, Chloe gets a great role in a situation comedy and temporarily moves to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen book a flight to LaLa Land, as a surprise. However, when he arrives at his trailer, the "house" trembles, as Chloe and her co-star have a small romantic date. The writer and the actress are finished. Wounded and angry like a hatter, Owen returns to New York. His sympathetic friends decide to organize a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his bad mood. But, it goes wrong, since the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly because each one has a strong personality and Owen's huge shoulder chip. However, in the next few months, surprisingly, Nadine and Owen become friends, trust each other and come together. Can it become something else? Well, who the hell cares! This movie is so STUPID that most people will take it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, depressing and, oh, stupid too. On the other hand, Krumholtz also offers a very unpleasant and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could look good with the lines he has to let go? William Baldwin, too, reaches his lowest point in his career with his rough and crazy sex as Owen's brother. The only cast member who is good is Richards, but she must cringe when she looks back. Okay, the costumes and production values ​​are adequate. Then, also, there is AN intelligent element in which, occasionally, the characters will speak their lines but the bubbles of cartoons will appear on their heads with the words of what they really think. That does not save the movie from the "bomb" state. Do not be stupid, dear lovers of cinema and romcom. Do not rent, buy, or borrow this gigantic turkey. I am the stupidest person on earth, today, to see this THING until the bitter end.
