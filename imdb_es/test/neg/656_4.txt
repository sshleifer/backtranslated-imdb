A tremendously unequal movie in which the biggest problem is the uncomfortable mix of comedy and suspense. For me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedy, and they should have opted for a full comedy. For example, Rock has some fun lines, but occasionally it's too disgusting for a comedy. The scene in which Betty's husband becomes despondent is too unpleasant for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the leftist writer of Hollywood who preaches to us through the character of Freeman, from the beginning, about the difficult situation of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny in that segment, but that's a lot harder than just writing a boring PC speech to him. <br /> <br /> There is still more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only does not receive the child, but does not get any children; In fact, the message is that the girl does not need any children! Little of a feminist statement there. The first half hour is weak, but the film improves, ironically, once Zellweger arrives in Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not a Kinnear fan, although it's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as always; she has the kind of cute American looks that should attract almost all men, and I have to wonder why more of those women are not "represented" today, rather than the dogs that inexplicably became stars, like Diaz, Roberts. , Aniston, Lopez or Barrymore. <br /> <br /> As the film tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize the character of Freeman, who is the gangster equivalent to the world of movies, the hook with the -heart of gold. Nor is there anything in the relationship between Freeman and Rock that even remotely suggests that they were father and son.
