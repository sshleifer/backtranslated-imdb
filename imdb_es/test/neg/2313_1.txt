I do not recommend watching this movie. It is a film in which a film is filmed, without attraction between the actress and the actor. The sex scene at the end of the film, which consists of explaining the reluctance of the actress (who is being interpreted in the film) to cooperate with the actor (which is being played in the film), is a direct repetition of the same scene in the Breillat. Fat girl movie. Everything that was played there with more delicacy, if you can attach delicacy to a sexual act like that. A typical French expression for what happens in Sex is comedy is Oh la la! There is also sensitivity in Breillat's Breve Crossing movie. In Sex is comedy I do not see a real sensibility and neither is a clear plot for the film developing, so there is a pretty loose story with the disappointment of the ending.
