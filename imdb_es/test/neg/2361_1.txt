I can not believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross-section of the "bright and young things" of its time, but I'm sure I wish it were not so. In my opinion, it is a piece of inaccurate, ill-acted, badly written, pretentiously directed gumpf. The brief exits to an imagined reality envelop any humor until death. Situations are subtle exaggerations that make the already weak characters even more incredible and detestable. The romance is boring, the ending is not satisfactory and ruins the only sensible drug message in the film and the simple plot ('Withnail and I', 'Fear and disgust') is put to the test with the uninteresting movement of the movie. In short, this film as a blatant visual assault without any skill or initiative. I condemn him to the pile of ashes in the story and pray that he stays there.
