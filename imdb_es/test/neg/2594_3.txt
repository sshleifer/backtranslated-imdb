Family man. When the program aired for the first time, it was fresh, original and quite funny. Now, I have stopped seeing it. It has become one of the worst television shows, combining jokes without grace, repetitive and strange jokes, and the hope that each joke can become fun with the inclusion of the word "whore". Seth Macfarlane clearly has problems with himself, and obviously is pleasing the audience of 13-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how something that started so funny, so different from everything else, can give you back to this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. Seriously, I've heard something better in a line of a pud comic. <br /> <br /> It is really sad to see that the big shows fail, and see how the nonsense continues. Either Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying, or thinks this show is very funny as it is. <br /> <br /> Either way, God helps us. <br /> <br /> I hate this program, and I will Dance an Irish template when it is finally canceled.
