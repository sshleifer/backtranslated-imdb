A good line of actors and a plot apparently nice, although not original, promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors met the standards (Juliette Lewis, as tender as ever, William Hurt solid but in the background, Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to stay committed to the story and, the turn at the end was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was kind to him, so guess what? So, the last subsequent turn? I do not know what to think about that. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Contract with the devil, or just for her to move? What! The movie had a good idea behind it, but the idea did not develop in detail. It could have been good, but it was not. Too many loose ends to tie, Columbo would say.
