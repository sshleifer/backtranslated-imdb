I usually applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is a kind of parody in ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just could not. The jokes are not funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese films, and most of the time I like and understand the humor that is used in those movies. "Red Shadow" is nonsense!) The characters that appear in this movie know that this is not A) Yes. A serious film and shows that everything is about fun. Look at the characters in the skits as "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is done with a serious face and never leaves the character! And because of this, certain scenes become fun and hilarious. In "Red Shadow" the actors never achieve that. The ninja of the shadow is supposed to be very skilled and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors do not do everything possible to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with a serious face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The poor choreography of the action scenes also damaged the visual experience for me. I like humor in martial arts films as long as the action is good. "Red Shadow" simply fails in that department. So what remains to be enjoyed. Well, the music (techno) was edifying. It had to be like the action itself is never exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor, lack of history and depth make me think that this film is aimed at children. But I wonder if the children would like this movie. Waste of time!
