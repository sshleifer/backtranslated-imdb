I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangular friendship between a girl and two boys. As I experienced this situation and I get lost in it, I hope that a similar story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) and How (b) is the triangle formed? - Why (c) and how (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: "because it's better!" <br /> <br /> (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together. Mine was closed: everyone knows the others, but never the three are together or talk about the missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer spoken explanations, but prefers visual and emotional assumptions. : the ending comes with the sensuality, the sexuality that emerges in the triangle, or more exactly, when for a member, the deep feelings are linked with the intimacy and, as for the last and the first, they can be divided. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and in my story, silence is the proof that something is not right ... And in an ironic and painful way, the tool for these sad times, is always the phone: I lived through this terrible planned call: "Call me: I'll wait for you"? And when the time comes, the phone is silent. A variation is also shown, when the line is connected but one refuses to speak. All those scenes were very difficult for me to see. <br /> <br /> If the film was very helpful in that way, it also had many flaws: <br /> <br /> - I zapped. about the child's family problems <br /> <br /> - Why is the shower scene on the cover of the DVD cut in the film? <br /> <br /> - How does Mickael finally get to the hotel? <br /> <br /> - Clément is always watching Salomé? he says "no", but he has his address; And who is the girl who is with him in the bar: his girlfriend? How can she know about the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what finally happens to Vanessa: the ring in the final session is a test of commitment ??? with whom ?????
