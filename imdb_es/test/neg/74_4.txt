Unfortunately, talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent can not have attractive ideas that turn into artificial nonsense about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite the risky behavior of the mother. Apart from several good sequences, do not buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she is too intrinsically intelligent and focuses as a lady of demon care), and her natural-based personality is a bad choice for the role of an irresponsible parent . Natalie Portman is doing much better than her daughter, and yet her work is very strange (and some of her scenes, like the one in which she asks a child to undress, are wrong and uncomfortable to see). Certainly, it is not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it is not a film that can be embraced, and it has not proven to be important either. ** since ****
