Asmali Konak has become one of the best television series out of Turkey. With its unique cinematic and visual approach to filmmaking, the series has gained a broad following base with continuously broken rating records. Personally, I do not agree with the singers becoming actors (therefore, Ozcan Deniz, the main actor), but I think the figures speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plot. Years in the making, this film was able to monitor every ancestry story that existed within the series. Not only that, cultural errors were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members dancing (Greek style) and breaking plates, which does not exist anywhere within Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue that the film should be taken as an independent film, not as a continuation of the television series, but this theory has an important downfall: the way it was marketed was that it will continue where the series stopped and will conclude the series once and for all. . So with that note in mind, I and everyone I know, would have asked for a refund and would have agreed to stop outside the theater to warn other victims.
