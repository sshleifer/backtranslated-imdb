An obvious charge on the * Insert monster here * In a plane trick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you expect it to be. <br /> <br /> The movie has little or no plot, which is what you would expect from a movie like this. Although, it's fun in parts, I must say. The zombie action is particularly entertaining. Once the movie starts, it never stops; The rhythm is solid. <br /> <br /> The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The ending seems to leave the movie open to a sequel. Hopefully that does not come to fruition. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I recommend it to you; It is worth at least one watch. However, if you are just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
