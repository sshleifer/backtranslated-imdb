I would bet that the one-month salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for TV. Other reviewers attest that MSR was a theatrical movie, and I will take your word. The logical answer must assume that it was originally filmed for television, and after a change of heart, it was launched in its place in a theatrical way. Each actor is primarily a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... all TV artists. Lee Van Cleef divided his time between television and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has only made 3 or 4 appearances in "real" movies in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career, proof that it was filmed for television. Minor players are veteran small-screen actors that can be seen on old replays of "Gunsmoke," "Wild Wild West," "Streets of San Francisco," and so on. <br /> <br /> are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets, which are often seen on television from old episodes. And the edition betrays the rushing of the TV of one or two shots, with limited camera movements, positioning, cuts and lighting. The soundtrack, exclusive of Berstein's original songs, is directly from the television of the seventies. Yes, I would bet the money that was filmed for television. <br /> <br /> That is an important point in the evaluation of MSR. Initially I saw the MSR on the cable, assuming it was an old theatrical premiere. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it's a joke, a caricature, an amateur attempt to make movies. Performance, lighting, writing, adjustments, action, cinematography, music (except Berstein themes), editing, rhythm, ... again and again ... all pale compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven", which is close of the Perfect 60's Western, and one of the best action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> However, seen as a movie made for television in the early 70s, as I suspect, the movie is actually better than average. Those unfortunate enough to live the 70's as an adult, know what I'm talking about. MSR would have competed against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similar network programs. During the Seventies, "Gunsmoke" was a quality program, which focused on the development of the character instead of the action, and emphasized the weapon game to two shootings per week. The first shooting, usually a murder, sets in motion the plot of the hour; The second shooting ends the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis or resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than a whole "Gunsmoke" season. In this sense, in this frame of reference, MSR is a passable entertainment, a cut above the TV rate of that decade.
