This movie had very few moments of true drama. After the first few minutes, the film descended in a spiral that did not take us to hell and back. Seeing it was purely purgatory, to say the least. The acting was more horrible than the theme of the film and, sometimes, I could not stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was extreme: the characters disappeared from the scenes without explanation, only to be replaced by other characters who minutes before had been elsewhere. Surely this was a parody of The Exorcist. The collection plaque in the church must have been filled with copper the day Russo signed up for it. Do I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.
