Oh, boy, it's another kite movie that hits the ground. Within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and several other stupid movies with rap stars in them, you'd think people would burn out with this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping it's not horrible: Dennis Hopper was in that, after all, and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and many other esteemed actors, Hopper has a penchant for appearing in scary movies. Not only that, but it seems that he prepares for them taking classes on how to act. His performance in Tychus is so horrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to say about this garbage, other than if you like things. In Earth movies, look at Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys in a stretch. Forget the others completely. This really is the bottom of the stack.
