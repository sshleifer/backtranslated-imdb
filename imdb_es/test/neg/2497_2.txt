Six stars for the representation of Paul Newman of General Groves, four refusals for the inclusion of a highly fictional event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character, or at least his destiny, is loosely based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He carried out his lethal "The Dragon's Tail" experiment in May 1946. This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions. If someone had died of radiation poisoning in Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it is very possible that the scientists had stopped their work abruptly and that history had changed. Either for good or for bad, we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director if they added Merriman's dramatic character or if they broadcast an anti-nuclear message. For a more equitable and accurate treatment of events at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, watch the television movie, "Day One," or better yet, read Peter Wyden's book on which it is based.
