Solomon and Sheba have fallen in Hollywood history not because of the quality of the film, but because of the fact that Tyrone Power died while doing it. I was in fifth grade and I remember well the great news of the days when that tragedy happened. I did not know who Tyrone Power was at that time, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of their work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had an idea about this movie and the failure it showed. He was the anonymous producer of this too. Maybe he just did not want to face the critics. The good thing is that Power really came out with Witness for the Prosecution although you can see it in long shots if you look closely. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stew that would probably disconcert the great Solomon. Several incidents described in the Bible that the Bible deals with separately are woven into a single plot with some additions released by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The real story about the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a commercial mission to the Kingdom of Israel, conversed a little with Solomon, returned with many commercial goods and that was it. The story of a romance between her and Solomon is a legend. <br /> <br /> The queen never witnessed Solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims. a baby, nor was she involved with the construction of the First Temple. Nor was she because of the destruction of it. For that matter, neither was Solomon. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when Solomon's brother, Adonijah, filed a counterclaim. That is the heart of this movie. Adonijah, hearing the news that King David is dying, declares himself king. Of course, David meets temporarily and says that God approached him and told him that Solomon should succeed him. When David finds out what Adonijah did, he says that that is what made God go wrong, Adonijah was greedy. After that, Adonijah starts to conspire. <br /> <br /> Things seem to take a complete turn in the sense that Ty Power collapsed on the set as he faced George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, especially in Lloyds of London, which was the great role of Power. If Sanders is not at all sophisticated and tired that he was in Samson and Delilah, it is still the biblical Sanders cavern. <br /> <br /> When the Power died, Yul Brynner was taken to interpret Solomon and was given a wig so that the existing images Power in the long shot could be saved. Brynner reverses the dialogue with the proper dignity, but I think he probably regretted hitting him. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and is seductive as a biblical temptress in the tradition of Cecil B. DeMille. . He seems to have no real conviction and I guess he was surprised by the sudden disappearance of Power and had to do it all over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> The real story with Adonijah is not as elaborate as this movie. He argued with Solomon about the succession and gathered around a group of some of King David's courts as supporters. Solomon forgave them once and then Adonijah asked Abishag in marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears that, he decides that Adonijah is becoming greedy and kills him. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah who was basically making contract visits to the Adonijah supporters. <br /> <br /> What we have in the movie is a spectacular climax that involves a miracle that I searched for and could not find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor, who finished a long and distinguished career on a sour note. It was a matter of Vidor trying to outdo Cecil B. DeMille in a biblical show. <br /> <br /> He did not make it.
