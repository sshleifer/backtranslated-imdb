I like to think I've seen it all. DOOMTROOPER SS. That of a family of saber-toothed tigers. That of a family of pteranodons. GOAT DINING ROOM. DEMON CHILD (a rubber dummy for children not animated with horns stuck in the head) Several SASQUATCH movies, none of them good, a couple of giant spider / insect movies, endless sections of HELLRAISER, endless LEPRAUCHAN sections. Sections of endless JASON. 'EM, which is actually an urban parade recorded on someone's $ 199 camcorder, and so on.I watched part of an STV the other night about people stranded on a deserted island of kickboxing with I have even sat through DREAMCATCHER, as recently as last night, well, I must say that I sat through parts of it, having seen it in all its terrible glory years ago. PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of young people trapped on an island during a storm, forced to fight with aliens that arrive in a meteorite.It seems that the meteorite came out of a SUPERMAN caricature of the 1 940. The same goes for aliens, actually. Photography, acting and direction. and Writing is equally bad. I turned it off in half. Good luck.
