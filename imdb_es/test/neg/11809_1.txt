A Pre-Nerd Robert Carradine, a Pre-Automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and an almost pre-pubescent Melanie Griffith hit the road and head to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon fishermen. Well, your dream is as exciting as this dazzling road youth movie. They are not particularly interesting, and the film does not make much sense, beyond `We met with the generation of some famous people and made a low-budget film about their misadventures. ' Outside the canyons of the road movies of the 60s and 70s and the rebellious youth films, this is mediocre, underdeveloped, does not involve the characters, not much ingenuity or a lot of freshness to the story, which is as insipid as the films of muddy landscape. <Br /> <br /> But, for those who care, they go to Alaska and, apparently, Alaska was like the Wild West in the 70s, because they all carry a gun and they are rough and crashed. Robert Carradine says charming things like: "I hope we can find a shower, I'm crazy". (And he is the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are robbed and forced to take jobs quickly, and the local big shot, his employer, puts the moves on Melanie and finally dismisses Desi for not being corrupt . That's when they are not smart and they do not leave the city, instead they choose to eat dog food or go hungry, be beaten by the boys' bullies and then take a ride in the car of the big shots. The final half of the film leaves the evil bigwigs when the trio commits a robbery, flee, and incubate a scheme of kidnapping, and so on. The film has just ended, in an annoying and ambiguous way, but first of all, seeing that they did not bother having a lot of character development and history, it is quite appropriate. It's worth checking out if you like the low budget rate of the 70s, but in the end it's pretty forgettable.
