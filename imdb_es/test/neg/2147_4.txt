I do not know which one was released for the first time in the early 1970s. Cannon for CÃ³rdoba is a "Europen Western". It was manufactured in Spain. This means that it is quite inferior to the so-called #Espagueti Occidental by Sergio Leone and the real Masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann, in my order of merit. This order should not be interpreted since all John Ford's westerns are better than all by Sam Peckipahn. I think the 100 of IMDb classify them pretty well. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this firm is the casting. George Peppard is fit for the role of a sergeant, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties in Rome.
