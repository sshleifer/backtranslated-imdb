Throughout its 2 hours of duration, Crash describes the emotional anguish of its set of 10 characters when they face forms of racism sometimes brazen and others latent in American society. That and the emotional anguish of one of his audiences sitting near the front and trying desperately to make sense of what the movies have become these days. <br /> <br /> The era in which we live has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the not so enthusiastic ripple of postmodernist ideas is always being torn down by what, post-postmodernism, which aims to destroy all these ideas, is not in part thanks to the great destructivist. Ideas of those great 'thinkers'. But I digress. This does not have much to do with the theme of the movie, but rather what the movie is. <br /> <br /> Sure, it seems difficult to make a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post post post all cynicism has become something more than a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think, like it or not. And that's how a new study product was born! Independent films, which were once energetic and idealistic in their defiant experimentalism, now appear to be as firm as Hollywood movies to sell to independent film markets. An independent film must be sold at Sundance before being "acclaimed". And so nothing is simple anymore. Even what constitutes a good movie becomes so murky. Whereas in the past the filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story, and in these apparently simplistic attempts, the best films are born: today's filmmakers have to make films that are good in the first place; Movies have to make people think, they have to be meaningful, they have to be provocative, ask questions, yadda yadda yadda. It all comes down to, it's a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the similarity of formula of Hollywood movies, the innumerable ways of differentiating themselves essentially to be the same product. <br /> <br /> And I have not even started on the movie yet. Maybe I've become too demanding with the movies I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to entertain myself, instead of, for example, being investigated when watching a movie. But hell, this movie is a big load of garbage. And this movie disgusts me, not only because it follows the guide to How to Make a Good Good Film 101 to the T-shaped characters that emit eloquent lines and are as witty as if they were gifted with God's speech; raises questions about racism and life facing racism in the United States; has "moving" moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you hear the soundtrack of new ambient / new era music that you sing in high quality records in foreign languages, you will know that you meet all the above characteristics. <br /> <br /> And something about it The point mentioned above (about asking questions about immediately pressing issues such as racism) bothers me a lot. Like all post-post-post-post-post movies, it does not compete with just having a message about this problem. Because, oh, our audiences are very smart for that in these days in this world post post post post post. Our audiences want us to make them think, we do not want to put things in such a simplistic way (and then they'll get into existentialist shit and say) that's because life itself is not simplistic. Hahaha. What other common simulation do we have here? Then, the public should think about the problems instead of feeding them. It's fine, it's good, and it's fine. So, the movie makes it a point to hit audiences with these non-messages and, since they're not exactly a message, it's so subtle and subtle that it means good, right? So we are being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony was not pronounced enough, we have a ridiculous character, the only character who does not seem to take seriously all this nonsense about racism, being "converted" into one of those irritatingly significant characters where he learns something final. giving meaningful gazes and pauses where audiences must "learn something about themselves as well". Um, yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist movie right after this man. <br /> <br /> For short, I do not think I would have bothered with the movie if it was not so bloated in its self-importance The anguish that forms the whole movie felt more like a whining of a white boy than anger Real by Spike Lee-ish. It's like Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the guy who wants to wave flags about humanism when the only thing they do not realize is the flag they're waving is their underwear full of holes. Also, it has become so modern in the world post post post post to be completely subtle about it. Nothing is simple anymore. In his best effort to be really good, provocative and, ultimately, human, he has become neither, imho, just another shit independent of an independent director who wants to make a name for himself as a credible independent filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood is simpler and more honest in its handling capacity.
