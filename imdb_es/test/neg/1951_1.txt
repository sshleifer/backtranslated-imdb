Talk about garbage! I can not think of anything good in this movie. The script was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, well, there were no effects. I can not believe that the writer of this film did Identity, everything in this movie made me sick from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box shows a showman with shark teeth and terrifying eyes. I think a scary villain, but like the old saying "never judge a book by its cover", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut. In one part of the film a girl is killed by some salad tongs, terrible. The scenario was bad enough, as if they could have established everything in Lapland, but not, instead, a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a parody, I think they wanted it to be just the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way were the sticky effects. You can argue that I have not seen the first, but seeing this would be safe if I did not try. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effect, the snowballs looked like they were made at home, and that carrot was a complete shame. If I wanted to guess that the budget for this movie would be between 8 and 9 pounds fifty. The panic producer at the last minute seized the actors on the street and handed them the script and told them they had 6 minutes to practice these lines and film on an island. painful, it was as if the actors had forgotten their normal lines and had made the right path. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this film: 0 stars out of 5
