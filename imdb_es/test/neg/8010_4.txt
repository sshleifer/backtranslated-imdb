Years ago, "MA2412", the feature film tried to be a kind of "regional box office hit" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope that nobody from outside has to see this time. Maybe if you're familiar with the original comedy it might be interesting to see what director Sicheritz did about his series. I think he lost his chance and lost time and money. <br /> <br /> So far, many directors and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible with a 90-minute film (consider Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult this is by watching "MA 2412". The result of this attempt in my opinion is like an endless TV episode (and not a good one). It fails to deliver a plot, the mood is too much effort and the direction seems very unfocused, as with the visual style. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I clearly would not recommend it ...
