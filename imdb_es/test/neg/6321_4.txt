I was ready to love "Where's Poppa," which presents the nexus of characters from Comedy Normal Lear characters who, when I grew up, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family the size of a raisenette. How fun it would be to see Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a pre-SNL Garret Morris free of censorship. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, "Where's Poppa" crawls. It is claustrophobic and laborious, and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, the lightness of the mood and the accelerated pace. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his dominant Jewish mother, who lives in his gigantic New York apartment. On the way, we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a comic group of muggers who repeatedly assault the main character's brother, the rape of a policeman involving a gorilla suit and the subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden lowering Segal's pants and biting his ass while he serves dinner. Why does not this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of the fatality engendered by the dark and narrow interiors and the ancient decoration. No doubt, I ate the cinematography of New York during this era, but seeing this movie I felt like I was flipping through the Police Gazette in a dark bus terminal. <br /> <br /> The main reason is the slow pace. Modern MTV-style quick cuts have changed what viewers believe is a comfortable editing rhythm, but, even with this in mind, camera shots remain for an excessively long time. The developments of the plot are also very slow. There is a situation in which this works: a strange love song that George Segal sings to Trish Van Devere, softly, very close to his face and for an unbearably long period of time. It reminded me of those extended and trembling shots in the British version of "The Office", where you are mentally begging the camera to cut, and at the same time you can not stop looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the movie is more "rushed" than "I can not look the other way". What made me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the seriousness of the theme in a black comedy tends to overload the lightness of the farce. Movies like "M * A * S * H" by Robert Altman and "Dr. Strangelove" by Kubrick show that it can be achieved. They do it not only through speed, but also through entertaining subplots, something that "Where's Poppa" neglects. <br /> <br /> Although the film presents multiple characters, stereotypically funny, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama. How to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes with Garret Morris and the robbers of Central Park are so close as the viewer comes to a mental break. The robbers seemed almost Shakespearean, following the ne'er-d0-wells comic tradition. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had clung a bit more to the scenic tradition, it would have been a better movie. Edgier is not always better. It's as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were a little before the creative maelstrom of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Random notes: After spoiling Ron Liebman's clothes, the Muggers mention Cornel Wilde "The Naked Prey" (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor of the "Planet of the Apes" of 1968. <br /> <br /> As politically incorrect as it was, it is disturbing to learn about the death of an action hero As formidable as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played "Nova," Taylor's silent partner, said that James Fransicus, in the sequel, seemed cute and small compared to Heston.
