"Low budget" films like this only give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. In other words, if there are people who are willing to finance a piece of money like this, then there is certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like me who can really write stories. This movie is up there, or I should say "down there" with Ed Wood's of the World. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention second-year acting, is a parody of the genre itself. Someone should have moved a stake through this stench while it was still on paper. It follows that, since the literature has practically been eliminated, that film should continue. To have a good or even passable movie, you must have at least a decent script. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes to mind. They used many of their stories for the low budget films of a long time ago, but even today they come out as a good and serious entertainment, that is, "The Brain of Donavan". The cast of this "job" should seriously consider going back to work in their respective hamburger shops or shoe stores and forgetting about any weak future attempt to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this as the plague itself!
