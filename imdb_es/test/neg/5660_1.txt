The first act is so terrible, except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show. I should stay with Drake and Josh. The only person I like, besides Spencer, is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$. Patale√≥ Carlys Crews @ $$ and I liked <br /> <br /> The episode that I hate a lot is Imyourbigesstfan I hate that young Icaly fan She almost killed me False is a good word to describe this, please , do not see this on TV is good. Go with the classics, as family matters. Let everyone go back to Doug Nick's version, please do not look I hate Icarly Oh, also Nathan Kress is a Wannabee Fredie Highmore
