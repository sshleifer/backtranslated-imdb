Beginning with a poem of tears and images of American missiles, hungry children and mutilated Palestinians, I quickly realized that it was not going to be an objective documentary. Five young people convicted after the riots in Gothenburg are interviewed and give a very confusing explanation of why they had to destroy the city center and then (oh my God) have paid for what they have done. I kept looking and many questions were asked, was the trial carried out correctly and the police officers had the right to do what they did? Many questions asked ... and then it fell. Without interviews with judges or reviewing documents about the trial ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: nothing new that every Swede has seen on television a hundred times, just a poor propaganda.
