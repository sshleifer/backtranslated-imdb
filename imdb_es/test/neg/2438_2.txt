Oh darling. This was possibly the worst movie I've seen in years. I mean, what else can be done with the story of the old "woman inside the body of man"? It was full of clich√©s, for example, the nerd entering his own sequence, the "boy" getting what was coming to him, etc. I'm not calling these spoilers because anyone could guess what happens! The only thing that had in his favor was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the "dreamed" child, that was the wettest performance in history. even the bad guys forgot instantly. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
