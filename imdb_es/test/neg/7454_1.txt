This is by far the worst I've seen in the movie. My uncle's home movies are more talented in them than this shit. <br /> <br /> The plot summary is basically that these twin fighters are playing a survival game with a man and his private army on some island. Man has a very cheap hand in papier-mâché. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious in this movie. There are scene changes in the fall of the hat. For example, for at least 30 seconds we see a guy humming a song for himself that does not add ANYTHING to the movie. This is the worst dialogue I've heard in my life, I do not think this movie can get worse than it already is. I would describe it as an action movie by Chuck Norris that went wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
