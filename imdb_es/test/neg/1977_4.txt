I give this movie a 4 because I'm a big fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and it's nice to see the whole gang in CG form. Sephiroth is still great <br /> <br /> now the reasons why he only got a 4, the characters feel like wooden boards with the most serious acting voice I've seen (I've seen an epic movie) <br / > <br /> the film seems to be so cloud-oriented that it makes even fans feel embarrassed with this cloud and the cloud. The clouds mentioned so much that they do not want to see it in this movie. <br /> <br /> The villains have the prize for the worst villains of all time (I was more scared by the wicked witch of the west) <br /> <br /> all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie to greet the fans and do not take it further than <br /> <br /> wtf with the cold chally ??? <br /> <br /> Summary: I waited 9 years for this movie and this is what I got in a big, pointless and boring scene. I ask the head of square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this recording in each copy of the film and in any one involved in it and create a new movie from the ashes (it would be good to make the film in live action and based on the original game)
