Committed stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline, who is determined to find her ex-husband who is in the process of a mid-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Committed was not at all what I expected to be devoid of comedy, which was ultimately the genre. It went beyond the stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck had a reasonable performance, the recent roles of Graham have been disloyal and this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham's most recent role was Blessed, which also seemed deceptive to me and did not appeal to me at all. <br /> <br /> Affleck Pros <br /> <br /> Cons Predictable, unreal, poor acting and not a comedy movie!
