We present this film in a club as an example of how classical literature can be transformed into some of the most horrible films of all time. The mere fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed that the plot would be established in the future "useless techno" should have been a sufficient clue. I think that word describes the film itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie, the effort was completely useless. Not to mention that our club counselor told us that he supposedly could not get a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure is full of cheesy, clich√© dialogue that is worse than anguished adolescent poetry. The character of Beowulf changes halfway in a way that is not credible, and every time he is in an action scene, he is constantly moving like a gymnastic gymnast. There is even, as they say, a "symbolic black boy" whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And, of course, the daughter of the leader of the outpost that Grendel is terrorizing is a total bitch. A bitch whose breasts are exposed throughout the film. A fox who wants to fight the creature, but she never puts on armor. And his favorite weapon is a small carving knife. And despite her dire situation, she still dresses for dinner, wearing a dress with a transparent skirt that exposes the underwear of her shorts. There are a couple of scenes that could happen as soft porn, and in the second scene they even reuse the images of the first one. I thought Grendel's performance was bad enough, but then came the end of the movie, which showed a display of CGI that might be decent for the 80s, but it's totally ridiculous for an adventure in the late 90s. I could go on, but you should watch this movie to achieve the most ridiculous effect. <br /> <br /> The other members of the club and I managed to have fun watching this by following the example of MST 3K and making fun of it. All the way through I'm still recovering from an extra weapon: a pizza cutter that continuously rotates on a stick.
