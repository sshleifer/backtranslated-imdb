Any student in a film school could make a movie 1,000 times better than a piece of trash. As someone who had read the book, I hoped that even a direct re-narration of the book would make this a fair movie. There is a possibility that a talented director can go beyond Woodward's narrative and make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the director went beyond the Woodward narrative. He added a Hispanic angel named Vel√°squez that was not in the book. He had Bob Woodward interview the dead Belushi in an exchange at the morgue. The movie had all the information of someone drugged in PCP looking at his belly button. <br /> <br /> If this is a problem for you, you will thank me because it is the worst movie ever made.
