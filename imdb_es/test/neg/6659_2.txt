Exceptionally bad! I do not expect much from Garcia, as he is one of the most overrated actors of today, but Keaton really should have known that this movie would stink and come out while he could (it's not that I especially appreciate him, but hey, he did Batman). <br /> <br /> In one scene, Keaton is transferred to a chained hospital and wearing a Hannibal Lecter facial mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can feel the evil you know (vomit)) and Keaton growls making them retreat and whimper with their tails between their legs. Did the movie become comedy there? Garc√≠a deludes himself into an interrogation scene with a dialogue that only a complete delay could find plausible and the child is too upset to feel sorry ... <br /> <br /> If you are going to make such a poor movie A plot like this needs some charm, humor, some solid action. Take Die Hard for example, which is great despite its pretty horrible plot. <br /> <br /> Even though the character of Keatons was a joke, I hit him with all the way. I wanted to see Garcia cry for her dead child and Keaton drinking martinis on an island paradise, however! This movie is a good laugh. Watch it with an ingenious friend and you can have fun while this movie asks for jokes in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thank God she bit her ass.
