I enjoyed Bruce Almighty a lot, but the moment I discovered there was going to be a sequel WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (the babbling scene is one of my favorites) and, in my opinion, deserves an Emmy for his role in The Office, he is quite weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious to see how much work the writers are doing, because we could do without the story. But even if we discard the huge holes in the plot (why did elephants and lions come to help Evan when the flood only affected that particular area of ​​Washington) the movie is just not funny? I did not laugh once and, from what I remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh. Or laugh at least. No this. <br /> <br /> However, there is little hope. Evan Almighty has "family" written everywhere and maybe a family visit could be nice (kids can have fun with the variety of animals and silly jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty just does not do it. br /> <br /> I give it a 4/10 and I hope Carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the show.
