I thought that this movie could be a good parody, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was more like something someone in high school would do with their parents' video camera. It was not just the low budget that makes this film bad (many of the great films have been made on a low budget), it's just a bad movie and it was not even bad enough to be a good camp. Case in point: during the first ten minutes of the film nothing happens, except the 3 main characters who sit in their room smoking drugs, make up and then answer a phone call. You're still waiting for something to move the story, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn up the TV all the way so I could almost understand what they were saying (which was not interesting anyway). If I pay to rent a movie, I will usually suffer it even when it is bad, but it was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems that the person before me felt the same because they did not rewind the tape and they stayed in the same place as me. The only reason I gave this result a score of 1 is because the rating system does not have negative numbers.
