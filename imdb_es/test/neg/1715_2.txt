In fact, I enjoyed Tycus, though not for much more than making fun of production values. Dennis Hopper was fine, although I wonder if he would have signed the project if he had seen the special effects they used. And also, what about the scene with the ninja? That was completely out of rhythm. Maybe someone came up with the brilliant idea in the middle of the shot. Oh well, this movie is great if you're drunk and you need to laugh. Cheers.
