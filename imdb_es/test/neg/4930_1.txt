This is as stupid as possible. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always act exactly against what a person in their right mind would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie" where Carmen Electra flees from the killer. There are two signs, one marked "to safety", the other "to certain death" (I am reciting from memory). <br /> <br /> And just like in Scary Movie, the characters always run in the direction marked "safe death". <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did the girl light the fire in the cashier's cabin and keep the door closed? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead of being killed by the guy? Why, oh, why, after cutting and dominating the driver, did he sit on the seat and watch the wounded instead of simply shooting him or at least knocking him out? He was running over his friend and was killing him a minute earlier, but do they have scruples? Why, oh, why a hundred more things ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so implausible that, at times, it begins to hurt physically. <br /> <br /> Add the exaggerated "actors" mercilessly and with a small budget for that, and this is what you get. Looking at the rating and the comments, I have the feeling that these people have been watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing is the infamous red toolbox of "While She Was Out": a movie that is similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.
