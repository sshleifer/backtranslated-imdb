I do not agree that Dante represents the zombies that support the democrats as creatures with an average intellectual coefficient of 23. I think that his behavior should reflect an IQ lower than that, something of the order of an IQ of Pelosi. .. A single digit figure, please. <br /> <br /> The MOH series is quite uneven, and this is the worst episode. Dante, another carefree Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks with the leftist establishment to rekindle his unfortunate career?), Finally realized that his management activities had been stalled in a low gear for almost two decades. Now, that is where this leftist and unworthy "satire" of the Bush administration, the Republicans and capitalism came from. Maybe he felt that he had not been overtly political before. He would not be exactly the first without talent to use a sinister political propaganda to advance his career, when everything else fails. Dante has been as useful as a contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler, the maker of turds such as "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee". The humor of lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable jokes that even the bluest of all the members of the labor union would have no problems to understand. Or have you ever seen an intelligent, subtle and intelligent liberal satire? Populist manure is the most basic of all messages, therefore, the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as Sean Penn's name. And what better people to send this message to the sheep that eat popcorn than a couple of Tinseltown losers who sniff cocaine and who have fallen so low that they are forced to write for television? I do not want political propaganda, neither to the left nor to the right, in any kind of film. But putting it in horror, of all genres, is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so much in Hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. Dante was so insensitive that he did not even realize the hilarious suggestion that the zombies vote for the Democrats ... (That's what you get when you finish a film school: it's not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any part of the imagination).
