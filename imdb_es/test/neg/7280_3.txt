The famous horror films rarely measure the exaggeration that surrounds them and I have not yet found an offender worse than The Hills Have Eyes by Wes Craven. After I had refrained from seeing this for years, I was really pleased when I bought it for Christmas and waited one night when my girlfriend was out to calm down and watch it, knowing her extreme disgust at something really awful. I should not have bothered. <br /> <br /> After a promising, though familiar start, that firmly establishes the movie in the world of 'Desolution USA' the horror of survival, things fall apart quickly when protagonists and antagonists gather in a desert desert <br /> <br /> With a budget of $ 5, with the cannibal clan costumes contracted at an unsophisticated fancy dress store that specializes in false caveman and Indian red attire, the story follows an annoying group of unfriendly WASPs that they take a detour on a road trip to California, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone (!). When they collapse, they are attacked by the local family of meat eaters and have to fight to survive. <br /> <br /> While I was waiting for another Liberation, the Texas Massacre, the Wrong Turn or the Devil Rejects, I really realized. I tripped over something that should have stayed dusty and unguarded in a place in the backstreet video store. <br /> <br /> With gallons of ketchup for blood and a couple of horrendous close-ups of wounds, I can see how a Certificate 18 is justified (in the UK), but with those close-ups trimmed, this does not It would have seemed like a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV. <br /> <br /> The entire silver mine / secondary plot of the nuclear test site is just a McGuffin to justify the launch of the "civilized" family against the primitives, but given the ease with which the savages are made with the ass, the credibility of thinking that they had survived for a generation taking advantage of the passers-by is stretched. /> <br /> And then there is the end ... or lack of it. It seems that The Hills Have Eyes lack a third act or, at least, a satisfactory outcome. Instead, I kept thinking: "Yes, and ...?"
