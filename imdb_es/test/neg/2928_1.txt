Can this "movie" be considered a movie? Imagine the situation: someone puts a camera by hand on a tripod and in front of a promenade and films people walking or jogging. Then, place the camera on a beach, buy some ducks at a pet store, open their cages and let them run in front of the camera. Later, he simply films the surface of the water and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an experiment or simply an insult to the intelligence of the audience? What would happen if an unknown director made a movie like that? Would we mark your work with 10? I always disappoint the directors who think they can do whatever they want once they became famous.
