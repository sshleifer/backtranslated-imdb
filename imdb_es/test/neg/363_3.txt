The planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster, so humanity now survives an underground division of different religious cults. What caused the catastrophe? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into different ecclesiastical factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life, how can humans cultivate to feed the population? I have no idea . What type of producer thought that this script deserved to receive funding? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of these movies that filters out late at night on cable channels. The type of movie where the IMBb is consulted to see if it has any merit. The number of people who have commented on the PASTOR on this page has not yet reached double figures and this is a film that premiered nine years ago. Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot it is very routine. Former grumpy policeman Boris Dakota, whose wife and son died several years earlier, meets a woman and her son, and it is up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic Westerner. Launch a former fighter who now runs the channel of God, a fascist Christian who is trying to take down Boris, a ventriloquist, some T & A for the sake of that and you have a movie mess. I guess after seeing this DOOMSDAY by Neil Marshall it is possibly a masterpiece of cinema in comparison
