The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two maids arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently, years before, her mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid returned in an effort to irritate relatives who would have forgotten before she or her mother existed. That's because she reasons that if they're surprised enough, they'll pay to get rid of her. Then, with this money, he will leave New Orleans and look for a millionaire in another place, since he pretends to be a countess. On the way, Gary Cooper appears and looks totally out of place as a love interest. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this movie was not the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career collapsed, her acting and her character were so bad! Instead of the elegant and demure woman he used to play in movies, he's probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie. His fake Contessa was superficial, demanding, unpredictable and superbly silly. How could vampirize ANY man seemed a mystery, since she seemed less vampire than simply crazy! I'm not exaggerating to say that she behaved, sometimes, as a person with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all these together make me think "Who in the world would fall in love with this mess? ! " . Frankly, I could not stand to see her narcissistic and histrionic behavior and she looked more like a guest on "The Jerry Springer Show" than a star! Words that are confusing, horrible and exaggerated are those that come to mind when I think about their role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by the disturbance and hysteria of Bergman. Although Gary Cooper is generally an excellent protagonist, he is dominated by her and seems lost. And, interestingly, they launched two oddballs as their entourage: Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs. Robson is best known for her portraits of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some strange reason, they covered her with makeup and the end result looked a lot like the daughter of an Indian cigar and Aunt Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she wore strange eyebrows and dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf and, although this should not be against him, his role was written as if he were a court jester, a very, very ungrateful role for someone who has "vertical challenges"! In general, the bad performance, the writing and the direction of lameness make this one of the great stinkers of the time, almost meaningless and as boring as the famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
