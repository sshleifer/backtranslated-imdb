Wow, what a racist, profane garbage of celluloid garbage, and what an insult to the great genre of westerns. <br /> <br /> Exploitation? Sexual scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and blood abound ... everything that gives modern movies such a good name, especially among those who prefer the films of the classical era. This is the kind of squalor that gives old people ammunition against today's movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I just can not imagine scenes of naked men's baths in the films of Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. I can not imagine myself listening to "Mother! Eh!" he exclaimed here and there. Honestly, I doubt that word has existed more than 100 years ago. However, the word f is so prevalent here that you would think you were looking at a story centered on urban areas today, not the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? Well, what if all the white characters were good and every black person was the brutal and nasty villain? Do you think someone could complain about a racist movie? Back home do not hear a clamor when the reverse, as shown in this film, appears in hundreds of theaters across the country? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently, he is the "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee would not be so racist. You can not get much worse than this movie.
