Inglourious Basterds IS the worst Tarantino movie I've ever done. It is full of its usual ingredient, that is, an agile dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but everything feels like a deja-vu. The address is typical tarantina and nothing seems new at all. It is almost as if it had been copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that is not funny or brilliant like Pulp Fiction. Basterds is supposedly Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti western, but it seems to be poorly articulated and misplaced, especially with the continued use of large subtitles and the audience of balance.
