This was a very brief episode that appeared on one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode was starring Sue Lyon (of the fame of the movie Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, who plays a babysitter and a vampire respectively . The vampire hires a babysitter to take care of her son (who seems to be a kind of werewolf or monster) while going out at night in search of blood. The babysitter is totally oblivious to the appearance of the vampire when she sees him for the first time and only begins to put two and two together when she realizes that she has no reflection in the mirror, she has a strange collection of books in the library about the occult , and he hears strange noises while the vampire is going to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought she was originally. He runs out the door, the vampire comes out puzzled and the episode is over. I do not know what was the purpose of making such a short episode that lasted only 5 minutes. They should have expanded the previous episode in those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total effort wasted.
