How offensive! Those who liked this movie probably never opened a bible. I can imagine the NBC saying, "Well, let's make a movie to appease these annoying Christians, but they will never know the difference if we do not have anything real or in the correct chronological order". Well, they were wrong. Anyone connected with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their participation in this atrocious blasphemy. I only gave this movie a 1 because I could not give it a 0.
