If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you are looking for an exhibition on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a film that examines how rural police departments are poorly protected against a well-organized and well-funded gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie full of scene after scene of unintentional humor, horrendous performances, a slender plot and community theater production values, Wild Rebels is the right movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a serial car driver with bad luck named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a violent crash (from which Rod walks away unharmed despite having only cotton pants and a London Fog jacket for protection), Rod decides to leave. With no other plan for their future other than wandering the back roads of the south, he stumbles upon the motorcycle gang of the Satan Angels (a gang are three of the stupidest guys ever to have closed a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share). This group of thugs spend their time terrorizing a rural town in Florida committing atrocities like stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These clumsy idiots need someone to act as their driver during some felonies they have planned. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to perform daring feats that only an experienced cheat driver would be able to keep like the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low-speed chase. Finally, they arrest a bank, get into the low-speed chase mentioned above and have the last battle of arms with the police ever filmed. I could go on forever, but you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "it's so bad that it's good", but that seems apt to describe the Wild Rebels.
