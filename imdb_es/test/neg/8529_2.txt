My Take: Another PG-13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derived plot. <br /> <br /> Spirits move. The walls creak. There is something wrong in the basement. These, along with several other horror movie clich√©s lurk the walls of another house in the country in THE MESSENGERS, produced by Sam Raimi, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown into a savagely recycled plot of better (and some sometimes, even worse) the horror films of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves to an old farm in South Dakota, another attempt by dad (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with his former drunkard - daughter Jessica ( the underestimated Kristen Stewart), in the field more subtle than her house in Chicago. The horror occurs when Jessica begins to receive little surprise visits from the poltergeists of the house. Thinking she is a teenager who cried wolf, her parents do not believe her. How could they? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for what horror movie will go next. Will it be a flock of angry crows wishing more than the family's crops (a direct scam from Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Will the house be haunted with a history that goes back to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be the grotesque ghosts taken from their recent horrors known as THE RING AND THE GRUDE? Heck, the movie even manages to cheat one or two scenes from some really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Perhaps all Pang Brothers really wanted to do was a level B horror movie, but did it have to be so bad? Could not they cheat the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of 5.
