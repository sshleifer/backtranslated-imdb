Looking at these reviews and seeing all these high marks makes me believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please any brain-dead idiot. This movie is useless. All the clich√© of a slasher movie without any substance. I'm sure I could go into detail about the movie, but why bother when it can be summarized? Obviously, everyone wants Mandy Lane and apparently she does not want any of the boys. Throughout the movie, you will see this. <br /> <br /> When she stops being friends with the typical child trapped in the loser of the friends zone, she gets furious and when she goes on a road trip in the middle of nowhere of course) she starts to hunt them down by one. It sounds decent so far right? But what made this movie harder to believe is when you discover that not only is your losing friend the killer, it is also ... The plan was more than ridiculous. We go together to kill all our friends and then kill each other. They do not give any reason why they wanted to do this and like "Goody Too Shoes" by Mandy Lane, it makes you scratch your head even more about what really motivates these characters to do what they are doing. It's sad ... this movie had a lot of potential, but the director or writer apparently can not relate to the audience in any way.
