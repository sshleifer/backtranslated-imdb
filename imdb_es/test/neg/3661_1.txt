My girlfriend and I are really in corny horror movies. Especially those with a lot of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the cover of the box for this movie in blockbuster, we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We began to see it, since we did not expect it to be BIG, but we thought that it would at least attract our interest. Within 20 minutes of the film, we realized that the pace would not increase and that it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to enter it, but the plot did not make much sense, even after reading the back of the DVD box over and over again. The film was filmed very dark and it was quite annoying to try to find out what was going on in each shot. Each violent scene was very difficult to distinguish, and you can never really see the violence you expect. This is definitely a movie without a motive that was filmed poorly and very widespread. Each scene had approximately 20 minutes of the same thing and I felt that I got the point after the first 5. Skip this movie and go back to see another Freddy or Jason movie and you will be much happier.
