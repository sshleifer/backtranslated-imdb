I had seen him on Italian television when I was a kid and I remember that he was fond of him, given that he mixed live action with animation; however, at that time it was totally forbidden ... and, after all these years, updating me again, I must admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What must have seemed wonderful in the eyes of a child is actually very badly done, not to mention boring for a fantasy adventure; fatally, both the star (the former 'Angry Young Man' Richard Harris) and the director (action expert Hunt) are not suitable for the material! At least, Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics provided by screenwriter Don Black) is useful, if not exactly inspired. By the way, a series of well-known personalities appear among the voice artists in this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and, this being his last film Michael Bates) . <br /> <br /> Whereas the essential points of the plot of the classic novel of Jonathan Swift (the 'giant' Gulliver becomes the pawn of a war between the small people of two neighboring countries and, when escaping, ends in a land of real giants) emerge here, is done on a strictly childlike level (with stereotyped characters, although, fortunately, with a small intrusion of the comic / romantic variety), which makes the whole company somewhat useless , outside of its intrinsically experimental nature. Since Max and Dave Fleischer had already made a splendid version of the book's cartoons in 1939!
