The rather terrible movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts reasonably well, but it becomes more bizarre and difficult to swallow as it progresses. Rachel Leigh Cook is the only highlight in a tender and sexy presentation, but I would recommend this movie only to the actress's fans.
