The websites start at 'Chicago: Present Day' when four electricians, Dean (Richard Grieco), Ray (Richard Yearwood), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are about to disconnect electricity from an unused building scheduled for demolition. While looking for the cables and the relevant things, they find a set of doors that, according to the buildings, the plans should not be there, being intrusive and everything that makes the doors open to have a look and find a full room of Computers and scientific machinery. While they are entertained with some buttons, a portal opens to a parallel universe, Dean & Junior accidentally "hooks" and Ray and Sheldon follow shortly after in search of their friends. Unfortunately, they all ended up in an exact parallel Earth that has been taken by a mutant spider that eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers that she uses to protect herself and do what she wants them to do. In a desperate bid for survival, they joined some of the last remaining humans, including the original inventor of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electricians, he could (could ) be able to build another portal to take them back home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu, I thought Webs was crap, it's as simple and straightforward as really. The script of Grenville Case and Robinson Young is absurd to say the least and has plot holes in which you can drive a tank, for example, this movie really tries to suggest that some mutant spiders are not bigger than a couple of people in The size took over an entire world? How did they do this? If this parallel Earth was equal to ours, where the hell was the army? Police? All our weapons? A few fragile-looking spiders against literally billions of humans ?! All the defective, stupid and downright annoying concept bothered me throughout the entire movie. Do not forget that there is an interdimensional portal for a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have remained undisturbed for decades and remain in perfect working order, right? Then there's the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact that an electrician can make it work perfectly by chance when he randomly presses some buttons in a room that probably had hundreds of units spread across dozens of computers and what about the wonderfully careful guy who puts an explosive trap in his base without telling anyone, what would happen if one of his companions had shot him and been smashed by the homemade bomb by his companions? You would not be better pleased, right? What about the food? Do they grow themselves in small patches of vegetables? I could go on and on all day about how bad, badly conceived and badly written the websites are, but I can not bother. The characters are clich√©s and annoying, as is the movie as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only decent thing I can say about Webs is that it is short and moves at a reasonable pace, but when everything is said and done, it still sucks. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has to take a large part of the information. blame here, to begin with, the film seems cheap and the edition to which it is attributed is terrible. There are many inappropriate and annoying slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and they become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses that very annoying quick-cut technique along with a bit of the old choppy camera movement, now I do not know anyone else, but I hate this editing style as it seems a complete incoherent mess. In fact, I do not know a single person who likes this kind of thing and I'm surprised why the filmmakers believe that people like it. Forget about any gore, just a few shotgun wounds to the zombie spider soldiers and they do not have red blood anyway, so it does not relate to the reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> The websites were made for -TV, the American science fiction channel, I think it looks so cheap, on a low budget and hurriedly as expected. Everything is so insipid, forgettable, flat and boring. Special effects are far from special and the spider thing lacks imagination when it is finally revealed. The performance was fine, considering that everything else was very poor and I still can not believe the sweater that Grieco wore in this. <br /> <br /> Webs is crap, I really can not say anything good about it, other than that I've sat in worse movies and that's the only reason why I do not give it 1 star and a quick look at The ratings of the users of IMDb for Webs confirms what they already knew, since it has more '1' votes than any other and there is a very good reason why ...
