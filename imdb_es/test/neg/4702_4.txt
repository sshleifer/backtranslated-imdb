Five years after the US Civil War The people of the West are more concerned about the historic war between the owners and the ranchers. Farmers herd their products, from Texas to the city of Abilene, Kansas. There, the cowboys find not only a large amount of money, but also a great confrontation with homeowners. High in the saddle, Marshal Randolph Scott (as Dan Mitchell) tries to keep the peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience mediating between the hands of the trail and the salon clients. She also juggles the city's best-looking women: the sexy lounge singer Ann Dvorak (as Rita) and the beautiful church lady Rhonda Fleming (as Sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more comedic relief to help shoot. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" begins with a promising symbolism and contrast: the shots interrupt Scott and Mrs. Fleming singing a hymn In the church; then, the camera switches to Mrs. Dvorak sexually singing her room number, which causes a man to shoot his gun with pleasure. After that, it really becomes a pretty standard western; Somehow it is more boring than it should be, but not at all horrible. The young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the farmers. Dvorak's leggy costume is the movie's biggest asset; in it, she is a true mobilizer. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
