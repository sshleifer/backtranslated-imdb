I watched Mogul's VHS video of this. That is another of those old distributors of the 1980s whose catalog I would have liked to have! <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty poor. Although renamed "Do not look in the attic", the main warning that is repeated in this is "Do not go to the villa". Just getting to the village grounds is a bad idea. A character does not enter the attic until an hour after the movie, and really should have done it before because of what was learned there. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Turin, Italy, in the 1950s. Two men are fighting, and one woman is telling them that the villa is forcing them to do it. One man kills the other, then regrets it, and the woman takes out the knife and stabs him with it. She flees from the village, and after leaving a chair she moves alone (what's the use of that?), But when in the garden a hand goes up the floor and drags it to the ground. <br /> <br /> From there, it's today, thirty years later. There is a session that appears suddenly and does not seem to have anything to do with the movie. The children of the prologue woman inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two prologue men seems to reappear as another character too. She is obsessed by some warnings not to go to the village, but they all do it, because if they do not use it, they lose it. People die A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The end is quite poor. Why was the family cursed? Unfortunately, a boring movie. <br /> <br /> On the back of the video box there is a funny small print warning that says "The scenes depicted in this package may be an impression of the artist and do not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film." In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that represents more or less exactly the underground scene dragged by the woman mentioned above, although there are two hands and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes the cover has nothing to do with the movie. I also remember seeing a critic who had a bad scale of movie prediction, in which the films with illustrations on the cover instead of the photos obtained at least one point for that.
