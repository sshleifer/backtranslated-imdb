Rob Lowe must have eaten the whole budget, but I can not blame him for running the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good in this movie. The filming, the editing, the direction, the dialogue, the sets, the make-up, the writing, the casting (especially the girl's child psychiatrist and the impostor), and the story, were all the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this for any other rental selection, or discover that you are screaming vile comments on the television. The silent silence must be silenced forever.
