Over the GW is an almost failure of a debut feature, and not because it is not without trying ... Actually, it is. It is a disaster all the more because its writer, director and technician. Nick Gaglia went through the same rehabilitation cult he represents in the film. Sometimes, a filmmaker for the first time, full of the vigor that comes with the approval of one or two of his fellow film students, gets into a style too disconnected, insecure and dramatically frustrating that the personal part of the story, the Extremely personal side, it gets stained in the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 years old when he enrolled in a horrible program that basically tortured and brainwashed his "patients" with crazy group fear tactics, psychological sessions that could last days and attitudes of rehabilitation leaders that would make the majority of the Nazis shuddered, finally escaped when he was 15 years old. I'm glad he came out, although it could help if he now goes into a real rehab for his cinematic abilities, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, for example, the structure, the right lighting, the fluid movement of the camera, the subtlety with the actors and other basic elements that are perpetually lost here. <br /> <br /> It's even more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that should be shown more to the public (recently there was a Newsweek article that refers to a similar AA worship rehab). Many times one wonders if certain studies of personal characters could work better as documentaries instead of narrative dramas. This is an always annoying feeling in Over the GW, where it almost seems that Gaglia wants to tell the truth but does not know how to communicate it correctly through his characters. The character that one would think is the closest to him, the Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehabilitation in New Jersey, would be the closest to Gaglia, in reality it is much more a being one-dimensional, where there is very little background story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old house) and little connection with his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential than ever takes advantage of a cold stone that He passes his children to another. But I suppose there is a story with its crisis of two years. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, things get difficult (a bare cavity search in the first five minutes), and it soon becomes clear that medical care is more like a cross between anger management and a strange religious sect, where the chief doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a loon who controls completely. But soon, Tony's sister, Sofia (Donohue), is thrown into the program and, unlike the repeated moments of outrage and Tony's alleged lack of compliance, she goes through the three-step program and, once freed, becomes in a fugitive. Sometimes there are fragments in this fractured nightmare, where there is a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half and discovers that she became a prisoner who is not allowed to leave, and when the father arrives. the main brothers and makes a furious visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them, which contain some raw power, very brief glimpses that Gaglia could at least get some influence on the pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are few and far between. It is not just the failed characters, who are mostly reduced to the stereotypes that become a hysterical D.A.R.E. Scams (maybe some of them, like an angry young black man, passive aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister, who is shaken by the brothers for having received a blow from an articulation and almost launched into the program, would resonate) if there was more time to develop some of them). Is that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles in his small budget of $ 30,000 that there is not a side of any potential talent he may have. Excessive use of dyes, mostly with a tone that seems to be covered in urine), shake your handheld DVX camera as if it were intense for the City of God, from time to time a character simply shoots at the frame, his or her options the music is like the worst possible selections of the pseudo-indie soft rockers, and there are even scenes of false interviews with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky that feel as false as possible. <br /> <br /> Could Gaglia simply have no interview with the real victims he was with and resort to the possible cathartic plan artistically B? In short, no matter how much real-life stories appeal to you from the heart, do not bother watching them in the theater, or even renting them, unless you like a final scene with two children looking at digital.
