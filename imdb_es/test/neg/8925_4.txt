Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal that pretends to be a spiritual being, but hit heads and kill as if it were nothing. He, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage. How sweet. Get rid of the world and we will ignore it if you take care of a girl. Jeesh! This time, it is associated with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I have to have someone to put all those lines that cause a truce, man, and there are many. The dialogue is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> They go after the bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play prawns. <br /> <br /> He's squeezing Mari Morrow and impressing the soap. star Sarah Buxton. Cute. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you have some excitement with the July Force, this may be enough. If nothing else, it will help you get your degree in Seagalology.
