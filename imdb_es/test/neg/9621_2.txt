"MirrorMask" was a terribly disappointing movie for me. He had expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and had found favorable reviews compared to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those piles of "style on substance" movies. <br /> <br /> While most children dream of running away from home to join a circus, Helena is a girl who has grown up in a circus (child labor, someone?) who wants to run away to join the real life. Helena wants her mother to die, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a complex of princesses in a fantasy movie for children. The next thing you know is that Helena's mother falls and, for some reason, is suddenly transported to another world. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I felt like I was being transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a pair of sepia-colored glasses with fog. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the showcase of the creatures and the background generated by CGI was interesting, and I liked the Giants in orbit. However, after a few minutes he got too tired and I felt my mind wander ... <br /> <br /> No sense of narrative and clips and MTV style soundtrack (the sphinxes reminded me of Basement Jaxx's "Where's Your Head At"), I did not feel involved in the difficult situation of the protagonist and also frustrated, while we waited for the film to guide us wherever I wanted, hopefully towards the signs of "exit" from the theater ...
