This was the movie of a character. The plot was not so hot when I was there, but the characters were interesting and very well acted. The story centers on the Travis family after the suicide of the eldest son. I say it lightly, because the story is mainly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story centered on him too, they edited the movie rather badly. The acting in all the parts was very good, particularly Emile Hirsch as the surviving and confused son. All the characters were very interesting and I did not care to see them until the end of the movie, when it seemed to drag. <br /> <br /> My big complaint, however, was the story. The son who committed suicide was supposed to be the center of the plot. However, it really was not like that. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went in every way. Then they mentioned that the son committed suicide to remind you that this was the central thread. The other thing was that the great twists of the plot, of which there were many, were never really explained or constructed, but were thrown at random and, often, from the field on the left. To be fair, the ending was very, very good. But it also became clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half (the half that was not padded) was taken out of the story in the Alive song by Pearl Jam. What reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who committed suicide. I could not have been the only one who recognized that the poem was lifted, word for word, from that same song. I do not know, this was a movie for which I had hope, and really, really left the ball.
