This movie is terrible A true hockey fan would have to assume that the people who appeared and produced this film never played or saw a real hockey game. I hope it's a "kid movie", but the only people who will probably enjoy this movie are women between 13 and 17 years old. The hockey scenes are terrible, the defenders play as if they were 5 years old, the goalies are thrown to shots that are 10 feet wide from the net, etc. It is very difficult to predict the end of this movie !! For those who have seen it, who would have guessed it? For those who have not seen it, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> I discovered it less than half the movie. Calling this movie a drama is ridiculous!
