Personally, I really did not win much with THE ACT TO SEE YOUR OWN EYES. I've noticed a lot of very well-rated reviews here for the movie, and I'm a little surprised. Maybe I missed something so other critics felt "moved", but I thought the movie was quite tedious and basically useless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the film is a lot of autopsy images that are filmed in an "Art-house style: many extreme close-ups, strange editions, etc., without sound or dialogue. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the act of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered a study of the human anatomy, or maybe (if you really want to dig a little deeper) some kind of comment on the fragility of humanity or Anyway, but I personally thought it was a lot of semi-interesting autopsy images, but ultimately boring, if that's your thing, then this will be a winner for you. It's not a "bad" movie, since it's not really a "movie" in any traditional sense, I just did not find anything remarkable about it, 4/10.
