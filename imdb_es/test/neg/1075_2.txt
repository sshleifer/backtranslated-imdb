This movie did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought that the stars had such good chemistry in this that they were thrown into the much darker farce, El Gazebo. Frankly, I'm surprised to see all the positive comments of this comedy without grace, ridiculously hatched. Both main characters have the maturity of children of seven years and are much less interesting to pass the time. A veteran supporting cast that includes Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor lends excellent support. And, the beautiful cinematography undoubtedly makes the rich countryside of Spain seem exuberant. And, there are four or five really fun scenes to go with two wise scenes and a lot of recycled and ungraceful garbage. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend It Started With A Kiss.
