This movie is a disaster from start to finish. 75 percent of the film is made of scenes taken from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN poorly edited, along with original scenes that do not add up to anything other than a total scam. I am a big fan of those two films and seeing the scenes taken from them, reedited and folded with a meaningless dialogue made my head spin. This kind of cheap tactics by the producers to earn more money cheating an unsuspecting public basically killed the genre of Sword & Sandal in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene in the new footage and It's Hercules'. With the evil Hercules. The fight is good and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, definitely stands out. He makes a memorable nemesis to Herc. But the rest is a shameful thing that probably got shot in a day. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs!
