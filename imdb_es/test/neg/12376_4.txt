I saw this movie when I was about 12 years old when it came out. I remember that the most terrifying scene was when the great birds ate the men hanging impotently from the parachute from the air. The horror. The horror. <br /> <br /> When I was a kid who went to these cheesy B movies on Saturday afternoons, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-like movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who could be the Daughter of a teacher and happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I did not care much about the romantic angle of the 12 years and the predictable plots. Now I love them for the involuntary humor. <br /> <br /> But, about a year later, I saw Psycho when he came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was beaten early in the movie. . I sat down and I realized at that moment. Since the writers are inventing the story, make it as scary as possible and not with a formula so used. No rules.
