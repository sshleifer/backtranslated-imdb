I've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the beginning. The most seductive of them was the love, innocence and camaraderie shown. Kermit was a role model for deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, although sweet and credible. All the other characters were slightly eccentric, but they showed how different types of beings can coexist in solidarity, respecting the difference of others. <br /> <br /> The following films have kept a bit of the same vibe. However, this "It's a very merry Christmas movie from Muppet" would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to be horny, unpleasant, selfish and cheesy. <br /> <br /> The cast continues to represent God as a carefree corporate boss, with a bad streak. The angels as non-spiritual corporate staff, without thorns, and the movie was so bad that I had to stop seeing. I had bought it for my nephew grandson but, fortunately, I get a preview of everything I give to a child. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film deserved the trash and had no content or social charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame for the people who rewrote the characters and moved away from the original, socially conscious version, centered on Jim Henson's heart. It does a terrible bad service to a man of great heart who is no longer to defend his creations.
