Ugh Unfortunately this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. None of the characters is pleasant remotely, which makes this movie difficult to see. All are miserable children of thirty years who do not take responsibility for their bad lives. I could only spend half an hour of the movie, so there is a possibility that things may improve later, but I doubt it. I can not imagine that five people are as absorbed in themselves as they would be if they could remain friends for ten years. <br /> <br /> Three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relevance to the plot, and it was clearly a free (failed) attempt to bring this film to life boring. <br /> <br /> Save time and money, and skip this movie.
