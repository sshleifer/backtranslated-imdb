From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw some of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried, despite the critics' rating. The basically great guy Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling of Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt of Bully) join to kill a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with her new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are quite baffled by the evidence found in the scene, for example. Unrelated hairs The plan does not seem to be working well because Cassie and Sam have Richard or Justin as suspects pretty quickly, it's just about whether they can get them out of the way. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. GIVES. Al Swanson. Now I can see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murder of a challenge, but this movie does it in a very foolish way, and even a reasonably good Bullock can not save him from being boring and predictable. Suitable!
