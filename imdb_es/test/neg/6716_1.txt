Mr. Seagal has apparently lowered his standards (already low) even more and now he has outdone himself in making bad films. The foreigner does not have any substance in the script. Your director has done an even worse job and the music and the score are so happy and misplaced that you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. Already at 10 minutes of the movie, you just want to turn it off. However, considering Steven Seagal's past films, you think "Hey, there might be some great action sequences that are at least worth seeing ..." ... you're BAD! It only gets worse as the movie progresses. Everyone (with some exceptions) seems to kill all the people they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the film is that it has an ending and has a fairly short execution time. Summarizing the film in two words: STAY AWAY!
