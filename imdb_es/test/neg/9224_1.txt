This is, in fact, a spectacularly bad movie, but it is the rare kind of evil that is infinitely entertaining and surprisingly entertaining. I want to add to the other comments about this movie. <br /> <br /> The "rock band" on the plane looks like three drunks of casual work wearing bad wigs. <br /> <br /> Watch for the serious problem of continuity with the child's tiger plush: he becomes a lion, a leopard and returns again; It is dirty or clean depending on the photo. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The stuffed tiger becomes a real animal to save the child (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The sight of little Jimmy floating around the Amazon in a coffin, grabbing his stuffed tiger and intertwining will permanently keep your memory. <br /> <br /> Listen to one of the most inept sound effects: at the end of the story, when the priest prepares to find Jimmy, the guide demands his monk's clothes as payment: the priest falls on one knee in a moment of resignation and the sound of a bell, not the "BONNNNG" deep of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell of a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute beep to see.
