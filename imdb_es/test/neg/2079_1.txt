This 2.5-hour snore-fest diluted seems to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever. clearly that it has a budget that allows an impressive location in Greece, the money could have been spent better in developing a script consistent with the development of the character and the clearly delineated motivations; especially because Bill has already taken the trouble to do this. The performances lacked passion and direction, leaving the viewer debating whether they should worry about the disappearance of the protagonists. which highlights another point: the main character of the original work, prospero, is not named in this interpretation despite the fact that most of the names of other characters are used. Enchantment and magic are also markedly absent in this particular piece. in fact, all the aspects that made the theatrical version of 'the storm' was full of wonder and intrigue have been completely absorbed by this convoluted version about a self-absorbed pompous ass that can not imagine how to worry about anything beyond the blurring of your wealth and power. above all, a mediocre effort in the best of cases and a brutally poor imitation of the anticipated inspiration.
