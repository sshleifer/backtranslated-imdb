Well, the movie was not terrible, but who created the screen game did not do a good job even creating the essence of unger. This movie was slightly below average and did not correctly tell the story of one of the most interesting people that was born. I suggest reading the book "one of a Kind", the real story of unger. They left out large parts of their lives. Also sometimes they did not understand the real character he was. The real events of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end, they did not really portray the real personality he had. So please do not watch the movie; Read the book. By the way, I'm not just an asshole who feels that you have to keep 100% of the real story, but they did not even come close!
