Yes, it may not be historically accurate (actually, only 6 soldiers of 9th shift died there), and yes, it has some errors and exaggerations (machine gun bent? Come on! Conquered by anyone, an educated Russian officer would know the story much better than that (for example, the British campaign in Afghanistan.) And yes, it has no billionaire special effects Hollywood style, but it is the most important point to show the lives of the soldiers there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are killed in front of their eyes, in my opinion, 9ya really rotates does a good job showing all those things. <br /> <br /> Once again, the film has its weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it seems be one of the strongest Russian movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
