I can not find the words to express how badly I thought this movie was. The initial precept was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was totally horrible. Let's review the main points. Plot - initial good idea but really terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". The ending was surprisingly anticlimactic. Characterization: all the characters were completely soft or grotesque caricatures. I keep trying to think of one that was not, possibly in the mother, but that's all. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateur. Cinematography - doubt you have heard of it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels often really bad. I am totally disconcerted by the score that this movie has had. It's the worst movie I've seen in movies for years, if not ever.
