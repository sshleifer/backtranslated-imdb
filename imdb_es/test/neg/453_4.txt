I'm a big fan of when it comes to the Doctor Who series and I still am, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under 15, or even better under the age of 10, will probably enjoy it the best, and possibly the new fans who have not seen any of the original series, but in regards to the fans of the original series, you will find that this series lacks much of the original series' charm. So great, it took David Tennant to make me appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st season. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this series for people who have not seen much of the original series, people under 15 and EXTREMELY DEAD DURING who the fans are, everyone else will just laugh and mumble curses about Russel T. Davies ruined one of our favorite television shows.
