I think this movie lacks so much substance, that it's not even worth discussing. <br /> <br /> In the first, the package is really unpleasant. Especially the stereotype filming and photographing. Surely, the cinematographic style of Joe Dante was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers", I mean the beautiful and imaginative storytelling of a Spielberg-wunderkind story (I really loved these movies), but in "Homecoming" It was a complete failure The attacks of toy soldiers and furry creatures are simply not comparable to the invasions of zombies (dead, smelly and rotten beings that try to kill the living, without any logical reason, simply because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie movies are characteristics of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to see in Joe Dante's debut. Another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, an awful exploitation of the "big brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and the bad performance. And, by the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor bloody, and even less entertaining. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies in the decade of their birth, in the late 60s / early 70s, used to be revolutionary, provocative (especially through their frightening, explicit content) and social criticism subtle. The original Zombie movie was actually a midnight movie called "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial issues, it's hard to name them all: a visual style of Hitchcock / Raimi, the American lifestyle of the 70s, political reticence, the next advance of the human rights of the Blacks and racism are even more imminent as a result of the side of conservative Americans (remember the filming of the black main character at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies. and to learn more about the most important, I recommend "Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the mainstream". <br /> <br /> So stay away from "Homecoming" and still from the "Land of the Dead".
