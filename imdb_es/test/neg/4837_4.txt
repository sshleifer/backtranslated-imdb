And also a wonderful beginning, a real quick start. It keeps you longing and waiting is about to arrive. Unfortunately, high adrenaline dries quickly, but certainly after half the movie ends. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because this movie has very good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly. But that is also one of its faults. When you explore too many things, you mix with many things, so in the end you are too confused to follow any plot or character. It is very dark and moody, but that does not help much, if it is also a genre jump just to try to fit in anyone, and everything in its history!
