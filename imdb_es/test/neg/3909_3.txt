If you're one of those people who really do not like science fiction because of their sometimes unlikely ideas and surreal world perspectives, it's better to stay away from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It is truly an absurd space adventure, full of eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and absurd twists of plot. In all honesty, I probably would never have minded this movie, if it was not for Gordon's name in the credits. This guy is very close to being a genius in the horror genre, with undeniable milestones such as "From Beyond" and "Re-Animator" in his curriculum. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! The comedy has already been completely completed once (with Re-Animator) but, with the slight difference that the strange humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case of the Space Truckers: most of the gags do not lead anywhere and the totally exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is an occasional funny but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a semi Charles Dance) are always a joy and the still impressive Barbara Crampton has a small role near the end of the film. Crampton was the regular heroine of Stuart Gordon in previous horror films. The history of space truckers is as silly as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-made loner who is fed up with his work. Who would not be when you transport pigs across the galaxy to a company called Interpork? He sees his change to flee while bringing his muse to earth. They float on space pirates and discover that their cargo is destined to take down half of the universe! Stuart Gordon, wisely, returned to horror again after this little adventure. From Space Truckers, he has already made the sublime "King of the Ants" and the absolutely brilliant "Dagon".
