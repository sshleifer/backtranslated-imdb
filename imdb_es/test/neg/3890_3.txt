Before starting, a "small" correction: IMDb states that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Incorrect! I passed him 10 years ago, and he can not be an ant bigger than 165. I'm 183 years old, and he looked like a child next to me. <br /> <br /> It should have been called "Wheat land"; an appropriate title to complement the previous (and much better) movie by Malick "Badlands". This film shows that not all directors have as main objective to entertain. In fact, some of them have as main objective to show the wheat in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing and relatively unflattering, with the obligatory tragic ending. Nothing more than a drama of average and predictable love triangles, with the two male thirds of the triangle that do not survive the movie. Praised for its visual quality; While it has that realistic feel of the 70s, there are limits to how wheat fields can be fascinating. You can photograph them with 1500mm cameras, as far as I'm concerned, but they're still wheat fields. <br /> <br /> Gere, who at first seems like an error as a kind of low-class factory worker turned into Wheatfield -worker, is quite solid, while Brooke Adams seems distant and genial for most of the movie, so one wonders how much he loved either of the two types. But for those looking for a movie that shows all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Richard Gere and other intellectual Hollywood heavyweights, contact me by email.
