Terrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and ends up trapping a mermaid when it is thrown overboard. She catches him to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns, in the lead role, is really a silly person with a tail dangling. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse Who is supposed to be so eccentric, but here we do not see eccentricity. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He would meet with Johns at the very superior "Mary Poppins", 16 years later. <br /> <br /> Miranda causes mischief because two men, a neighbor's girlfriend and the driver (Tomlinson) fall in love with her. <Br /> <br /> Ask any mermaid you see, what is the best tuna, the Chicken of the Sea! Regarding this movie, forget it.
