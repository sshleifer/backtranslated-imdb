In the dusty town of Furlough in Texas, an animal is killing cattle and locals. When they kill teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo), his friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), his Mexican-Mexican boyfriend Miguel González (Gabriel Gutiérrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) find a werewolf Mexican Chupacabra is the murderer and they plan a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "The Mexican werewolf in Texas" is an amateur crap and one of the worst movies I've seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the script is ridiculous, with some of the most terrible lines I've heard. The address does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". The amateur performance seems to be a joke by high school students or a high school play. The "special effects" are horrifying and extremely poor, and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I've seen in my life. Ed Wood's films are cult, but this "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is trash. In the end, Jill says that no man can resist her tits (actually, the most beautiful thing in this movie). But I think the correct quote should be "no man (or woman) can resist seeing this movie until the end". My curiosity impelled me to see how bad a film can be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I think most of the spectators will stop watching with less than 20 minutes in a row. My vote is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican werewolf in Texas")
