EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) "Sequel" forced to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with the presenter of Carell, Evan Baxter, who leaves television to begin his term as a freshman in Congress has his hands full when God (Freeman repeats his sacred role; Jim Carrey rightly avoided the "call") requires that he build an ark like Noah and hilarity occurs (or should have done). The script of the Godforsaken comedy of situations by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only the kind person of Carell transcends his vain Evan in something similar to a human being. The end result is a large number of bird poop gags and a general swelling (which supposedly costs $ 175M for CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously without grace. (Dir: Tom Shadyac)
