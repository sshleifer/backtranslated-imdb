Does anyone remember the THREADS docudrama? It is a dramatic documentary that shocked Great Britain in September 1984. While I was not entirely entertained by the horror movie of the nuclear holocaust of Mick Jackson, I could respect it. Unfortunately, I can not respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later, which deals with terrorists who launch a dirty radioactive bomb in central London. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with him is that the production values ​​of director Daniel Percival are far away. too good when, in fact, this would have benefited from rather low production values. The cinematography is magnificent, but in this kind of speculative drama, do we need an excellent and well-lit Oscar standard cinematography? What we certainly do not need is a musical score, as the survivors of the explosion wobble out of the smoke. Nor do we need vaguely well-known cast members. Someone else sat there wondering "Hey, what was I in? I know that face" several times? I know I did it and it distracts me a lot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production defect of DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to turn it into a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama. In THREADS, the action moves away from the action in Sheffield thousands of times and becomes an edition of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before trimming back the fictional protagonists and THREADS is very effective because of this. Here the information presented asphyxiates the drama that drowns in an expository dialogue and totally unconvincing. The characters in the teleplay game are not really characters, they are just there to inform the audience of what happens when the radioactive material is exploited. It would have been better if the action was reduced to subtitles to transmit this type of information to THREADS. The worst thing is that the director Daniel Percival used the same technique that was seen in THREADS a couple of years ago with his docudrama on smallpox. I should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and declare that, while I do not consider most Muslims to be terrorists, I am getting sick of television productions like LA CELL OF HAMBURG, THE NET AND THE DIRTY WAR had to point this out to me with my head, which is typical of PC attitudes in today's television companies. <br /> <br /> I managed to miss the debate in the studio that Bob mentions here, but I've also heard it elsewhere, and I can not help but think that you can see better than DIRTY WAR with your heated arguments between different factions of the political spectrum. If you remember DIRTY WAR in twenty years (very unlikely that I know) you can be remembered for the discussion that caused more than anything
