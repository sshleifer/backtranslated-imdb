Even a terrible 1 is too much for this movie, everything from the way from start to finish made you tremble. I do not think it's possible to pile up more clich√© moments, in a single piece of mind, numbly wasted the movie. <br /> <br /> Prisoner H's cell block encounters Thunderbirds, demons, even Virgil's expressions were more life-like than his son. <br /> <br /> I have not even finished seeing this and now I am here ... Oh no, the cheesy applause of 3 actors and a backdrop made by a child with an adobe premiere. This is really the end of my "I've started, so I'll finish seeing it" phase. <br /> <br /> Oh, joy, the credits have come to rescue me. (and relax)
