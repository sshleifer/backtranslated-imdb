(Here there are only spoilers of light) <br /> <br /> Stealing Sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about the fool kidnappers, the victims of fools and some other secondary stories released to eat some time. <br /> <br /> You will see some bad performances in this movie. Drama is forced, and humor has no meaning. Whether he is watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who will not shut up, or if the victim's father responds to the death threat of the offender with "Take care of some tea?", None of that is credible. This fits quite comfortably into the "aspiring movie" category. <br /> <br /> You will also hear a repetitive and silly music track for most of the movie. It is quite unprofessional, and does not add anything. It really is just a sad attempt to make a painful and unfunny film seem a bit ingenious. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look beyond all this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you may be entertained. proper argument. <br /> <br /> I have voted 4/10.
