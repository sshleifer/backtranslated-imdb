They gave me this movie and I have to admit that I'm glad I did not pay money for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box looks like a kind of sexual triangle, with 2 Women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from that. <br /> <br /> Actually, the main theme is the victim of a vicious and sadistic violation of the other two characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting. <br /> <br /> Even films like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (in which the box tries to compare this movie) were fascinating, due to the unexpected twists. and suspense. <br /> <br /> But Jaded does not have any of this. It focuses on the rapists and the ill relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the search for a videotape that shows that the story of the victims is true. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> If possible, pass this movie at all costs.
