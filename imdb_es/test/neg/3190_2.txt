I give this piece of Hollywood junk 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next. I can also take a simple stupid comedy and, in fact, sit down and laugh with it. But this movie has nothing to laugh about Or with. <br /> <br /> I like almost every actor in this movie. So I thought I would overlook what many people told me (my fault for not listening). I was mortified by how stupid this script was! Simply ridiculous and not even in a funny way. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw at the movies when they watched other movies or on television. I felt very disappointed and I would really like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then sign up to participate. Bad decision about its parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* MAIN SPORDOR *********** ************* <br /> <br /> Well, this is my most important question in this movie ... If the characters are looking back on this story of Jewel (Liv Tyler ) after the fact ... then, how can Paul Reiser have gone to a therapist who remembers the past? "!?!?!? He dies in the last scene to be crushed by the dump! Can anyone answer me that?!?!?!?!? Big mistake on the part of the filmmakers ... No one noticed from this?!?!?!?!?!?!
