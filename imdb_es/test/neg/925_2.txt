This film is an undisguised attempt to attract a younger demographic group between 14 and 24 years of age, and an insult to all of them. I refuse to believe that this age group is so insipid as to be entertained by this unnecessary "remake". At the beginning of the film, one of the characters proclaims: "I'm surrounded by idiots." This is the defining moment in the movie, which constantly comes down from there. Filled with clichés, "scares" and unexplained events, the film is also full of characters that are not exactly cerebral, a formula too familiar in horror movies. and that shit "is so dark that I can not see" scenes stolen from Chainsaw Massacre but just annoying, without generating tension or horror. It is difficult to film in the dark, and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a movie that is supposed to have tension. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he did not want to wait until morning because he did not care, other than that it might cost him more money to do the night scenes well, or he does not know how. who knows? Unless you've never seen a horror movie in your life, or if you're two or three years old, all aspects of this movie are predictable and done before. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough talk. In general, a blasé film that raises the question: where is the wax? It was treated like a lost leader. if you're as boring as possible and all the other rentals are out or you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, it's not really terrifying, or you'd like to see Paris with a stick in your head, go ahead and take a risk. It's not the Worst movie I've ever seen, but if this is what the producers of this movie think they want a younger audience, I pray they will be fooled. A for-profit film that does not attempt to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. You know, smart characters make a more terrifying movie. I think this is the debut of Collet-Serra as a director, as well as commercials and music videos. He has another one that will be released in 2006 called Goal 2. Let's hope his goal is to make a better movie.
