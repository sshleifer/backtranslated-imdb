When I went to the video rental store to watch a movie, I saw this and immediately thought it would be funny. The image made it look like a kind of classic comedy involving teenagers (like a road trip) that I thought would be worth seeing. When I started the movement, I was disappointed because the jokes were horrible and cheesy. The only thing the director could have thought would be funny was someone slipping on a wet floor. This is not a joke and it would not make people laugh. In fact, I thought about turning this movie in half. I was upset with this movie, since it was just a waste of time and money to rent it. Not enough care was taken in making this film and not enough time and work was spent. I thought the acting was pretty bad too. The only time I laughed was with the "jokes" or the extremely bad actions that really were not funny. I rate this movie 1/10. I hope you found this comment useful.
