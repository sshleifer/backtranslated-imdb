This movie is bad. Simply bad In absolute terms, wrong. <br /> <br /> The dialog box jumps off the screen and hits you in the face with its completely artificial jokes, and then defecates your ability to detect even traces of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Los Angeles, I can attest to that. What is so terrible about intolerance in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It scares you with a look of complicity, or a swallowed word. Until right on the verge of a fistfight, he almost never comes out and says, "Why did he have to be black?" <br /> <br /> I can clearly see that the kidnappers are black, the detective's partner is Hispanic, the prosecutor is white. As long as there is a film rolling through the projector, I can let the images, the music and the words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. The characters get emotional, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. <br /> <br /> That is an association and trust between the filmmaker and the audience. That confidence is violated by this movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie takes you in directions as an audience and guides you with driving directions to a point. This movie hits you with your point and insults you and your intelligence on the way. My unanswered question is, why did we, as a society, collectively say "thank you"?
