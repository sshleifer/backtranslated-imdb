Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after having been swept by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable story, and instead, in its place, is a bland predictability with the obvious attempts of audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a telenovela instead of a gritty indie feature, which is what it should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to find a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping photos of the coast of Rio, etc.) at the expense of a story and fascinating characters. I really did not care what happened to any of the characters in this movie, they were all so two-dimensional. In short, a sad waste of potential that should have been a slam-dunk after the exceptionally inspired CITY OF GOD. Boo!
