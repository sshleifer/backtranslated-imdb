Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who are so upset by their actions that they decide to leave the IRA and run to London < br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is quite disturbing since the lives of young children end in a fireball. This kind of thing happened throughout the 70's and 80's and in the 90's in Northern Ireland, which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING an absolute realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides that he will renounce violence (What? He is a terrorist and has never flown innocent bystanders before). Realism disappears, clichés are produced and ridiculous turns in the plot are produced. Martin is employed by the underground world of London (Do not they have their own assassins?) To commit a blow while he wears a "uniform" IRA (I never knew that the provos wore uniforms) in a cemetery in broad daylight (I would not have a Does the IRA man use a bomb placed under a car?) where he is discovered by a priest who recognizes him while he was in the SAS. Hands up, who thinks I'm lying? I'm not and we're halfway through execution time and there are still several clichés to come <br /> <br /> This all sounds very silly and it is, but what do you expect from a Jack Higgins novel? Everything is cliche, artificial and stereotyped, and the bits that are not are just strangers. Critics killed this movie when it came out, especially saying it could have some potential if the film had Bob Hoskins playing gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates to the SAS priest become a priest and, for once, the critics would have been right. They should also keep in mind that the film could have been less serious if Fallon were played by someone who was able to do an Irish accent. Rourke may be a stocky macho man (Oh, another movie with a super IER), but the accents are not his strong point more than the performance of the characters. To give you an idea of ​​how disappointing the prayer is, the director ended up repudiating it, which is always a bad sign. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, the original release of DEATH PRAYER in Britain was delayed for several months. due to "The bombing of Enniskillen". In November of 1987, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb in the center of Enniskillen, where a parade of the Day of the Remembrance commemorates the British of war took place. Eleven (11) people died and dozens were injured. It was not an accident and nobody left the IRA for that.
