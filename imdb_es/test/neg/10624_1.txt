It's okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will also enjoy. However, there are some funny moments without intention, most of which involve holes in the story. For example, the child needs a piece of the computer to get his father back to normal, and he does not have the money. So, do you ask your father about the mass? No, he kills him and gets caught. Children, if I ever become invisible, I will advance your subsidy, yes? Also, while this child is in the police station (no doubt he will be accused of acting criminally), his beautiful and blonde teacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, and then FINDS THE LITTLE GIRL IN FRONT SCENE TO THE COPS! To make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, they sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh at their achievement. You know, I hate to choose, but the child DID stole something and should face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is a sufficient punishment. Everyone avoids it!
