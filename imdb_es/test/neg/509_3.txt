I saw the 219 minute version and I have to say that dollar for dollar, it's probably one of the worst movies in history. Now I'm NOT saying it's the worst movie in history, but if you look at a cost relation on how much an average person would enjoy, this is a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I would say that the most important factor that makes this a bad movie is the writer / director, Michael Cimino. Rarely can one person be blamed so much. If he had not been so self-indulgent, such a bad movie could easily have been done in about 90 minutes, saving the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that is supposed to be set at Harvard. The scene is huge but completely without context. He has no idea exactly what is happening or knows why the students (in particular, John Hurt) are behaving so rudely. I find it very difficult to imagine a beginning like this in 1870, and it looks much like 1970. This is a half hour in which you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard graduates (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is just a man of the law in the middle of nowhere, and the other one is ... well, WHAT IS John Hurt in the movie ?! He just appears here and there and seems to be an imbecile (the prologue) or a pathetic, senseless drunk who walks with murderers, even though he seems to be against them! His whole character did not make sense. They never explained why it was a Brit who lived in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to accompany the contracted army IF he was so against his evil plan or why he would risk his life for that. a cause I did not believe in at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and his better-defined character made his character more believable, though making him move to Wyoming And risking his life for a prostitute made no sense. <br /> <br /> This reveals the worst aspect of the door of heaven. While the scenes are too long and in need of clipping, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor who has nothing to do with the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other great names are there, but you have no idea why. In fact, apart from Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a prostitute with a heart of gold, a clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, ALL are completely one-dimensional. It is difficult to imagine an EAST movie for a long time when you do not know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant skating rink built in the middle of nowhere in 1890? I am sure that obtaining the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very, very difficult, and yet we are expected to believe that the trains full of skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they had not spent billions of dollars building and frequenting the skating rink, the farmers could have imagined BUYING food and avoiding this war for looted cattle! And what about the boy on roller skates with the violin? What did this have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you have left is that it is a film in which very little actually happens until the big battle at the end of the movie. There are many scenes of filth and nothing flat. So much that, by the time the battle occurs, many members of the audience would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it is inevitable that nothing can save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the final battle, He did reasonably well but had problems. First, this little skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the invasion of D-Day! Second, although the details of the actual events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are somewhat vague, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never there, since both had been hanged BEFORE the battle. Third, I can not believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the movie, especially during the final battle. Although I am far from having a bleeding heart over the rights of animals, their need to use the guts of animals and kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. Seeing and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve the "vision" of Cimino for the film is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the great battle, we have an epilogue. While it is fortunately short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a luxurious yacht, so we can assume that he is finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who seems to be one that Kris looked at a couple of times during the prologue. The most important thing is that nothing is said and you have no idea what the final result is. I read it myself and discovered that the film often misunderstood the facts. <br /> <br /> In general, saying that the film is long and that much more editing is needed, was like saying that World War II was a "little tiff". Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you take into account the production cost, I really think it could be one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a film has This explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as no child COULD sit through this movie (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
