What a waste of precious time! My 5 year old daughter brought this home from my mother's house and we saw it as a family. None of us liked it. This miserable film, full of obvious inconsistencies, open Christian themes and a horrible movie quality, is not worth seeing even in a challenge. It felt a bit like a bad attempt at cinema in high school. How sad it is to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and company) make their way through this trivial and insipid story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The movie should have gone directly to the pound. Avoid this movie: it is better to spend your time watching dry paint.
