First of all, the genre of this film is not comedy, it is rather a drama. <br /> <br /> I had few expectations regarding the film, and even then they did not get to them. As some of the other comments point out, there is good music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music, I suggest you spend your time watching some concert recording with Bon Jovi, or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality time. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you want to see it. A GOOD movie in this genre of rock'n'roll, I recommend "Almost Famous".
