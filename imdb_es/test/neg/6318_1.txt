I was 19 in 1970 when it came out and after having heard how funny it was when it came out and reading the reviews here, I finally rented it and saw it. I did not laugh once, a very funny little movie, and I usually love Reiner. For my life, I can not understand why this looks funny. I did not have a giggle. And I love comedies! Oh, well, at least now I know what the shouting was about. It's not my idea of ​​a comedy. Go rent The Navigator or The Love Nest by Buster Keaton, now those are comedy classics! If you rent this, have a backup rental so that all night is not a loss. Score 3 out of 10
