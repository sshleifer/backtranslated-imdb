... if only Disney had stayed away from that. Look, I think this movie has some potential. Well, the main character's situation does, at least. Take out the whole Jordan Cahill thing and you'll have the beginnings of a decent movie! Of course, you also lose more than half of the movie, but hey, well. It is not a great loss. <br /> <br /> So here it goes: you take a typical, very tasteful, suburban teenager (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends scream a lot, almost always a "pop sensation" "(I guess it's a direct quote from the movie, movies like this almost always involve that particular phrase) called Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a sophisticated individual who is just what TPSTG needs (honestly, I do not care what the real name of the character is, I like the acronym more). The two new friends go to see Jordan Cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the bibs), and come out with his cell phone. The problems occur, and in the end everything goes well. <br /> <br /> If only Disney, or any major film studio, did not have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 years. Or maybe if the 8 to 14 year olds waited a little longer for the films directed to them. It's sugar-coated shit like this that makes me more than a little unsure of who to be more upset with (a little movie called 'High School Musical' comes to mind ...)
