There are many more graphic murders that, in Fulci's true way, are extremely violent and frightening, but even the high level of bleeding does not prevent this from being one of Fulci's poorest efforts. <br /> <br /> As I have When you meet many of your other movies, an understandable story is not exactly on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that left me more than perplexed: why did not Lester eliminate all his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning? Why are all your victims hairy or disfigured? What the hell is the ending about? <br /> <br /> For many, Fulci is one of the 'greats' of horror movies; I do not understand his popularity, finding that most of his films that I've seen so far lack decent narratives and technical competence. Touch of Death certainly does not do anything to change my opinion.
