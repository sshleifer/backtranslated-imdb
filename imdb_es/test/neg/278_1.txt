This was the biggest disappointment of a movie ... :( Chupa, because I really expected it. <br /> <br /> All the turns were shit, ALL were flashbacks !!! <br /> <br /> What makes a good movie of theft is the BELIEF of the work Yes, it has to be surprising for the audience to be stunned, but if you get away and leave, that's bulls #! T ... what sense In addition, the main robbery was an outburst anyway: You could not see the team operating in all its deceptive and brilliant potential! There was not ONE theft in this movie! All were garbage. the break-up shit of the French idiot to go through the lasers ... it's easy to do it when they're composed later! Also, that kind of thing has already been done in at least one other movie ... and it was stupid then ... . <br /> <br /> Also, there's no reason to have even HALF of 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference does half of the I really cast the result of this movie? SCENES do not even need to be there! <br /> <br /> The first one was elegant. This was cheap! And it causes the whole team to lose credibility. Especially the same Ocean for bowing to Bennett.
