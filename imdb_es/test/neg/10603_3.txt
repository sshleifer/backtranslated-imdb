I really wanted to like this movie, but I just could not. It had the potential to be a modern and great remake of a great show, but that's where it came down. It was too modern, too fresh. First, all the great lines and scenes were shown in the preview trailers, which I had seen many times. And the editing was very disjointed, so the scenes did not seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, whom I love as an actress, failed to make way for acting roles beyond high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His slightly stupid style, but really smart, was fun and refreshing. However, in general, I would recommend simply watching the previews instead of watching the movie and wishing it were more.
