loss of 1h45 this nasty little movie is one to avoid, it's like a cheap cross between the sierra and some other recent movies about kidnapping, why the writer wrote this is obvious ... he has no soul and he did it to try and I some money. The turns were obvious, when those who were in danger could escape, they did the obvious and they did not, but the only good thing is that I discovered that there is a new actress that is worth seeing ... list of peyton, do not look at the ferry. There are too many better movies to watch instead of this that will make you feel miserable and think less about the world. Spend your time more wisely, watch good movies, do some exercise, prepare a good meal ... anything, but waste your time in trash like this
