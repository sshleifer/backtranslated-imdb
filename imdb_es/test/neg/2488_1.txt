I was expecting a documentary that covered the science fiction era from 1950 to 1965 and I received a great commercial announcement with leftist political overtones from James Cameron and movie mogul Baby Boomer that drive the works themselves. 'Watch the Skies' has referred in the past to the 'Giant Bug' and 'Space Exploration' movies of the 1950s, including favorites such as "Earth vs. Flying Saucers", "The Otherworldly Thing" and " Forbidden planet "also as" They "," Deadly Mantis "and" Tarantula ". There are examples of lower budgets that are rarely mentioned as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Cosmic Man". <br /> <br /> This would have been a much better documentary if you had interviewed the few actors, directors, specialists and collectors, in addition to the boomer's that was not Hollywood at the time. I just wish there was a "0" rating available since "1" is a lot to generous
