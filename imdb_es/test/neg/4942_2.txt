For a thriller to produce fear, suspense or any emotion, the story must be credible. There is nothing believable or realistic about this movie. The protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn the tables, but manage to ruin it all the time. The antagonists who supposedly plan this and customized their shuttle specifically to catch people, surely left many weapons of improvisation. Actually, there is a scene in which the "smart" girl has a gun in the head of the main bad man and decides to scold him instead of pulling the trigger. This was a completely predictable and brainless "thriller". Each character was one-dimensional. The "victims" were the usual sheep without hearts and without brains that deserved to be sacrificed. Is there anyone on this planet capable of writing an intelligent thriller?
