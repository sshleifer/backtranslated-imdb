This movie is, by far, the worst movie I've seen in my life. A woman "The EX" claims to be a number of people to be able to access her ex-husband. Kill people without reason in the bathrooms to achieve their goal. Women that I think never went to college acting. She just spends the whole movie doing stupid expressions, and seems to be doing everything possible to avoid looking at the camera. Failing in most occasions. She makes friends with the wife and son of her ex-husband, does this to use against her husband. At the beginning, when you see this movie, you think that the "Ex" wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her badly. But, in fact, women are obsessed with man and want him back. The two used to enjoy rude entertainment (using whips, of course). My advice to the general public is that they do not buy this film, do not renten it and do not see it as I did (at 1.15 a.m. on FOX)
