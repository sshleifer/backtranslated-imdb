I have never seen a movie so terrible that it has driven me crazy. It was a great waste of time to see this fucking movie. There are many things I hate about this movie: the songs are so terrible (although a bit catchy) I hit my head on the wall (especially the song "Grandpa is going to sue Santa's pants", which I hit 10 times * shrugs *), the design of the character, and that evil cousin, greedy and evil Mel. <br /> <br /> I can not stand it for a second, it has to be one of the most perverse people you've ever seen. Although I like his southern voice a bit. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake from Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people to observe for the holidays, since it was a great misfortune for Christmas.
