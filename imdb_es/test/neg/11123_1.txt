Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to be classified as one of the most stupidly idiotic movies ever made. I was expecting at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after watching this movie, I can honestly say that I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially. <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just looking at the clock and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that it has just appeared would be an understatement. But at least it did. The rest of the cast seems to have been sent by mail from their respective jobs in the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. Talk about a cast of unknowns! This is the kind of cast that never appears in the movies again. They act as if they had been auditioned while waiting in the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What about the special effects? The store bought firecrackers, styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that seemed to come from my 1980 Atari game. I've seen some horrible special effects in the Sci-Fi Channel movies, but these things seemed cut and pasted made in kindergarten by someone's son. I expected Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob to appear at the end to fight the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all the creature's stories describe him as a small gremlin-like creature. It would have been a good movie for a character like Leprechaun. Instead, we get a giant creature that is shown walking with stop-action acceleration effects that are ridiculous. The chupacabra is in one place and then it is shuffled at full speed down the hall and it is worth laughing just to see this.
