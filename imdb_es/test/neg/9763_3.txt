I loved the beautiful Greek landscape, but the story, which is not something that can be followed anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I can not imagine how anyone watching the movie can control it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they probably wonder why the Australian Allison became the French Anne, and many other seemingly useless changes in the world. history. The mysteries in the book seemed to be cut off or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and I had the same problems with it then, since I had read the book several times. Recently I saw him with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and generally in the movies that I like), I was surprised at how young they were there, Michael Caine and Candace Bergen, but otherwise I could not imagine why one saw him except for the landscape.
