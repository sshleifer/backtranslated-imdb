Recently, I borrowed a copy of this mess from a movie, which took me three sessions in three days. That is another comment in preparation. <br /> <br /> But what I wanted to say first was the carelessness in the special features of the DVD. It included a memory game, which asks the player / spectator to combine pairs of animals to be able to board the ark. However, each time you reveal the chosen animal, the screen asks the player to find (or congratulate the player to find) "is your partner." This is a misspelling, since it should be "your partner" as a possessive pronoun, not a "is" contraction. It is an annoying mistake to repeat every 16 times or more to finish a game. Of course, it is really a children's activity, but it teaches children the wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time. Also, it does not maintain the score, as the amount of movements necessary to solve the game. So there is no lasting value or challenge for it. It's just a feature to include in the package list. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, you could have thought and cared about this "special" feature, just like you could have had more attention and care in this confusing movie
