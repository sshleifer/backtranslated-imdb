Harlan Banks is the thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his wife and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All you have to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately, someone kicks the police and after a hectic car chase, ends up in the slam to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed him and took him there in the first place. Follow a typical action festival. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a raincoat and wearing his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual aikido. The colt and the aikido have always been with him, but the first one I remember with the raincoat is in 'The Foreigner'. It's not particularly impressive, but it adds a bit more to Seagal's lethal arsenal of ballassness. Or cover those extra pounds you're packing. Watch it as you want. His main friend throughout the film is Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and both discover a small conspiracy of bad guys, on both sides of the law, and give each villain what he deserves . <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is that it is painful, and I really mean painfully, not original. Seagal only follows a clock pattern throughout the film and even that becomes increasingly boring as the film progresses. Then it goes from boring to absolutely ridiculous in the final scene, when people who seemed to be dead in killing themselves suddenly, for no reason, start talking. Moaning inducing in every sense of the word. The only really positive thing here is the decent opening: a car chase in Las Vegas complete with police cars and usually entertaining chaos, but after that brief summary you've seen it all before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R: constant violence and profanity
