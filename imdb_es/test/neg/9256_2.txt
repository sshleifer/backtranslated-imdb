Of all the films I could have chosen, it had to be this one. The last time I was in New York I went to a Times Square store and from the hundreds of DVDs that I had, I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) and this, on a double-function DVD that also included Seeds of Sin ( 1968). ) I regretted? Read on to find out. The film begins on an island (near Milligan's house on Staten Island) where two lovers walk along with a huge parasol, apparently made of paper, at a time when he gives her the top of a grass as a gift. Out of nowhere, Colin (Hal Borske), a retarded hunchback appears and kills the two without any reason. After the opening credits to which some of the worst headache-inducing musicians I've ever heard, at least I got used to it since it's constantly being used throughout the film, they introduce us to three couples. The wives are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each receives a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) who requests a meeting so he can read the testament of his late father. Dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in the Crenshaw House of their childhood home and fill it with the "sexual harmony and conjugal love" that they had never known due to the tense relationship between their father and mother. Inform couples that the will is highly irregular but legal. After three days the inheritance will be resolved. Couples are also told about maids, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the late Colin, who welcomes couples by killing and biting pieces of a rabbit in front of them. Later that night, what remains of the dead rabbit is found in one of the beds of the couples with a note that says "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit." This initiates a series of events that end in a gruesome murder and reveals obscure family secrets. <br /> <br /> Co-written, photographed and directed by the talented Andy Milligan. This is an absolutely horrible movie in every possible way. Let's see some of its faults. The music is horrible and painful. Sound, you can barely hear what the characters say and certain scenes have no sound effect and, at certain points, you can hear Milligan shouting commands to his actors, oh, and there is also a constant whistle in the soundtrack. The performance, probably among the worst I've witnessed. The little special effects, Colin stick out to some of the eyes in the opening sequence, is about the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied up and has his stomach open with a saw that looks really awful, like what are the different hands and Legs that are cut. Photograph, Milligan has no idea how to project or shoot a scene, regularly cuts the top, bottom or sides of people's heads and faces, and her camera shakes and shakes as if operated by someone who stumbles constantly. There is also at least one scene so badly planned and filmed that you see a member of the crew. The movie is often so dark that you can not see what's going on. When editing, once again some of the worst I've seen, it seems to cut scenes before they end, cutting while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if there was one, credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (did it take two people to write this?) It's everywhere and it's incredibly stupid. There is an incredibly bad sequence in which the murderer follows a victim to the basement, the killer walks right behind him, at a time when the potential victim turns around. What does the murderer do to avoid being discovered? They hide from him, the murderers are close enough to give the guy oral sex, but he does not notice them, right in front of him. You have to see this sequence to believe it, I still can not believe what I saw. The strange sub-plots simply happen and then disappear completely, check the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-writer Hal Sherwood), which turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with your brother before you get married! A strange scene that is there for no reason. Martha, the reaction of the housekeepers to the first murder, is more upset by the fact that she has thrown out her dinner schedule! Patty and Martha argue over Colin, Patty says "if I had not hit her so hard", Martha responds with sympathy: "You have to do it with Patty, you have to do it!" And do not start to realize how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house! The only good thing that occurs to me is that the costumes seem reasonable, for the period of time that is supposed to be placed. I could probably talk all day about how amateur he is, but I think you understand the idea. One to avoid unless you are a serious masochist! However, I did not regret having bought it or looked for a second!
