First, I would like to apologize for my "1" rating ... The only reason I give this movie such a high rating is that I can not go into negative integers. All the reflections of "This is a parody" to one side, and although I have certainly tried to give it due consideration, they have left me with a certain idea, namely: "This is possibly the worst movie ever made". At any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement ... Seriously, I tried, I'm like in any video distribution film born to worship like the following hobby, but seriously, this movie stung the rhino balls ... . <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had directed this "movie", I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
