Pretty bad sequel made for the classic Roman Polanski television. Rosemary's son, Adrian, has grown up and is embodied by the eerie Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke), a group of witches, again led by Minnie and Roman Castevets, prepare Satan's son for world domination. It is not really fearsome and the light years are less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan worship thriller filled with many songs and many candles, and Ruth Gordon tries to act in a nasty and unpleasant way at the same time. Gordon is the only remnant of the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and a very hammy Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, replacing Sidney Blackmer. Newcomer McHattie is the only real salvation from the movie. It is very off-center and it looks really sinister without even doing anything. Charles Bernstein's music is suitably spooky, but if used excessively, it ends up being intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen, who edited Polanski's previous masterpiece, does not show any style or subtlety at all.
