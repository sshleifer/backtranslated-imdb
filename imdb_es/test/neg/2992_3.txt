It seems that there are many fans of this movie here, but I found it boring, slow, meandering and useless. And I see and enjoy many independent and artistic films, so I did not expect an action movie. He did not sympathize with any of the characters. The country boy was a bad guest and did not seem to be working hard to find a job, and his relative in Istanbul lacked humor and closed emotionally. <br /> <br /> In an interview on the DVD, the director says that the film is about a common situation in Turkey: the person who goes to the field because there is no work and comes to Istanbul and stays with relatives while try to find work. That in itself is interesting, but the movie was not.
