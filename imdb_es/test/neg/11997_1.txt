This movie started really tense when a poor boy is attacked by a group of wild dogs. After a tense pursuit, the grandfather saved him with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> Then we are presented with a series of annoying housemates, including a cake that is always half dressed. During this stage, the movie increases the tension with strange "plinky plinky" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked back at the screen there, where strange creature-like things that go around grunting and killing. A tip: if you ever get caught in your house some fool, get some cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we omitted half of the film, because it was not anything interesting or memorable, Now we are in the surprising conclusion, the last surviving creature fights a "Whip Duel" with the grandfather and his magic whip. I will not say what happens here, but I can say that the battle of whips is full of tension, with aerial fights, two-level fights and all kinds of drama. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to push this movie through the door of a neighbor I do not like.
