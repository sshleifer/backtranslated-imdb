I loved the original, I see it every year. but the second is a piece of garbage and should never have been made. The second could have worked if there was a different location. The son was not an original or even acted like one of Eddie's children. Third he was too smart for Eddie, who played down his father's role. None of the other children was in that. It could just have been much better. I do not know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity since the first movie. I'm going to pretend that this one does not even exist. It is sad that the actors did not even see that they were cheated. A really bad movie. I just think I wasted an hour or more in a bad movie and I really love all the movies in India.
