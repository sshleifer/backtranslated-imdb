This film has the distinction of being the worst movie I've seen in my life, and the only movie I have given a 1 out of 10 in imdb so far. I was tricked into renting it because of the great cover of H.R. Giger in the box. This cover is the only thing in the least of this smoking stack of ... <br /> <br /> These are fraternity boys who fight against "monsters" in a strange world but not in the most interesting post apocalyptic where The cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young people to keep other men in brave-headed fraternity organizations. The most boring performances of boring characters, effects not so special, dismal, landscapes not original and, in general, an extremely poor quality in all aspects of production, make this lemon the loser of all time on my list. <br /> <br /> FINAL GRADE: 1/10 I would like to be able to give you a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
