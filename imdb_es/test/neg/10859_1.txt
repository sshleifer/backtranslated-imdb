I would not recommend it at all. It was like being stuck in the center row of a theater, so I could not leave and see a porn movie in part (except that they did not take off their clothes, it was body language and definitely language). I have to say that I was embarrassed. The filming was very low budget, there was no good dialogue. Yuk The actors stank, except The two best characters that were killed (?) And were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. He pointed to Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who put the dessert in their helicopters. You know what I mean. bla bla bla. The filming was grainy and of very low quality. Nobody liked this movie in that room, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
