Clearly, this movie was made for a new generation that may or may not have had an idea of ​​the work of Charles Bukowski. The autobiographical character of Henry Chinaski in the Bukowski stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 'Barfly' in 1987, also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should see 'Barfly' to see better how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy grease of Bukowski's script and the audacious hopelessness of his solitary hero. The inadvertent humor that springs up in the dark despair of Chinaski's misadventures does not work for Dillon as he did admirably for Rourke, drenched in blood and overweight. The character of Rourke makes the pain and pleasure of the bad behavior of the previous night become a place for another horrible and ugly day in the life of an unknown drunken and misanthropic writer. The character of Dillon misses these marks in favor of a writer of aspirations, handsome and relatively clean appearance that hardly passes at any time in the history of Chinaski. Dunaway's sordid heroine, Wanda, is the perfect complement to Henry, who has never done it. The women in 'Factotum' can not hold a candle before the 'anguished goddess' of Dunaway and the use of a more profane sexual theme in 'Factotum' proves to be more of a distraction than a tip of the hat before the crude and unapologetic of Bukowski Representations of dysfunctional relationships. I was surprised by the number of exact scenes that were used in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei, buying all the things and loading them to the old man is a 'Barfly' scam). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best Bukowski stories in the movie, watch 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (which also carries the title 'Crazy Love').
