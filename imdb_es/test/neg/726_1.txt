I decided to watch this program and try it, but I found it boring and, more importantly, boring ... Bored. <br /> <br /> There is too much sarcasm and the characters are all boring, there is too much conversation and the character Lorelai ... just keeps talking again and again ... During a second look, I felt that I was suffocating the characters, the joke does not work and all love and romance just disappear. It ruins what is already a shit show ... I can not believe that this program has survived beyond the pilot ... This seems to be a program that forces the 'Listen to your parents' line ... There is no real drama ... <br /> <br /> I should have been a pilot ... and a pilot alone ...
