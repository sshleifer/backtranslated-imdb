The prepositional plot was executed in a disconcertingly amateur and inept way, or perhaps several due to the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense and much more are combined with the bovine attempts of charm of Walter Pidgeon to produce a curiosity cinematic to classify with some of the other great failures of Fritz Lang. (I thought that the German ambassador was really played by Lang but apparently not, they could have been twins). If you can not predict the end from several time zones away, you are not alive. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed by so much shit (even with George Sanders and John Carradine, maybe I can clean my mind by looking at Viaggio in Italy instead and for the umpteenth time time). <br /> <br /> Does anyone want a used DVD once? (There may be a movie about the making of this atrocious movie and how many talented people can be wasted).
