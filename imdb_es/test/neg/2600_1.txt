Words can not describe how asinine, juvenile and repetitive is this pile of a series of steam. It is based on 3 things: 1. Constant references to pop culture of the 80s. 2. The tired "lengthens a joke to the point of discomfort," and 3. At least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see that this crap fest is as popular as it is because of the constant references of pop culture that I suppose provoke a "my God! THAT!" Response of the spectator. Writing is beyond laziness, and it pleases its viewers, especially in its 20s and 30s. In addition, there is the character's design, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same boring expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and maybe a different hair line from time to time. Insulting garbage.
