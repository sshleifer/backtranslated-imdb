The only reason I took a look at this movie was to see the "early" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my television guide said it was an "exciting suspense", and was rated with three stars. The qualification must come from the man who wrote this nonsense because the only suspense in this movie was whether it would end or not. Robert Culp reveals what has to be the "disaster" of his career as a policeman who is not even close to being credible. At any given time, EVERYONE is a suspect, including an old and frail woman. If you want to go out deliberately to see a badly written, misdirected, badly acted movie ... then do it. It can make you appreciate the thin films in comparison. I wish I had that hour and thirty-six minutes ago.
