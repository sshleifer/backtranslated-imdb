Your pa tam is one of the worst movies I've seen. But, on the other hand, it is better than most Slovenian films, which are full of depressing characters and stories without brilliant ideas. Your pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moment. In many interviews, director Mitja Okorn tried to tell us that his film is of high quality simply because it did not cost him much money. But thinking that way is wrong. Your pa tam is for my very bad movie. The dialogues are really badly written (90% of the script consists of curses), the characters are stupid stereotyped, the story and its turns are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie is supposedly an action comedy) are very filmed and without any style. Okorn is thinking he is even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he is copying his style in the 90 minutes. The humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks that the constant curse is fun). In my opinion, Tu pa tam is a very cheap movie (not only by budget) with stupid history and very bad interpretation.
