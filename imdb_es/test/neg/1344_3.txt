I have never seen the original version of the film in the 30s, but this new version is one of the worst I've seen in a major production studio in years. Seeing actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once close to level A talents, walking through badly written papers is painful. There did not seem to be any desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that are unrelated to the plot and do not add entertainment value. The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is used as nothing more than a tactic to look modern, she has a lesbian African-American character, but she is really there to look good. There is no real reason why Messing in this movie is more than to complete the number of women in the original version that I take. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotyped female characters, with Mendes portraying the bitch who seeks to rob the rich and bored and a little careless husband and Mazar covering the gossip papers. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, lacks charm, humor or sympathy for any character. It almost seemed that the movie was a punishment for everyone involved, either in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is little hope in the film, however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by darkness. and the dying stars around him is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an incredible talent that brings his extraordinary charm and humor to the film, in the small role it has.
