Movie that I've never seen. Actually it seems to me one of the most entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was good, but for anyone who has seen Hands: Hands of Fate knows that this was not so bad. The monster in the movie looked terrible, they all wore annoying bathing suits, and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they made the monster, they never gave a good reason. The leader woman had to be the skinniest girl I had ever seen. They would have done better if they had chosen the girl who was killed at the beginning as the leader. On the positive side, the dolphins performing was great !!!
