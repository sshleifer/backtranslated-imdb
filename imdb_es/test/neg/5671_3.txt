I will not say that the program is bad, because there are some funny parts, like Spencer, and some random incidents. But aside from that, let's face it, it's just another dry comedy that kids are buying. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan in Drake and Josh. Honestly, she is mediocre at ICarly and is not as funny as she tries to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clich√© that she would think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but it's not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, situations are not realistic, but not all are bad. However, some are annoying. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 years old and have a web program that offers too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF), with little or no publicity, and can still follow talking about their lives without being attacked by lunatics. <br /> 2. Your web show receives too much praise ($ 100,000 per year to advertise shoes, a free trip to Japan, the performance of Plain White Ts, etc.). Honestly, anyone over 6 years old would not find their "comedy" entertaining. <br /> <br /> 3. How is it possible that they are so "normal"? However, they own a three-story loft, Spencer does almost nothing and can still afford many basic luxuries, and has all the equipment for a web program. 4. All adults are idiots. ALL OF THEM. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot-tall girl, no matter how unpleasant and tenacious, may end up with trained cops, unless she is muscular. Sam is skinny and small. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can fall 9 floors in an elevator and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can try to discover criminals better than policemen. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. Actually, it seems harmless, but to make children think they can be hateful to their elders, they live alone in Seattle when they are only 14 years old with an irresponsible imbecile, and giving personal information is wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3 years old, enjoys the show. What happened to the cartoons when I was your age?
