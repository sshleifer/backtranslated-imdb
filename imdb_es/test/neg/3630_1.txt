Blond main character, always believes in everyone and when you stay united, you can do ANYTHING! The best friend of the shy boy with curly hair (Gordo scam) wants to be a film director and is in love with Zoey. The best Spanish friend (Miranda's scam) The strange intelligent girl Quinn (Lary Tudgemen's scam) and the popular actress prepared by Logan (Kate's scam) And Zoey's little brother, Max, annoying (Matt's scam) > <br /> Zoey is the semi-popular girl, with 2 best friends. The only thing missing is the funny sacramic caricature Lizzie Mcguire has, and Hillary Duff was much prettier. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a tooth in a tube top.
