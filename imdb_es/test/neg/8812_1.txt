Why is it that every time I mention this movie to someone, I have to listen to 10 minutes of praise about it? I came to the conclusion that any movie that has a turn in a turn is considered "genius" by anyone who sees it. Is it really what the movie has become? Or is it that every time someone says "Wow, that's great", everyone has to agree with them and they do not have an opinion of their own? How this movie has a rating of 7.5 is a disgrace for the film industry in general. It has also become another film that "needs" two sequels for her, so I'll have to hear about this horrible franchise for a while longer. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie and why. very bad. The original concept is not so bad, since there has not been a good serial killer movie in a while. The writing of this movie is horrible, as is the execution. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse in their attempt to scare us from this killer or just scare us from this movie. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but their talents (whatever they are) are wasted because their character is worthless. Why was he even in this movie? What was all their fight in the end proved useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening. This is, of course, the intention of the filmmakers, but there could not be a better way to do it without making us see all that crap. And then comes the "big" turn (was this the third or the fourth?) And all the audience is surprised and leaves the theater, since this is a kind of masterpiece. Surely the movie makes people talk about the story and what not, but that was not the only flaw in this movie. The management tried to be too creative with what it was working on, and the flashback sequences were used simply as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, come back and review the movie and you will soon understand why it is not worth the praise it receives. For an incredible movie of serial killers, check out Se7en if you have not already done so. That's what this movie wanted to be. I've gotten more arguments about this movie than probably any other and I'll continue arguing against it. Please, do not support this franchise not only for your sake, but also for mine and for everyone else. Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make, instead of 1,000 remakes, sequels and "shock" factor movies (like this one). Oh, yes, the line in Sierra 2 looks really promising: "Oh, yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet!! Blood, that must mean it's good, right? Give me a break. I am sorry to everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, a flashy address and a bad performance do not make a good movie.
