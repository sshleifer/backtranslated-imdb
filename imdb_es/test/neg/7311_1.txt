This movie was bad. I think Elton (or is Mike) Wong starred. Anyway, it was the Wong who did not have that silly smile and looks more evil. He plays a man who receives a blow to the head and suffers brain damage. He recovers and avenges himself. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this movie, but he can not do much. But what little it does seems to make others pale in comparison. In addition, the film has a rubber hawk that controls the Wong boy. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
