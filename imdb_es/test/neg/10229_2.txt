Also titled -> The magic castle -> This is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another line of the story that has almost nothing to do with the game or swan lake? Only some rockbart friends, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (no voices left). Deployed to its bars, this is a continuation of a thread. The next thing you know is that some bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born. Fortunately, although the chapters are supposedly closed and this will start, but the trilogy finished badly will come to an end.
