In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a film that ended in many of the best critics lists for when the year's summaries were published in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and gave the main star John Travolta his second big hit in so many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi lens. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on the wise Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to enter the film business. I, for my part, was completely captured by the different characters and the clear dialogue of the original. So much so, that when I heard that there was going to be a sequel, it seemed that I stopped feeling the usual tremors that occur when a studio tries to repeat what was a good idea ten years later. The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, is directed this time by F. Gary Gray, whose Italian work in 2003 was one of the highest grossing films of the year. Combine that with the cast that now expands to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods, and you have all the ingredients of a great continuation in the exploits of one of the most interesting characters of the 1990s. On this occasion, when Chili (Travolta) leaves the film business, he feels disappointed in himself and the industry for participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film. Thanks in small part to his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chili decides to investigate the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first leads to the famous club Viper, where Chili meets singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian), who as a leader of a rookie trio can sing melodies like Whitney Houston (ie, Whitney before Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packets of sugar). Linda has a contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with her overly apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plans to ensure that Linda completes the last five years of her contract, even if that means putting Chili on ice. So with Linda's future at stake, Chili weaves an interesting network that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), the Russian mafia, the police, the Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler and a bunch of furious weapons. pointing Woo-Wheee! That sounds exciting. So, why was not it? Be Cool tries too much, well, be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart or soul. Instead, Be Cool feels like it was directed by a Saturday Night Live producer, as there are individual scenes or skits that are not chained in a whole movie. Take, for example, the scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, while Black Eyed Peas plays live in the background. The scene is forced and should have ended on the floor of the cutting room. Instead, it is coupled between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with a real push. The Aerosmith concert and the trip from The Rock to a boot shop are also excellent examples of individual moments that do not represent a great movie when they are organized. But those are not the only problems with the sequel, that could probably be changed the name of Product Placement with the amount of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi that seem to look at you more intensely than the serious look of Chili. The story contains almost all imaginable stereotypes and each one has enough screen time to become something offensive or shameful. Whether it's the gangsta retinue or the muscular gay who has a poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone movie on the wall, no character is above offering us something we have not seen many times and in much better movies. With the magic almost eliminated from the first movie, we ended up with an inferior product that is the second movie in the last six months (Ocean's 13 is the other) that puts a lot of stars in a marquee to end up like a movie that no actor would bring to an open hearing. Be Cool was a big disappointment. I wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I ended up with a film in which the shots must have been a gas, but the experience left me with a bad smell.
