Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It started as new, exciting and fresh. And I liked it very much then. Kagome was a good female model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and daring. <br /> <br /> Then, it kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed ... and I'll tell you why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT!) <br /> <br /> Well, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome from the beginning, by reviving her dead 50-year-old girlfriend, who is drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> They present a pervert named Miroku, who is supposed to be a kind of religious figure for the show. (What really bothered me, because it was out of place and stupid.) Then, they present a demon killer named Sango, whose sole purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his brother with brainwashing. <br /> <br /> The great evil of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad boy, lost his touch after a while. (It got old pretty quickly.) And it bothered me that he was the only villain in the program who did anything.) <br /> <br /> The characters turned wooden, and without emotion. And then, the end of this terrible series was a disappointment for any fan of the anime. Nothing happened. Naraku was never killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fell completely in love (because he was still in love with his dead 50-year-old chick). The holes in the plot were left open. The animation got worse as the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged him over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected me (and other program fans) to be satisfied? I was disenchanted, disgusted and annoying like shit. At least I had high hopes that the series would have a good ending. Instead, all I got was a commercial for the manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about swords and things like that, I recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". That program advances and goes somewhere, and also has a really good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this simple excuse for anime, the best you can.
