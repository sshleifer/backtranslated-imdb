This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Usually, I can sit through a Van Damme movie if necessary, since they are usually a bit laughter and do not require much reflection. This has no redemption characteristics. <br /> <br /> It has a clear lack of plot, humor, acting, direction, etc. A smelly real on all levels. <br /> <br /> I have never left a movie theater during a movie, although I came very close to here. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
