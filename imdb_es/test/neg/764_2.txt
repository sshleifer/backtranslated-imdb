My God, the things that went through entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> This is * not * the "Tom and Jerry" that you may have enjoyed on Saturday mornings, with an unfortunate cat and an intelligent mouse. This is a much older animated series, with a couple of Mutt-and-Jeff clones that get into several scratches that result in any of the typical gazes of the dancing skeleton type that formed much of the initial animation. <Br /> <br /> This particularly vile excursion, apparently originally designed as a vehicle for a couple of real comedians of the time, has the couple crashing into the ocean while flying to Africa, which requires a black face makeup , exaggerated The "black" dialect and the situations of "Feets, do not fail me now". <br /> <br /> It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film, the American vision of the Africans had not advanced much. On the other hand, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.
