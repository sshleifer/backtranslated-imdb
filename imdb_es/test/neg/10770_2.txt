I do not know why they even kept the name. How could they call the series 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' after they deviated so much from the novels, they would have no idea. The names of the characters are the only things they kept, and even then they changed some of them, mixed them and changed Percy's relationships with them. The truth is that I only watched about two hours at the most, but that was enough to realize that the series was not at all like the Baroness Orzcy who had portrayed her characters, and who probably would have been rolling in her grave when I was filming and ventilation. Poor lady I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie / series from the book, I will not ruin it as completely as this series did.
