It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I only saw "The Courage of the Doctor of Crime" until the end. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects, each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot without character development or narration. I guess it's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments in which it looks and feels as if this were before the Second World War, but perhaps it is due to the writer's background in the radio programs. <br /> <br /> The "Doctor of Crime" is the detective who is visiting California for a bit of R & R from his practice of psychiatry on the East Coast. He hooks up with a mysterious novelist friend with whom it is implied that he has been present during one or more previous mysteries to resolve capers. The novelist occasionally plays the role of a companion for our detective (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with some comic relief (sort of). <br /> <br /> There is also something simpler, but the police captain is not so clumsy that he is sometimes annoyed by the meddlesome detective. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and a sister who are dance artists in a nightclub. The dance is a kind of interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments that look more like the 30s than the 40s. Although the location of the story is California, the Braggas seem to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was an element of the plot that managed to keep me entertained, but I will not divulge more than that because I always enjoy the movies more when the story is discovered, instead of knowing it in advance. (Although I can think of many, many, B movies that would qualify higher and it's hard to say that watching this is a time well spent) I have not seen any other movie in the "Crime Doctor" series, so I can not make comparisons.
