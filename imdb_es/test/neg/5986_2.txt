I lived next to the author in 1980, when he moved to Portland from Downer's Grove, Illinois, with two of his high school classmates. He seemed a pretty normal guy, although he had many artistic pretensions. After a few years, he jumped into Portland's post-punk music scene with his friend Phil and a few others, and a band that definitely was not going anywhere, though it gave him a lot of action, including an affair with Courtney Love in it. . Days of the portland groupie. He seemed to think that his musical perspectives were good enough to move to San Francisco, then N.Y.C. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to hear that he got a publishing contract in '95 after the band crashed and burned. The name of Courtney Love seemed to be the deciding factor. I have no idea how the film came about, especially with this cast, but I doubt that Gus Van Sant was involved. Anyway, the critics here do not seem to be sure if the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so I'd just say that this is the work of a pretty smart guy who wants to be a writer, artist or something, but not He does it. I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without the Benzedrine.
