The only good thing about this movie is that they managed to link it with Part One! But aside from that, it was one of the worst movies in history! The only time you see the Ghoulies is in a flashback (and the flashback is only clips from Part One)! YOU MUST NOT SEE! In one to ten, "Ghoulies 4" gets a One!
