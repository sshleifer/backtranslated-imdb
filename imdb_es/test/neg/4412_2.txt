The son of Native Chief is unjustly accused of the death of his father. The evil witch doctor orders him to execute him. Then it returns like a killer tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "movie"? If it was intended to be a horror movie, obviously there was some kind of bad judgment. And for a comedy, it's still not funny enough. I do not know why people make movies like this. I guess you have to be in a really silly mood to see it. Or maybe you want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "a slow death". Or maybe you want to see the excellent acting skills of everyone involved. (Mrs. Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and the script, which were strangely ignored at the Academy Awards that year. <br /> <br /> "Should not we try psychoanalysis on that tree? Maybe her mother feared oaks." 2/10
