In & Out made me want to throw up. I've never seen such a shameless movie! Seriously I wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyful, but you have no idea how to say it. For me this was not a comedy, unless the cruel and sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls in love with it. <br /> <br /> From what I saw, this movie had four (4) main flaws that started with (A) Matt Dillion's character announcing to the world that he is a former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay No matter how amazing it is that Matt Dillion's character won an Oscar for what seemed to be a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why would he say such a thing? After all, this was never a problem with Howard's students, his friends, his family or his family. No one. So why would he say something like that when it was not true? More specifically, why does not the film give us an answer as to why it was said? The reason is because there is NO response, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. The second (B) defect is in the fact that the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is: attraction and sexual intercourse with members of the same sex. In this film, being gay is based on liking the musicals of Barbara Streisand and being passionate about literature. Everything is based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> These two flaws are again in that graduation ceremony that must be seen to be believed. Matt Dillion learns of the commotion that is taking place in that small town and the film seems ready to let us know what made him say that. When he arrives at the ceremony, he does not say anything, and I wondered why the hell he got there. He did not solve anything. Then, when all the attendees stood up to announce that they were homosexuals, I was so excited I wanted to vomit! Those people defended that Howard was gay making fun of all those stereotypes. What the movie forgot is that he was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. The filmmakers have just shot themselves in the foot! But wait, there is more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (C) Howard appeared to be on trial to lose his job as a teacher, because people believed that it would influence his students to be homosexual. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit, and that he would not influence their students. But did not we see the character of Tom Selleck pressing Howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, so that he came out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to go out? From that, the film clearly shows that homosexuals are capable of recruiting. The movie, again, then shoots on the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the script shut him up for the rest of the movie? I only counted three lines I had after: "Yes!" to his parents, "Hi!" to a student, and "Are you ready?" Tom Selleck before the last scene of vomiting. It may be that he is low one at a time, but the point is that he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide that he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never believed, for once, that he was gay. <br /> <br /> As bonuses, the film also includes several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard is asking advice from a priest in confession about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sexual relations with his fiancé. "Does that make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied "Oh, yes, he is definitely gay". UH Huh. Or what about the scene in which all the old women gather to tell Howard's mother that she does not have to be sad about her son's deep and dark secret because, well ... they all have them. Then, one of the ladies confessed that she had never seen "The Bridges of Madison County". Funny? Do not! If the film shows that he is insensitive and has no idea how unpleasant it can be for the family, one of its members has announced that he is gay. I know. I have several friends who are homosexual, and none of their families took it well at all. That was a bad way to spread the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw for me was the last scene that implied that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera moved slowly towards the front of the church when ... It was not what you thought! That point had displeased me completely and I could never forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against movies about being gay or homosexual. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "In & Out" simply screams for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​corruption at its core. What I got from the movie is that if you are 99% heterosexual and 1% gay, that is, if you have any doubts, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It's like homosexuality is becoming a dominant feature in genetics. Actually, if everyone told you again and again that you were useless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, would not you? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, in fact. This was a seriously ill and cruel movie, the WORST of 1997.
