Although I have rarely flown myself, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has been added to the precious material of laughter in the aviation cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is the captain doing the ground checks? Why do you even measure the oil levels in the engines? With response times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY does Captain KICK against the plane get tired? Strange type of pressure control. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western aircraft, with two engines built since the 1980s have a crew of 2 people . Now try to guess how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter manages to fly next to the crippled passenger plane. It must be quick ... and the words of the captain to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are really fun! <br /> <br /> 5. With the elevator rudders stopped it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. It happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the speed of loss. <br /> <br /> 6. The elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the commercial aircraft, it is most likely that you have cut the hydraulic lines and, therefore, have disabled them for the direction, but would NOT fix them in a certain position. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the aft kitchen was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the fire extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who has been trained to do it. The flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the elevators of the aircraft would have been in a neutral position. The movie could have ended here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cabin) has three bars in his uniform. Actually, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain cut the carcass of the cabin with an ax to examine the damage behind it? I thought that it would have been the duty of the flight engineer, since he is supposed to perform technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. On any aircraft, there is no unused space. At least, commercial aircraft can not afford a compartment that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on ... but at last I laughed hysterically about how screenwriters imagine plane disasters. ! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters occur in such a short period of time that you simply can not make 90-minute movies. But you can always fill 90 minutes with foolish and crazy minds, regardless of gender.
