Who the hell is responsible for this terrible mutilation of one of my favorite books? This is simply terrible. Terrible acting, terrible script. History is not even close to your old self, and what were you thinking? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This really defies the description. I do not see this. Seriously, do not do it. Not even for laughter. Especially not if you're a fan of the book. This could be the worst film adaptation of the story: everything is broken and disjointed, the characters that are important to understand the sequence of events are severely marginalized, and any potentially interesting location of the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New York ) on something deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book, it is basically a fictional biography about a writer who is growing, exploring his writings and so on. Her mother writes an autobiography that is hailed (despite her protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, attractive and long. His prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, is about Robin Williams, once again, who tells us to take advantage of the day.
