Seymour Cassel offers a great performance, a tour de force. His performance as the supposed duke of the beach, Duke Slusarski, will always have a place in my heart. The film focuses on a nerd who has just arrived on the beach hoping to honor the dreams of his dead brother. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Boys cheating, guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole city of Los Angeles on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman. The next time my wife answers, I'll pretend that I'm hitting the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the film becomes a good drama, since the first half of the movie really did not make sense. Duke plays a wonderful volleyball game, the best he has played in over ten years. The way the scene is filmed is beautiful. You can feel the heart that this man has for the game and the love for being on the beach. Those five minutes will come down as one of my all-time favorites. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was scarce.
