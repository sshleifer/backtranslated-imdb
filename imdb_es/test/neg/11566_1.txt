In fact it was horrible. The main girl who is topless was obviously sleeping with the director at that time. It was filmed in a warehouse that was probably owned by family or friends. They also chose not to bother to invent a story. Of course, these are ways to reduce costs, but are they smart ways to keep costs down? No, they are not. At a minimum, they could have found a high school student in a "creative writing" course. These children may have had at least one lesson on the structure of the story. At the very least, they might have read something about the structure of 3 acts, but acting, obviously, was not a priority either. Seeing these idiots running in funny clothes that was stupid by the standards of the 1980s was a shame. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in the humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution that this film received. If the actors had really seen the end result of their hard work, there would be a line of people waiting to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this film 10/10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all. This movie should be shown to film students everywhere. It's better than 90% of the student films I've seen and wow this movie is a piece of shiiiit.
