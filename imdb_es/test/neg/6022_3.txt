This movie was an absolute waste of time. It's just a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings do not sympathize with the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you're looking for something else to do, because the movie is that boring, since you already know what's going to happen. The other half of the time you're desperately waiting for the protagonist to grow a couple of balls or just end his life jumping off a bridge or something. In addition, the secondary characters are for the most part one-dimensional. There is no depth for any of the characters in this movie! There is no depth!
