This is the movie that, more or less, sounded the death sentence for the author in Hollywood. With more than 40 million dollars, Heaven's Gate is so ill-conceived and executed that it would take a lifetime to bring down all areas of failure. What really bothers me the most is that, technically, it is very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that came in. John Hurt's opening speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino intended this as a "style". He did not do it. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well drawn, except for the four or five derivations; In the climate battle scene, it is difficult to know who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. Even at that level, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the lady of the city is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character a fraud. The performance is generally rigid, without any range or depth of feeling; Even Christopher Walken is bad. The character of John Hurt is the only one with a certain arrogance or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, playing a fresh-faced Harvard graduate with bags under his eyes is evidently ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I suppose saying that it's too long is an exaggeration. The roller skating sequence could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is quickly becoming a clich√© for the film, and the final scene aboard the ocean liner is outside the Twilight Zone. Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just saw, would have been the perfect ending. Actually, those scenes in themselves are not bad, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he has given us as the "flesh" of the image is so incompetent. The editing is poor, especially at the climax of the great battle. At one point, the same explosion with the same car wheel that flies from the explosion is used three different times. I would like to be able to say something, anything, well about this movie: a great scene, a great performance, even a memorable line of dialogue, but I can not. Everything is just a great profane disaster. The only thing I liked was the cinematography and the places in Montana, which are impressive. Even Cimino could not ruin that. This is a long, boring and bad movie by all standards. And people who say that they have hit themselves only because of the excessive cost are fooling themselves. 1/2 * of 4
