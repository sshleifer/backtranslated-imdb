Jerk hazer Mike (David Zelina playing this college fraternity man as one of the great bastards you want to see die right away) and his college friends leave the diabetic hypoglycemic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hanging on a wooden cross together with this scarecrow, which is a legendary ghost story. They get a PO on Sam, who essentially goes into shock and points a punch at Mike who falls on his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon), so leaving the poor man hanging is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow that comes from the cross to destroy all those who left the poor man to rot. Mike and the gang send the uninitiated fools to take down Sam, but they are the first to receive a sword that swings on their throats. Mike and his gang head to the beach to drink alcohol, play volleyball and discuss until the scarecrow arrives to finish their little evening. Sam's surrogate brother, Jack (Matthew Linhardt), is supposed to take care of him, but decides to sleep with a new love interest, Beth (Samantha Aisling). Then, when he receives a message from Mike on the cell phone about how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were on the beach basking in the sun and sand, Jack goes crazy with fear. Beth's separated father is a doctor and agrees to see Sam's condition after the nearly-dead youth was cut off and taken to the emergency hospital. Returning to the beach to face Mike because of his negligence (not to mention Jack's promise to train Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, in terms of not making hazing), Jack and Beth will face the same assassin full of straw that is throwing others. Coach Ramsey, who was part of an incident of hazing in the past that went wrong and caused damage to the killer scarecrow, has to face some demons while informing the survivors of the group about what they are up against. <br /> <br /> Girls, breasts and blood ... this movie follows the basic guidelines of Slasher. However, this film also has the characteristic features of the corny characters, acting, dialogue and general plot. The film shows signs that its budget is low, especially in violence, since most of the real actions are done off the screen instead of showing them as happening, close and personal. What appears on the screen is mainly the consequence of the assassin's revenge: a fellow with his guts, another with a stake (holding the group's volleyball net) sank into his chest, splashing blood after a woman receives a blow to the head, presumably with a large rock, a chick lying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc. There are also some dubbing problems in which it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not match the movements of their lips ... especially the unintentional hilarious sequence in which Ed (Travis Parker), aspiring rock star , he is singing to his friends a horrible song that everyone seems quite impressed.
