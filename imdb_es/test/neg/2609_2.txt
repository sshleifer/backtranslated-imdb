When I was a kid, I never understood WHY someone would see this horrible show. It was pretty stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to suffer some kind of fatal accident (they were SO INCREDIBLE). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude about cartoons. Although I still think it was a complete shit, this is only in relation to the American version of the program. That's because I was reading a book about anime and discovered that the programs we saw growing up were completely different from what was originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent, so they eliminated this from the episodes. It's bad enough, but what they did was incredible: actually, they cut the episodes and put them together to create programs that were NOT ANYTHING like the originals. For example, an episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really do not know if the original program was really bad, it could have been brilliant. But who can say it, considering that all we have to see is this Americanized mess?
