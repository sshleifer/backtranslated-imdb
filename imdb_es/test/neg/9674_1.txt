This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst subject of the biblical movie in history ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They have described Lot as a friend of Noah, although he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, Lot later became a pirate and attacked Noah's Ark during the flood. And what about the merchant who comes on a boat that moves on water with a bicycle mechanism? And does he trade alcohol for food and water, and then show Noah as an alcoholic? Teasing, and continuous blasphemies one after another, and it goes on and on and on ... The filmmaker and all the participants surely secured the first row in hell with this trash ... <br /> <br /> Please, Stay out of this shit, because you'll save almost three hours of your life.
