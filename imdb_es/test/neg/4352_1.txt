This is the slowest "black film" movie I've seen. The very weak scripts only provide the opportunity for Jack Palance and Rod Steiger to perform exceptionally well, lines that were made for a working audition. Palance and Steiger claim that they are serious actors who can represent their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, mainly in a living room. Obviously, the director moved the actors in rhythmic circles while emitting exhaustively long lines, to prevent the slow rhythm from becoming visible to the public. The action does not begin until the last ten minutes of the movie. If you are one of those who seek more depth in a criminal drama, this is not for you!
