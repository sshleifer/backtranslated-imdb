This movie is one of the worst remakes I've seen in my life! The performance is ridiculous and Corman has not improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of special effects are removed from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). It makes Piranha II: The Spawning look like it belongs on the list of the American Film Institute.
