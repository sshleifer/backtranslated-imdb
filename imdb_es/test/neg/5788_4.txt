Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be court-martialed for doing whatever he wanted. You may be right, but that is how the SEALs really are. I served for several months with a SEAL team in Norfolk, VA. Actually, I must say that they used our ship to deploy throughout Europe for a couple of months. I was the mail clerk on board and every day these guys tried to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day, we issued a pass to one person. Each day a different SEAL arose that pretended to be someone else. Well, after the third time I told them not until I had proof of who they were. They were NUTS! I thought they were going to burst my cage, they choked me and then they stole my mail. Luckily, I had not only the President at my side (The Navy), but also the Federal Government (United States Post Office). That was the only time I saw that the SEALs stopped having what they wanted. They were allowed an unlimited land permit, where we had to return to the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEALs only had a week of detention on the ship, while a sailor was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine store and got a court martial. Is it any wonder that the retention rate of the SEAL is greater than 85%? As a SEAL, you are god. So this movie does a pretty precise job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks ... unfortunately, it's so unbelievable to normal people that it's fake.
