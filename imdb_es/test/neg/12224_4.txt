RKO was trying to improve her star JOAN FONTAINE when they considered her a flying nurse who is strong enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to an agreement with running away from the responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM transmitted it as a springboard in the career of Joan Fontaine. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is sincere and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is fine as his love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared the best turnover with Fontaine. What happened to this handsome actor? Why did not RKO promote it, along with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian. <br /> <br /> These are the thoughts that went through my head as I watched this somewhat lukewarm drama that never lived up to the promise of its title. The story itself is quite boring, only occasionally comes alive due to Fontaine's energetic heroine. <br /> <br /> She photographs herself beautifully as the nurse and skillfully uses her serious expressions, suggesting that there will be more in the future. date. Beal never had a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. Strictly no shine. <br /> <br /> But, what happened to Philip Huston? The evidence here is that he should have had a valuable film career. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: Watch for Dwight Frye (from "Dracula") as the out-of-control patient aboard the plane.
