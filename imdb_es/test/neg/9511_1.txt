One of the joys of Shakespeare is that there can be no definitive performances, no performance can be "correct", but some may be wrong, and this one is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that can not be dispensed with: 1. His indecision and inability to take any kind of action. For God's sake, that's what makes the play last as long as it does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead at the end of the first act. Any production should try to explain why Hamlet delays, why he is unable to act. 2. Your sexual disgust. His total disgust at the idea of ​​what his mother and uncle lay in bed fill him with a total disgust for all sexual things and this means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet vomits. So, what does Mel Gibson give us? Lustful man of action. You could not stray further from the character of Hamlet if you tried. There are many ways in which Hamlet can be played, but this is not one of them! What I do not understand is that they managed to get actors so good for the other parts: Claudio, Polonio, etc., why could not they find one to play Hamlet too? Mark Rylance in the part would have made this a great movie. East? Mel Gibson, whoever he is, completely disappointed the rest of the cast. And let's be honest, Hamlet without the prince really does not work.
