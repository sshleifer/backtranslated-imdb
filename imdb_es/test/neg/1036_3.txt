As much as I tried, I just could not get into this. Maybe it was the washed tones; maybe it was the extended approach - I'm not sure, but although this was not a "bad" movie, it did not really seem like an "effective" movie (words that I understand are much more arbitrary than their common uses). <br /> <br /> So, basically, the agreement here is that a series of deaths of male adolescents triggers an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, which triggers a witch hunt. What does the death of the children have to do with the mysterious and sexy woman who appeared in the city? Is the crazy hermit involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of criminal drama and horror, since the diverse inhabitants of the town are all suspects and the corpses continue appearing while a bloody violence takes place. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but for me, most of it fell a little flat. Oh, he had his moments ... the only child who walked in a beautiful nude seductress was pretty good, and the scene in which the parents beat the hermit was a bitter comment (even if the effects themselves failed, considering that his skin seemed peel off as if they were whipping her with hot irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I've already put spoiler labels in this revision, but BE CAREFUL, HERE IS THE GREAT SPOILER: I do not think so. I do not believe that a priest can convince himself to kill young children by becoming sexually aware without a hint that psychosis appeared earlier, with other children, with a story or some other personal effect. The movie really did not win its end. FINAL SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> However, Fulci is a great name and I am more than certain that there is an audience for this. I definitely need to see more of what he has done, because this may have been a bad introduction. Anyway, most Italian giallo is successful, so I'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before discarding it. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
