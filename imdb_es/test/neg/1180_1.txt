What a waste of time to see this movie. Bad image quality, bad sound, bad performance and, definitely, it is not based on real events. The "bride" of the deputy made too many exaggerations, like the sheriff, which was more comedy than horror. The officer tries to make an emergency phone call dialing 911 ... PROBLEM ... in 1957 that emergency number did not exist. That is just one example of obvious inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "frightening" aspect was little known. I just did not find it horrible. <br /> <br /> I thought that the actor who plays Gein did the most admirable actor work of the whole movie. I could see mental disturbances in his interpretation of the character. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry ... this one does not get it !!
