This movie has to be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I liked was using the Argento-esquire lighting in most of the scenes. The music is horrible and the pace is so slow that you can see it at 2 times the speed and it would still be slow. The story does not exist. It does not even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it is not. It is a kind of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you like that kind of thing and you can stand the slow rhythm, then look at it, but I prefer to recommend something Japanese (for example, Ichi the Killer) I think the only reason why this film was never in the theaters is because of fear of audience collective suicide caused by the great amount of boredom generated by this movie. These 80 minutes of its duration would have been better spent seeing the painting dry. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 simply because there is not a 0 in the drop-down menu
