Spoiler with explanation of the plot: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of the war between the evil man (who appears out of nowhere, and without questions ...) who went crazy, and Casper, the nice ghost that deals with revenge for his death. With each film of frames it becomes increasingly predictable, a big disappointment. Putting an end to the seams is completely silly, it has nothing to do with the movie itself, I think someone runs out of ideas or just gets to the point where the movie is so one way or another, so it could also have a stupid ending. Loss of time, resources and money. The actor's game is very poor. If you think about the dialogues, you may discover that the family conflict is applied artificially by poor communication between the characters. Some scenes are sewn randomly. In short: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Lost of time and money.
