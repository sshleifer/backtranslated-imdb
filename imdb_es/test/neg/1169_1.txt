I own a vacation home on a lake, not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be exact. I have seen his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he dug, and I bought at the hardware store that once belonged to the Worden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. That was disgusting. The real story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and creepy, because the creators of this piece of junk decided to invent their own story surpasses me. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small man, meek and shy. That is part of what makes his story so terrifying. I did not have an assistant to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mainly sand with a little dirt. You will not break much sweat by digging a hole. They did not have to hire an actor with the physique of a fighter, they only investigated. And if the writing was not bad enough, there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure 911 was not available in 1957.
