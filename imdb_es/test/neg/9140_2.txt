I am a big fan of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is not good. The critic shown below is completely correct, since the stunning images of the Detroit station are the first and last memorable scene of the film. After that, I really wish I had gone, instead of continuing to offer hope throughout the movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt disappointed. <br /> <br /> The score is almost a repetition of the previous two, not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stands out as being cool. However, it was good enough to probably still review the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But keep this in mind if you watch this movie: if you realize at some point that you are not enjoying it, go ahead and divide, you will not lose anything, because it will not improve. <br /> <br /> I'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): many shots of athletes that look good enough for a Nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably boring frontal shots of puppets Wax of famous people (WTF, were you thinking here?!?), some laughing babies (cuuuuute), some "Photoshop effects", some images that purport to suggest a comparison between water flows, information, money and people (I think ) ... and then a lot of quick scenes unrelated to massive violence ... and then a lot of stock footage. <br /> <br /> I could redo this movie in 10 seconds. Here is my presentation: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy dad with a shaved head and lycra shorts on a bicycle playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with a rope; 5 seconds of that scene in "Red", where man talks about messing with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows, money flows"; 1 second of Reginald Denny being twisted with a brick, and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean bouncing on the moon. <br /> <br /> Here you go, that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life that I just saved. Of course, I would get a copy of After Effects and apply one or two filters, so it would not look as brazen as it is. If Steven Soderbergh is reading this, I will not need a lot of money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "Life as War", I suggest "Bowling for Columbine" instead. He may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's funny.
