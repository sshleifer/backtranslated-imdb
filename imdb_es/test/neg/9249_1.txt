The acting is awkward and spooky, and not in a good way ... at all. The writing, dialogue and chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense and each close-up of the expression or reaction of an actor lasts 3 or 4 seconds, which seems like a Mexican telenovela. Everything about writing is not realistic, and all the actors involved do it much worse with their interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this? To use the word cheesy to describe this Canadian disaster would be the underestimation of the century. Did the director even see the final cut before it was put on the air?
