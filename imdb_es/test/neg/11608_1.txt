This film is about pathetic, spoiled and ego-motivated winners who think they have something interesting to say, played by pathetic, spoiled and ego-driven winners who think they are interesting. Directly from the coke-filled sewers of the artistic scene of New York's incestuous artistic drama. <br /> <br /> How many spectators are tricked into thinking that this carries any substance, remains a mystery to me. Maybe secretly wish to belong also to this 'guild of actors' too paid and overestimated or maybe have never seen a decent movie? <br /> <br /> Get out, put your hands on the dirty land and get a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real weapon.
