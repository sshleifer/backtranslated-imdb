This is a pretty bad movie, but hey, this movie is not as bad as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a bad movie in terms of your writing, direction, acting and basically everything in between. It has a story so weak, simple and ridiculous that, in addition, has little to do with the previous entries of the film Ghoulies. Try to connect the movie with the first movie "Ghoulies", from 1985, but, on the other hand, if you really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors, would it be the Ghoulies in this movie? Instead, we now have some small people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, disguised as demons. It is not that the Ghoulies of the previous films were classic characters, but that, nevertheless, they were the heart and soul of the film and also gave the movies a certain amount of fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything else you can imagine because it was put together by people who obviously are not the most talented in your business . As in the director Jim Wynorski's resume, with films like "The Witches of Breastwick" and its sequel, "Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade," "House on Hooter Hill," "Scream Queen Hot Tub Party," " The Bare Wench "Project" and the sequels "The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless" and "The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain" and "The Da Vinci Coed". <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is pretty silly and corny, but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it a little more entertainment value. You know, it's the kind of cheap looking movie with some special effects, costumes, makeup and actors little known since then. <br /> <br /> It is still not the worst movie of the series due to the reason why "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is, by far, a much worse movie, since that had some horrible attempts at humor, this movie, at least, still makes some attempts to be serious and pr Ofessional, although the final result is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Creation of bad films and may only be visible to those who have seen previous Ghoulies entries. <br /> <br /> 3/10
