After some faults, we are still waiting for THE French horror film that the critics will no doubt revile, but they will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline can not be accused of not being knowledgeable about the genre (he is an editor of a high class fantasy label, he has worked for the legendary magazine Starfix), but why a scenario that EVERY clich√© uses in the book (except perhaps the Odious comic relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even the winks to Argento fail. It is not even a Euro-adolescent film like the German "Anatomy", much better, only a compilation of scenes that hardly seems to have any relation with the other and presents MANY plot holes. All the "Celtic" aspect is hardly touched. And, after a painfully predictable "revenge", the script offers us a boring and endless pursuit in an underground necropolis that seems bigger than the Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother would not do it. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but in vain I looked for it.
