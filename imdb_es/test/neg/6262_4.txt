I never expected too much from a movie by the evil film director B, Jim Wynorski: a silly premise, some cheap effects and some nudity from some busty girls, and I'm usually quite happy. <br /> <br /> Well, Cheerleader Massacre complies with the first and definitely the second, but unfortunately it is a bit light when it comes to splash. And when a movie has the word "massacre" in the title, and it skimps in the blood, then in Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's cinema focuses on a group of cheerleaders who, along with their master mini-bus driver and a couple of boys, get stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm. They go on foot to a desert mountain retreat, where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! From the beginning, good old Jim makes sure that his film shows many scenes loaded with T & A, and includes the obligatory shower scene, along with many other moments in which tasty women become nekkid (including a point of unbridled sex) of softcore and three very free). -babes-in-a-whirlpool tub). None of the women looks young enough to be cheerleaders (and they do not even see them in their outfits), but who cares about those details when they are very willing to undress in the name of art? <br /> <br /> I do care, however, about the many lackluster deaths of the film. With such a tremendously creepy title, I had been waiting for some inventive blood to flow with all the vagabonds, shrubs, and breasts; instead, virtually all murders occur off the screen or appear almost without bleeding. Only a silly post-decapitation scene (achieved with low-cost CGI) approaches the delivery of the goods. <br /> <br /> Still, if you feel like some excitement, or a little silliness silliness minus the grue, then, at 82 minutes, at least Cheerleader Massacre will not be a waste of time.
