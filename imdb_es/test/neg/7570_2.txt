This has to be one of the most scripted movies I've seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but made with your snake-shaped monster puppet instead of an elegant creation by Ray Harryhausen. Combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and performance level of The Creeping Terror and you'll have an idea of ​​what this movie is like. <br /> <br /> The film is dubbed, although by the original actors (I think the movie was originally dubbed in Italian for the audiences of that country, then it was republished for the US release), which it makes the movie look strange ... the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, just do not match properly with the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving correctly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... has certainly come a long way from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the ones where there was a lot of excellent movies. Add this to your other science fiction movies (Panic in the Year Zero, X The Man with X-Ray Eyes) and you can see a good actor fallen in Boris Karloff's syndrome ... Stuck making really bad horror movies in foreign countries just for work.
