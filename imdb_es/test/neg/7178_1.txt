Yes. It takes a Norwegian to ruin and sacrifice two great books and a concept that would work well in a movie: this movie is really the worst Swedish movie of all time. I hated him so much that I even considered abandoning him, something I had never done before. But it was so horrible that it was almost convincing. I just had to sit to the end. As in some Stallone action reels of the early '80s, this REALLY takes the Swedish action to the stone age. So full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes is almost fun, but who could see something good in the terrible performance, the survival of Mark Hamill in a minefield or the action silly, useless and irrational? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: are we not finished with the clocks marking the zero, the hero escaping just in time and two friends become enemies in the end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And one more thing: the placement of the product in this movie is incredible. While other countries have understood that it should not be so OBVIOUS, the Swedish film industry apparently has not understood at all: is it enough to look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open a window? O or o ... this movie really makes me angry.
