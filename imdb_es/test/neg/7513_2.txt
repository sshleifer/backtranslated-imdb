This is a polarizing film. People love him or despise him, it seems. I, I despise it. The film comes from the same context as Oh Lucky Man by Lindsay Anderson, but while it's a masterpiece, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Both films interpret the unfinished novel of Kafka: America, for its inspiration and general ideal. America is a surrealist story of a young man's travels across the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, one that does not change in the course of the trip (although the book has approximately 300 pages and still seems to have finished a quarter, so we will never know). Allow Kafka to focus and comment on absurd / surreal situations and environments. Oh Lucky Man follows this same template to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell and Weekend does the same for France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also hugely Brechtian, and they use various tricks and techniques to point out the fact that this is NOT REAL, this is conspiracy, etc. But the difference is that Oh Lucky Man uses the movie built to convey the absurdity of life and the class system, Weekend uses the movie built to kill us with an ideological polemic. Because Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two main characters in which we have no investment. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we can not worry less about them. Deliberately so. But by doing this, Godard leaves us a film that deals completely with his own message, which in the first half of the film is provided through implacable and dominant symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to the camera. . Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes, such as the really horrible murder of pigs, much worse than any of the violence outside the camera of automobile crashes. <br /> <br /> The end result is like listening to a student in political dress droning and over and over again about his views while repeatedly kicking you in the head to get the message. The problem with Brecht is that if you alienate the audience too much, then you have pushed it away from what you are trying to convey. What always seemed obvious to me. <br /> <br /> However, the parts that really remain on the trail of this film are the contrast between the extremely explicit and sexual verbal description of the trio at the beginning and the outside of the screen. The comic violation in the middle, which, even if it could be seen as allegorical, completely destroys the faith of the film itself and its characters, the little that existed in the first place. It's so French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> Instead, look at Oh Lucky Man. That's a work of genius. The weekend is a job of pretension. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and only for the bottling scene and the piano scene, which are only indications of genius, although in reality they make the final result more frustrating and unsatisfactory than without it. them, this is a bad movie of the worst pretentious director in the world, with them, well, it's obvious that this is a very good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious movie in the world. Somehow that is much worse.
