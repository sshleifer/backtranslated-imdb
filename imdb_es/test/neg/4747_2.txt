Beginning where the last AVP was stopped, an extraterrestrial "weapons hunter" emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spacecraft, and causes the Predator spacecraft to crash into modern-day Gunnison Colorado, where several more aliens are bred. wreak havoc. The Predator race sends a highly experienced and armed solitary Predator to "clean up the mess". Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is the rhythm. This movie moves too fast. The opening credits just roll and the Predator ship crashes into Earth after the Alien reaches its maximum intensity, a character of hunter and son is presented, but before we learn their names, both died, then we see the Predator . The home world and the main Predator fly to fight against the Alien infestation, and all this happens in the first five minutes. This unnatural rhythm does not stop throughout the movie; the National Guard arrives in the city, but in two minutes all are killed without even having a good view of the face of one, the manager of a pizzeria gets a character development scene that will only be eliminated the next time we see it . Once again, without even knowing their name, random thugs, a cafeteria waitress and a chef are murdered again without knowing their names. At one time, our main characters are at home, the next one running through the city, the next at a gun shop, the next at an APC, and this random set jumping over and over again does not let the audience have time to settle down by leaving them holding straws. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the configuration and the time frame. The film is set in the current Gunnison Colorado. All other Alien and Predator films were shot in fascinating environments, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zones, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes AVP-R, located in a small modern city in the United States, with a series of "highlights" that include a sporting goods store, parking lots, pizzerias and rooms for little girls. I mean, were you really trying to make the movie look as boring, monotonous and uninteresting as possible? It is difficult to perceive these monsters as terrifying creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside of the girls' dormitories. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem with this movie. The Alien series was established in the future, no human had heard of an Alien before the first film, and the Aliens not only had never been on Earth, but if they ever reached Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This movie ruins the whole concept by settling in the modern day, with the average Joes watching the aliens everywhere, and at the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, it does not even suffer what might be considered minor losses. It pisses on all that concept of the other movies. The attempts to maintain continuity are made with the massive Deus Ex Machina's. The Predator simply carries a bottle of unlimited blue magic liquid to melt any body with a single drop, the army at the end of the film takes too drastic measures and throws a nuclear warhead that simply conveniently erases all evidence of the existence of Aliens to Despite the fact that there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more failed attempts are made to fill the gaps in the plot. <br /> <br /> Also, for a Movie "Verses", it has a relentless bias in favor of the Predators. For most of the movie, a lone Predator manages to kill dozens, if not dozens of dozens of aliens, all in the mêlée range while barely earning a single scratch, while the aliens simply kill to the right and center like doves. of clay, just waiting for his turn to be killed by the Predator without making any effort to defend himself. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", as it should be "Predator Aliens Massacre". I mean, how can you make two species fight against suspense and tension, when one is represented as far superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are among the biggest faults. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters in the previous Alien and Predator films, but, even as an independent film, they are bland, sad, and sometimes even cruel. The characters in this movie consist of No joke, horny couples who want to lie down, pizza delivery boys, blond bimbos, high school bullies, kids and a flagrant copy-and-paste job swindling Ripley and Newt; The worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all the characters mentioned are played by teenagers. While teen casting is an obvious attempt to attract younger audiences, its only effect is to make the film look and feel like a typical teen porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how Give a convincing presentation. , with them mostly with completely blank facial expressions delivering a monotonous dialogue. Not only this, but these characters do some of the things with the greatest cinematographic delay in history, such as using Predator guns, commenting on the powers when they have been for hours, following the stupid plans to leave the city instead of simply leaving the city. Quickly, and so many other idiocies that the film actually had the audience in my cinema sighing in frustration. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is just a horrible B movie, something that it deserves directly on DVD. category. The fact that this movie was a theatrical premiere amazes me, since every part of the film is amateur work.
