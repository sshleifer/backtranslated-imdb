The movie did not make sense to me at all. Good actors (favorite SergioCastellittoparticular, it was great in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but that was done by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director in opposition to the mediocre who made this effort), but horrible, rambling script, terrible editing, and a director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say, and finished without saying exactly anything. A lot of waste, but the kind of film that certain Italian pseudo-intellectuals whom I had the misfortune of having met in the dark and distant past would have loved, and unfortunately Italy does not have a monopoly on these, can be found in all parts and probably acclaims this as a great masterpiece. I never thought much about Bellochio as director. I remember seeing his first movie "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or a similar title) in Rome when he first showed for about 50 years (he was living at that time). All the usual pseudos commented on it, but it left me quite cold. I did not think he was a great director then, and still is not. Age certainly has not improved, and this movie must be one of the worst.
