I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly written and badly performed echo from the people I know. <br /> <br /> Big moments between characters? Including many of the scenes of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares together? they were often ruined by long and tedious monologues that forced the actors to stumble. Beautiful and ill-adapted phrases moved away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah in his pulpit of beer boxes. <br /> <br /> When watching a movie with Maori actors, I discovered that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth I struggled to find a key character that would sound for the full two hours. Plus ?? Including Wiremu and Peka ?? I ended up saying or doing things that I did not understand and with which I could not connect. At the end of the film, the writer had managed to alienate the audience in which the Maori could not relate to her and, therefore, Pakeha was granted the license to dismiss her. My feeling is that the message of the movies? Or at least the main one of several that were thrown to the audience? It is important enough to avoid the use of character limbs. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to give this advice. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and, as irritating as that horrible "bing-bong" noise that they tied through 'Eyes Wide Shut'. The audience was not so subtly automatic to laugh, cry or get angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entrance music in Star Wars: obvious and slightly funny. <br /> <br /> I think there are some people who could enjoy this movie. It's fun in parts, has a good amount of action and has some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also did jobs. However, in general, I did not enjoy the experience as much as I know I should have. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, The Island of Dr Moreau and Crooked Earth seem to be Tem's shitty quartet.
