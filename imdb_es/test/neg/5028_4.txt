Will there be an end to propaganda films that deal with social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay, "Care" is about childabuse, "Care" is about perverts who misuse children in a school and how disgusting it can be, if it is a film with a poor script and with bad actors played, it's still a bad movie. "Beware" is a movie that could have been, but it is because it was a movie that I do not know, but everything seemed so limited that it appears as a cheap movie that will be seen by some housewives and parents who decide not to do it. go to bed. There are so many things unanswered in this movie ... the relationship with his mother, for example, or the death of a battered child from whom we do not know anything else. "Careful" should have been much better.
