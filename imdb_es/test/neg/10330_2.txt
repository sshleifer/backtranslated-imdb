Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ... But this movie was so horrible, I could not help but laugh throughout the movie in disbelief that I was really seeing something so horrible. LOL. The audio editing is horrible, they try too hard to create creative camera angles. Because they are weird and stupid. The script stunk. Acting was horrible, the story is not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20-year movie ... so I'll give it an extra point for that. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And sending these things is a nuisance ... minimum of 10 lines ... bother. Well, now I know why I could not find this movie in the movie store ... I had to buy it offline to see it ... well, it only cost $ .58 cents ... although the shipping was $ 2.59. Oh, well ... I do not recommend anyone waste their time and money watching this movie ...
