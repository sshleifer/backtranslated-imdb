A better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and the film does well to give an idea of ​​the suffering of people, especially children, but in general it is less like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extraordinary. It should be observed to get a rough idea of ​​what the war did to the children of Bosnia. If one expects a great and exciting film, Welcome ... it will be a disappointment.
