This movie was absolutely and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so pretentious and pretentious that in the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not write reviews, but I was surprised. The number of positive comments received. While I admit that the performance was good in some parts, the script's shortcomings far outweighed the decent performance. The only reason I saw this was because some of my friends were watching it, presenting it as probably the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed in the least. His only salvation is that it contained my new favorite collection line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to enter my Pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to enter your mind, your heart, your soul. I do not see you wearing pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> In general, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I've seen that was taken seriously.
