Another boring boredom of Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive in these big bloated blockbusters that take more than two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The centers of history in Inman (a Jude law in sleepwalking), which is going to the Civil War and has just started a kind of romance with Nicole Kidman, a daughter of the preacher who ends to get to the beautiful city photographed. The story moves back and forth between Inman's trials and the tribulations in the war (ie, guess what boys and girls? HELL!) And Kidman's trials and tribulations at home (which are, very predictably , incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get back in shape after Papi, the saint of Kidman, dies of an uncomfortable illness. Zellwegger acts as blunt and bossy as Granny Clampett, dispensing enough of Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of Touched By An Angel's strongest observer. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply unbearable. Avoid it as the big bloated nonsense of Bogus's pretentious literary adaptation without meaning it is.
