Apparently, the film is based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, since 1927. Not that I've heard of it before, but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and miniseries. The first film premiered in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best-known creations. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a new and promising European actress who would conquer Hollywood. However, now he has returned to movies like this. There is nothing wrong with playing in French quality films, as it is the country of origin, but this movie is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is mainly that the film is based on its special effects, to make the film good and terrifying. . Well, horror and special effects have never really been a good combination, with some exceptions here and there. It's not that special effects are bad in this case. Especially for a European film it is simply good, but it is badly placed, since the film gave the impression that it could have done easily without its effect. It would have made the movie better and more terrifying to watch, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> The movie is not always tense or attractive to watch, also because the film seems to have a hard time choosing the right approach. Sometimes, the film chooses a light and less serious approach, while in others it clearly tries to be a terrifying horror movie. This is mainly the reason why the movie simply does not work at any level. You can say that the movie is a bit boring. Everything also definitely gets worse towards the end. After a while, just stop worrying about this movie and its story and start wishing it had decided to see something else instead. <br /> <br /> The edition seems totally incorrect. He uses cuts that are too fast, without much style, while the quick edit obviously intended to give the film a good, modern style. Also, the timeline simply gets messed up sometimes, as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The musical score is also really annoying and, sometimes, it does not even sound to fit the Film, as if everything had been written down before the film was finished filming. I can not believe that the composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-nominated composer. The musical score is almost as annoying as the film because of its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of many characters, of which, however, they do not care. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau will fall in love with a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The movie also features Julie Christie, which is nice but does not add much to the movie. <br /> <br /> A horrible clock. <br /> <br /> 3/10
