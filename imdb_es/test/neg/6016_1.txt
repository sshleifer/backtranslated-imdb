I wish all the fake documentaries and horror parodies go away. If you're going to investigate loch ness ... do it for real. Enough of bull ****. The same goes for horror and science fiction ... if you're going to make a movie and it's supposed to be scary ... make it scary ... not fun. I hate watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for his life (or running or whatever ... his life is at stake) and they are making jokes. This never happens ... where have all the good directors gone? I think that terror and science fiction have really gone through the air since the 70s. I long for the days when a horror movie was terrifying ... all this "scary movie" shit is for the birds. This movie is also for the birds. If you really want to see a good research or talk seriously ... do not wait for it in this video.
