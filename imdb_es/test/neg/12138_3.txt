IN THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU CAN FIND SOME SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know what is the point in UP IN THE VILLA, one piece beautiful but of little depth, one of those created with the only objective of obtaining Oscar nominations for best costume design and artistic direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of vintage pieces produced each year: a beautiful and intelligent woman who tries to find love in a strange place for her. She has many difficulties, but finally finds her happiness in the arms of a man who is not with whom she had an achievement. In this case, our lady is in Florence, a time before the Second World War. She is an English widow committed to a rich but old man (whom, obviously, she does not love). One day he meets another man, who does not have a good reputation but who he falls in love with. Of course, there is her friend who will help her for better or for worse and a third man, who commits suicide here, in the lady's room, preparing a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP IN THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I was always interested in the story, but I never got excited. The problem is not the slow rhythm, but the script. Adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. Every time you think the story will heat up, it will cool down again. If you think there is a conspiracy involving the Florence police chief, well, there is, but it does not change almost anything in the story. It just goes on and on, until the predictable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. If it's a little bland, it never gets boring and too sentimental. The performance is half and half, but surely it convinces. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad decisions after THE ENGLISH PATIENT (the romantic drama saaaaaaappy THE HORSE WHISPERER and the boring / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP IN THE VILLA is undoubtedly better than those pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, even if his character is a big guy. Anne Bancroft is an excellent actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she does not let her character become ridiculous. Now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is incredibly annoying!). <br /> <br /> The address is good, but not bold. It was interesting to know that the director is the same as ANGELS AND INSECTS (also starring Kristin Scott Thomas), another drama of the time, but bolder than this. What matters here are the visuals. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the stage, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but, of course, it could have been much better. It's visible and interesting, but do not expect a thriller, it's not! This film fails a little because it wants to have some mystery, something to contemplate ... However, there is not much to say, mainly because of the superficial script. Now, about Oscar nominations, do not worry, I'll probably get them.
