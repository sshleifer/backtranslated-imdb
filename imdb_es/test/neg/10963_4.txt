The fast and the undead is, finally, the first film to make his own history null and void. It is, essentially, a gigantic hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the acting was pretty bad, the motivations of the characters did not exist or they were incredible and there was not a single character that was worth it. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a protagonist of a dark horse) was annihilated halfway through the proceedings. <br /> <br /> What the Fast and the Undead DOES serve is an excellent example of how to do good. color-timing It seemed excellent, when budget considerations are taken into account. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it develops as if a man had seized a hundred of the greats and observed some westerns (in particular, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then simply threw a lot of items at randomly in a movie ... "You know, they have movies where the characters do THIS, does it fit in here? No, but who cares, they do in other movies, so I should do it here!" <br /> <br /> Maybe a good view for filmmakers and growing colorists (freshman film students). Otherwise, a must.
