This movie is so horrible that it's funny, not quite at the levels of hilarity of Troll 2, but nonetheless it's funny. The acting is horrible, the music is atrocious and the story does not make any blind sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a horrible grandma costume who killed a group of people at a party. The scenes of death are so badly done that they are hilarious. A girl is repeatedly stabbed in the chest, but she does not scream, she does not try or defend herself, she does not run away. She also manages to remain standing despite being repeatedly stabbed. Another scene of death that involves a string is also extremely hilarious. No thought seems to have been put into the plot. Granny seems to magically move from one area to another (for example, being hidden under the leaves in a forest where the victim simply stops, appears in front of someone although he had been behind them ten seconds before), people kiss extremely Inappropriate moments (would you stop and kiss someone if you were chased by a homicidal maniac) and the double twist at the end is absolutely ridiculous? It seems that he was thrown only to confuse people. I would recommend people to watch this movie if they love horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but do not see it if they are expecting a scary horror movie, they will be disappointed.
