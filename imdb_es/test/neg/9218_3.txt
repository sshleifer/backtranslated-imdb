One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew something more about them than miracles and Judgment Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for the spectators interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy; there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and fat characters in the pubs. <br /> <br /> In reality, good candidates for a true Third Testament have been published several times, such as "A Course in Miracles" or "Conversations with God." All have new twists and angles for Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but the number of people who have bothered to vote. In four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this movie. As usual, enthusiasts are the most anxious. For comparison, take a look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - original 1973 version.
