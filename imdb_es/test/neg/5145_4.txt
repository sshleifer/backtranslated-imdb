This well-intentioned film is a bit short, and unfortunately in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful, with views of north-central Vermont that provide the setting for this mid-century tale. The Quebec bill strives to return to its whiskey past to save its farm. <br /> <br /> Between scenes of magical realism and direct action, this film rarely reaches its rhythm. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill seems quite forced, or else his lines are; or its cross of accents Yankee and Quebecois. Anyway, he ends up as a hard low-key blow. However, his dialogues with the character of Gary Farmer's Coville shine. The Kinneson rat by William Sanderson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows some real potential as the young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene and he never steals it. Luis Guzm√°n appears on Lake Memphramagog (with an excellent performance by Lake Willoughby) as a monk with a bell accent: who knows? And then there's Bujold's Cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels Yoda while singing lines like "Will you marry a woman from Quebec!"?!? Just too weird and nothing enigmatic enough. <br /> <br /> The ending really gets choppy. Again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete. And Yoda never provides an answer that we can understand.
