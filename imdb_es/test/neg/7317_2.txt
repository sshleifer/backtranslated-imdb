This is a typical comedy of the university and it is very normal. The story is fine but it is not very entertaining. It's about an unfortunate guy named Reno who loses his job, he gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar. However, he has a girlfriend (a pretty one by the way. :-). Anyway, this guy gives him his mansion in Los Angeles and Mercedes as inheritance and soon Reno and his girlfriend move to Los Angeles to this new house. The problem is that they would need some roommates to pay the high rent for this house and that is how the film develops ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts well and has some funny jokes here and there, but suddenly , the film takes a direct turn to hell ... The ending is BAD. Very bad. Destroy everything about the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
