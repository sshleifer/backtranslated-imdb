Emotionally insecure Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life has apparently been sleeping with all the men he knows; this shocking revelation dismisses poor Tom from his rocking chair, and proceeds to avenge himself bloody from the men he thinks have been chasing his old lady. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really bad movies can often be both fun and really good, and no movie that shows a beheading by a ceiling fan with a machete should be considered completely useless; but although Killing Spree occasionally manages to entertain himself with his inventiveness and his cheap and cheerful gore, I found that the terrible direction, the horrible production values, the ugly cinematography, the muffled sound, the frightening illumination, the stunned mind and the silly narration (which includes the awkward twist of the plot that was telegraphed from the beginning, plus a zombie ending without meaning), the nasty score of the synthesizer, the inane dialogue and the completely amateur performance served to make this effort of the writer / director Tom Ritter an almost joyless experience.
