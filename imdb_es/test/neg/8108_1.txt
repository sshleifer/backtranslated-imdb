No spoiler is needed to get away from this ... well, quirky movie. Canada becomes part of the United States. IN AGREEMENT. So, I think I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the United States. Stupid of me. Continue with this movie and you will go to cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the movie in which (trust me) you will not mind a squat position for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South should be among the most imaginative series in history. But in this case, Paul Gross, I regret to say, had no idea of ​​making a coherent film and squandered many talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
