This movie was trying something, but it failed miserably. All attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tricks and weary plots that I ended up laughing and making fun of all the way. At least I entertained. <br /> <br /> The ghosts try to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I did not mind remembering? And what was it with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell short. And where the hell did that guy come from (the character of John Corbett)? He simply enters from nowhere in a vast field. And why did he suddenly lose it again when the crows arrived? And if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if that made him try to kill the family? Has no sense. So many things in this movie just do not make sense, and the acting is not very pretty on the part of the girl's main character. It's not terrible, just a little like his days of children's movies. <br /> <br /> So, overall, this movie was not brilliant, but I had a great time tearing it, and sometimes that's all a horror movie should do. It is rented for non-quality entertainment.
