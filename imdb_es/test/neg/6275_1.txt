After seeing Steven Spielberg's version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I was hooked on the subject. I could remember my favorite parts in the movie, people vaporize, people panic, fire, explosions, everything was so great ... <br /> <br /> So a few weeks later I entered my store videos. and I see David Michael Latt's version of War Of The Worlds on the shelf. "It could not have reached DVD, so fast, right?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell, instead. "Oh, I remember it from The Outsiders!" So I thought, it could have been an attempt. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, very wrong. As soon as I saw the initial credits, I saw them take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this movie and that's how it was. The whole movie reeked like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. From acting, special effects (stupid-looking tripod things, when people vaporize become orange skeletons) and, above all, they do not even come close to being as interesting as Spielberg's version, in fact, the plot was boring, and only 3 scenes of destruction were left! What the hell? I ended up so bored, that I had to fast-forward through the movie until I found something that seemed even remotely interesting. And nothing was really. <br /> <br /> My advice: do not even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away. Spielberg's version is about to end this month, buy it! But please, please, I beg you! Stay away from this turd before it drowns us all!
