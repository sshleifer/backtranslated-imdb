This movie is nothing but Christian propaganda. It started as a good science fiction movie and then integrates a meloso Christian theme in the story that has no relation. I had to turn it off halfway because I felt cheated to rent it. The Catholic Church has officially announced that extraterrestrials DO NOT contradict belief in God. <br /> <br /> The movie is slightly entertaining despite this, but the dialogue is amazing, the writing and acting are mostly garbage and, in general, this movie is mostly a bad thing that should be avoid. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the filmmakers did some research on the phenomenon, but then you quickly realize that it only has the purpose of discrediting and injecting their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting topic. If you are a fanatical religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
