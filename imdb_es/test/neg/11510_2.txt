The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching Kim Possible's movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing. It's one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they come and go with lines like "Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something". When I saw it, I thought it would be another fake imitation of Disney's Lizzie Maguire. But I had no idea how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I went for about 3 weeks, when my sister turned on the TV. Naturally, Sadie was on. What I saw had to be one of the funniest shows without any intention I've seen. Come you? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian tree lover, is incredibly ill, obsessive with Owen's monotone and poor performance. For some reason, her friend Margret decides that Owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he looks. What exactly do these tests imply? Well, one thing they do is put a cockroach in their notebook. Why? So she can be apprehensive and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to take it away. How is this a test? Because if you crush it, it is bad and indifferent and does not believe that bugs, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals". SEPARATE DISEASE AND PESTILANCE! They deserve to be crushed! But, of course, Owen just cleans it out the window, and Sadie is still in love. But that is not all! Margret says she needs to be challenged once again, in something that "no man can pass." This consists of pushing scarves through his pants (yes, you read well) and walking, buy it to see if he notices his big butts. As expected, he does not notice, and we see Sadie in her strange and strange portable world. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, to form a family with him, and as she says, "she lives like wooden ducks with their young." That is simply incorrect. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: this is the weirdest and most insane show I've seen. For those who like to make fun of silly things, they will love it. For anyone else, skip this show.
