Hercules: The TV- Movie Hercules - A very twisted and changed version of the story about the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero. Sean Astin emphasizes his image of Sam Gamgee to play Lupine, a character thrown to make everything become a movie of friends. I almost expected him to say at some point, "We're in a bad situation, Mr. Frodo, uh, I mean Hercules." A good and unexpected performance comes from Timothy Dalton (one of the smaller James Bonds) as the father of Hercules. The loving look of Herucles Like Paris Hilton, something that turned me off immediately, no doubt, someone has twisted and transformed the original story into a turbulent and sometimes incomprehensible story, special effects do not help either. justice to the original story, the Nemean Lion and the Harpies are ... well lame, I think the creatures and the effects of the Power Rangers went through my mind at least twice and the Golden Hind felt rushed and very computer generated and eliminated Cerberus from my favorite parts of what was originally a great story.The film can not decide whether it is Greek, Roman or American, and almost ruined the original story, an epic Classic Do not bother looking for this in the direct to DVD. - C
