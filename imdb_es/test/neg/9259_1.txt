Take a bad script, a bit of bad acting and throw a politically incorrect morality story and, what do you get? Something that is supposed to happen for a quality family visit. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone is the story of a nineteenth-century family traveling across the United States in a train car, waiting for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three children, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not sure) hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the family that lives a seemingly normal 19th century. The life of the century on a farm in the middle of nowhere. The eldest son John is a precocious adolescent, 'lazy and good for nothing', as his father constantly reminds him. We see from the beginning that he has a fondness for practical jokes when he ties the rope to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects him to a nearby mule. When the mule moves, of course, the poor ones get out of bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a leash. <br /> <br /> A train of wagons passes that same day. Pa is tempted to join as he promises a new life in the wild and wild west. So the family hooks their belongings and leaves. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film seems weak and amateurish. The acting is below grade, as in one of those films shown at the school about the pioneers. However, I can not blame the actors because the lines in this film are silly and too sickly and optimistic. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I captured this movie while changing the channels on a boring Saturday afternoon. in a Christian television station. I, who did not have a religious mentality, watched in horror as Seven Alone offered moral statements that were not only outdated, but were simply offensive! If I were a good Christian, I would have expected to have the good sense to complain to the television station about transmitting so much garbage. However, because I am a cynic, not a believer with an evil sense of humor, I chose to sit down and laugh like a fool. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of ​​going to Oregon to his wife. His response is a heated "About my corpse." We're supposed to laugh, I suppose, when the film moves to the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as she drives the wagon across the prairies. Oh, I suppose even the most unwavering feminist would have to admit that this "Father knows better" attitude was the norm in those days, and one could argue the need for such a dictatorial government when living conditions were difficult, but somehow I understood the problem. feeling that this movie supported that notion, even for today. Enchanting message from a Christian television station. <br /> <br /> Anyway, things get worse for the family and the moral integrity of the movies decreases even more. An Indian (or Native American) steals John while lying in a field sleeping. Like a common savage, the Indian takes clothes and belongings from John. Fortunately, Pa, with the help of passer-by Kit Carson, can kill the Indian, as well as a couple of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by the resident doctor of the train car, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, stating that he is a useless brat. Maybe it's like that, but also the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon, who seems unable to tie his shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the girl did not cry when the car ran and broke her leg in two, because Dr. Dutch did not seem to have the proper manners. We know the drawbacks of constantly belittling a child. Here is a movie that promotes that behavior. <br /> <br /> Later, Pa develops food poisoning, or something like that, he was not paying much attention and he dies. His scene on the deathbed is the subject of which the great performance is made. Frankly, the man did not even look sick. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Mom also dies. The children are left to fend for themselves. And that's when the real adventure begins. Hitting through the rapids, finding more Indians (although these are nice) and venturing through snowy terrain, these kids do it all. And I kept thinking: "What a lot of garbage!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there was nothing good in this movie. This small low-budget house on the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and at a time when the treatment of Native Americans was focused, something like this could be done. <br /> <br />
