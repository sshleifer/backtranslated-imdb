'Carolina Moon' is a suitable film made for television about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was murdered. It turns out that every year, on the same date, another girl <br /> <br /> is killed and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female protagonist and does a good job, with the support of Oliver Hudsom and a Jacqueline Bisset that is still bright. The script, adapted from a novel by Nora Roberts, is standard and the argument <br /> <br /> is tediously predictable. That, however, is compensated again by, as I said, the rather delicious Oliver Hudson.
