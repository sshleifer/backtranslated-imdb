Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the repugnant propaganda that Moore tries to call "humor". That this film, and Moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers, proves that, unfortunately, it is possible to cheat some people all the time. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can attract foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hate in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can leave the isolationist Charles Lindbergh. The only thing that Moore lacks compared to Lindbergh is a GÃ¶ring medal. <br /> <br /> It's true that in this movie, Moore had a bit of self-deprecation for his behavior. In this film, Moore mocks Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, as a distant and carefree elitist. Moore could do that in 1989, but now that Moore has surrendered to a distant and indifferent elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic twinge. Who really would not rather be Roger's friend than Michael Moore's?
