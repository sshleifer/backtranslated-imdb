Probably one of the worst movies I've done, I'm still trying to figure out if it was to be fun, but I'm sure I did not have fun at all. Maybe the movie lost something during the English-Italian translation, dunno, I'm sure I miss the guts to see it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My rate for that is 2/10, and I feel like it is. I'm being very generous (let's say that 1 point is for Liv because she is a good babe, and the other point is for those decent actors who got caught up in a worthless, useless and pathetic movie) <br /> <br /> Be careful <br /> <br /> Alex
