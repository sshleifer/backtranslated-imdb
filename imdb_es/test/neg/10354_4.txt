Since I am from Australia and I loved the series, I did not expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I would watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what is there to say? It's nothing special .Selma Blair is fine as Kim and she actually had some good lines, although Molly Shannon is not a good Kath. The nice thing about Kath, Jane Turner, is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like it's the natural way she talks, but when Shannon tries the accent, it's clear that she's acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the program really misses Sharon or someone else to give us something to laugh about, because the characters of Kal and Craig in this version are not really fun. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has been aired and it is clear that it is not up to the standards of the Australian version, even if it were an independent television program with a different name, when not compared to the Australian version, it may be considered a little better. But if there's nothing else to do on Sunday night (or Thursday night in the United States), it can not hurt much to see it, or better put something from the Australian version if you have it.
