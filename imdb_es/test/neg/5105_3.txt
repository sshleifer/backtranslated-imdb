I was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie is, so I guess I should not complain. Twentysomething Tom (gay poster boy Robert Stadlober) has so many problems that he does not know if he is going or not. I would not have stayed for the beautiful girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); meaningless Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as the star of the movie inside the movie. And then there's Tom's soul mate, Margarete with wild eyes (Jana Pallaske). It reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I mean ridiculous, even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was the age of the characters. My guess is that I would not. Beware of Indian idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder of "Der Hund Marie" acting as street musicians, without feeling pain.
