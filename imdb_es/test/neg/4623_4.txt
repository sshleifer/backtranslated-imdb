Woohoo! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> That's the deepest thought I got after seeing George And The Dragon, something disappointing. For a fantasy comedy, the story was very boring and the effects were not spectacular. <br /> <br /> The problem was not acting. James Purefoy is a good gentleman, and his various side kicks are not bad characters. I even thought that Patrick Swayze in this role was also a good idea. Piper Perabo flat-chested also had good potential. I even liked the boy. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens, and the way it happens, was just "eh". It is not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually fun, this movie is terribly short. I'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn-inducing truculence. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
