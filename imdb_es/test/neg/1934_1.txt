Probably something cultural, somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this fun. I experienced this phenomenon first-hand, during an outdoor movie event, where this movie was shown before the film. The majority of the indigenous audience laughed, and no, this was not in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, but in a well-off area, and the audience consisted mainly of educated adults. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it must be possible, somehow, to find this fun, but honest, I have no idea what it takes, maybe it's in the air or in the water, the long exposure which causes this condition. Something must cause it, obviously, the only thing I can say is that I am quite sure of what does not cause it: the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes in it. It is a dead brain, stupid, meaningless, without grace, lame. It is, ultimately, a waste of time. Any Tom and Jerry is more fun, but even funerals are more fun. <br /> <br /> In case you have been lucky not to have seen any of the performances of the Stooges: there are three types that behave, run, even speak. like retarded babies, who cause all kinds of chaos without grace, without plot, without real purpose and without real conclusion. It's like the ugly Teletubbies without the cute costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a crowd watching this crap in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you're at a party with a bunch of braggarts and you're the only one who has not smoked at all. <br /> <br /> Then, unless you're ready to get intoxicated to make this bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think that seeing three old, ugly men behave like idiots is Funny, my advice on this is: stay. Far away.
