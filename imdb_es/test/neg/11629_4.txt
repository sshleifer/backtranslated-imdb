Let's clarify things. I was raised as a Catholic and in a very religious family, and spent so much time in the church and talking with the priests at home. That was useful for two things: making me a convinced atheist and giving me a deep and profound knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and sees clearly the killer's face, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed later. He can not reveal what he said in the confession, but he CAN talk about anything he sees outside of that, and the confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So, here we have a movie completely based on a lie. And another lie is that there is no acquittal for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolution for any sin, as long as there is sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller. <br /> <br /> As people often say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Hoskins is naturally suited to play the gangsters (I will never regret enough that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weakest performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's characteristics would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. But on top of that, I think the movie would have been much better if Liam Neeson, a Ulster native in real life (then unknown to big audiences) would have played the role of Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face perfect for playing tormented characters, but he makes us believe that the character is real, something that Rourke simply can not. In the 80s, Rourke was not a bad actor (he later seemed to lose his talent along with his appearance), but he was one of those artists, like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's performance is more like a pimp. It is sad to think that, if this film had been made only three to six years later (when Neeson reached moderate celebrity status in 1990 with the pleasant "Darkman" of Sam Raimi, and the superstar in 1993 with the "List of Schindler, "Rourke became a large part of a forgotten state, Liam and Mickey could have switched the parts to a greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in Docherty's supporting role, but can not take this film as a protagonist). Another missed opportunity, and another film with the potential to be a classic, which became an easily forgettable rate. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the score often criticized (by the underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me I did not find it too melodramatic, but rather gritty and beautiful, it reminded me of Howard Shore's score for "The Silence of the Lambs." Here's the talent of Mike Hodges, who created "Get Carter," yes, but do not forget that it is also the brain behind "Flash Gordon" ... <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie was massacred in the courtroom (it is seen, since some parts are really choppy and confusing, and others simply do not stick) and a Director's Court is waiting to see the light. It's fine, but I seriously doubt it's a great movie, since we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.
