Hubie, like Stanely, the troll of Bluth's A Troll in Central Park, lacks the spark of personality to be the main character in a whole movie. We're supposed to like it because it's nice, but that's all it is. <br /> <br /> Your character design is not attractive. The top of its head is a kind of dome that is narrower than the plump bottom of the head. <br /> <br /> And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago, Aladdin's parrot, had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his sweet little voice (provided by Martin Short), looks funny with that great set of chompers at his peak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is generally charming for being mean, makes a silly surfer accent like the villain (could have been a good voice for an accomplice of comic relief, not the supposedly threatening main villain) . <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the villain's hero and love for the female Marine Penguin. who is as bored as his two suitors. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all is the rhythm. We continue to resort to the villain to see him threaten Marina a little more, this time in dialogue, this time in the song ... <br /> <br /> Barry Manilow can be a great composer, but in animated films like this and Thumbelina, her songs feel loose and apathetic, especially the ballads. The only song that I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the wishes of the filmmaker, and that could have caused some of the problems. - although I suspect that the real problem is that they did not cut the rest;).
