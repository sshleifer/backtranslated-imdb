To paraphrase the comments of the previous critic, if you are a fan of Stooges, avoid this at all costs! My basic question is that, being the experienced comedy soldiers that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on trying to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was not so interested in giving them serious writers? veteran comedy directors? This movie is interpreted as someone who is imitating the trio in a pale way and you can see how hard Moe and Larry are working to make every bit of slapstick relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his vaudeville experience, is not up to the job as a replacement for Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If that's the place that Moe and Larry had left to choose from, they should have closed the store and enjoyed their retirement years. Leaving the fans with better memories of much better movies they had done before. Let them always laugh is the slogan of comedy and always give up when you're up. Therefore, Seinfeld is leaving the comedy while it is there, instead of staying for the inevitable decline.
