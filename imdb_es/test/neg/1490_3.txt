I found an old VHS version of this movie in my parents' house, so I thought about trying it out. From the beginning I did not expect much from this film and I'm glad of that because in general the film was not good. <br /> <br /> The acting in general was very bad, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. A scene with a radio controller stands out for being so pitiful that I found it hilarious that this scene had not been cut. The first 30 minutes of the film almost did not have a developed plot and I did not know what was happening. <br /> <br /> The story itself had the possibility of being decent, but the director was simply bad or was trying. Too hard to put his unique touch on the style of the movie. I managed to see everything, but I will probably never see this movie again.
