I saw this movie yesterday on television. He had just read the book in which the movie was supposedly based. In the initial credits he said "This is a free adaptation of the novel by Eça de Queirós". I should have turned off my television at that time. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is turning a story about the influence of the Church on people and the hypocrisy of people who claim morality at the end of the 19th century. in a story about sex. In fact, the only thing he adopted from the novel was the sexual part, which is only mentioned slightly in the novel by Eça de Queirós. And, of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> From the characters, in the novel, Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of the influence of the church. Amelia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. João Eduardo, his fiancé, was excommunicated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. In this film, Amélia seduces everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a drug dealer and illegal gunner. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento has turned a novel that criticized the moral costumes of an era and turned it into another film with many (bad) sexual relationships. Worse, his story was completely empty of ideas. Two hours wasted! Eça de Queirós surely did not deserve this.
