Is there a clich√© of firefighters that is NOT used in this movie? From the initial line "I'm getting too old for this" through the "pranks" of the firemen, to the "worrying wife" the loss of his best friend at the fire station, to the final funeral for the fallen brothers, this movie seems and it seems that it was written by the marketing department of Disney ("Our studies show that the audience really likes it when ..." and then they included it). <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. Any emotion that we feel for these boys is due to our admiration and feelings for the firemen. <br /> <br /> Go to Rescue Me if you want to see real heroes: every day, with defects that do not think of encountering a burning building to save strangers.
