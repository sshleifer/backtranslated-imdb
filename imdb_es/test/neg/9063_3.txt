As a serious marathon runner, I was very disappointed in this movie. Your target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathons. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a beginner woman whose story is, for want of a better word. , boring. While I enjoyed the brief glimpses of Deena Kastor's training sessions, the brief history of the Boston Marathon and the marathon in general, let me emphasize: These were brief! Seeing some Joe Runners preparing for a Saturday race with their water bottles and talking about how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the continuous clich√©s about achievements and the smiling runners to feel good will make you want the movie to be about shorter time If you are a marathon runner for the first time, this movie can give you the feeling that "I can do it". For any other person, run away.
