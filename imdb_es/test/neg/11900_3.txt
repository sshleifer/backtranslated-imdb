Before I rented this kind of "soft core", but I can honestly say that I did not expect it to be the same guy as "Rod Steele: you only live until you die", which was both sexy and fun. He had a good script, a sincere leader and a sense of purpose. She also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason I did not expect this movie was because the sticker was missing "You must be 18 years old to rent". I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". <br /> <br /> First of all, I think you should not allow films to start with "actors" rehearsing for a role in a talent agency (or where the "actors" rehearse). In this film, watching the "actors" rehearse highlights the lack of preparation to play the true characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Well, upon discovering that this was a soft core movie, I did not. I do not necessarily turn it off and demand that I get my money back. But, vertiginously, the "erotic" scenes of extended video are added to what was probably a very annoying and easy-to-move nighttime cable release without the sustained quality of, say, Rod Steele. You know they must have had some money, because I think part of the video is filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> I'll have to say that the main actor trying NOT to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most disconcerting acting jobs I've ever seen. And, I've seen Torgo de Manos! It may really have been worth the dollar rent (that and Gabriella Hall). Still, there are better cheesy movies to rent with your friends.
