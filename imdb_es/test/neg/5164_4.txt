I saw this movie today on the big screen and I honestly can not believe some of the comments made by people here. I really expected to be moved by this movie, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I am a former Australian Army and very patriotic towards this great country, but I think this film does not do justice for us and those soldiers who fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The movie is badly filmed. I thought the acting was terrible, they were not credible and they did not give me any reason to worry about them. People say that this movie was graphic, there were a couple of graphic scenes, but most of them seemed very weak. The scenes of war were very short and lasted only a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, a weak film that does not do justice to these soldiers.
