I had never heard of this movie before I got it on TV last night. I hope it has never been released to the cinema, as this would be an insult to both the big screen and the moviegoers. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be fun? Why the outrageously basic plot? Does anyone really care? ... <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
