I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival had to include this film in their program. I guess you should agree with the others who have reviewed this movie. I, on the other hand, consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with an incorrect script, full of holes and a dialogue so unlikely that it is embarrassing. Ideas are introduced, then abandoned without development. The performance left me totally cold and not involved. The decoration of the stage was appropriate for the moment, but the nightmare of a decorator. The only way that the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been dreadful. The attic looked as if the items had been thrown onto the scene without trying to create the look of a real penthouse that has been filling with garbage for years. The photograph was leaden and lacked variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.
