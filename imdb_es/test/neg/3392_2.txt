This DVD lasts just 30 minutes and has boring interviews that reveal that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of around 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of them. From the less talented metal bands that have sold more than 100,000 units of their garbage. (The only reason I say "one of the" instead of "the" is that System Of A Down is even worse.) Like the brides of Ed Gein, the music of this band is made up of metal clich√©s very old, they must be They are both in their image and in their ultra-boring music. In fact, his image is quite funny; their videos are like fragments of corny horror movies, so they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> His music, however, has nothing of quality, not at all: just a handful of gadgets. A few million times previously played exclusively on the neck of the guitar that are not related to each other and, however, are grouped randomly to form "songs" that have no cohesion, or highlights, or anything. But if the riffs are really bad, then the voices are even worse: the singer of Slipknot has a stereotyped grunt and, therefore, uninteresting, "evil" (90% of all metal bands of today), but that's nothing compared to when you start trying. to sing! However, what can you expect? Rule no.39 of the "Nu Metal" manual clearly states: "You will alternate and sing, you ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well, because most of your fans are so deaf they will love you" even if you get in the microphone. "Slipknot is at its worst when its" singer "begins to spit" melodies ". <br /> <br /> But it returns to its image, it is stolen, copied, cheated, cut, borrowed, taken without asking nothing more than Mr.Bungle, have you never heard of them? Of course not, you only listen to nu-metal, and Mr.Bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. (grotesque, horror, similar to those of Slipknot, I might add) in the late 80's and early 90's. This band, whose leader is Mike Patton of Faith No More, never made it to success because his music was not aimed at the average music fans (to put it mildly). <br /> <br /> Then, basically e, Slipknot is not, not even original in the image department. They have nothing new to offer, so they will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring for the legions of their zit-faced fans, is when Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market only with its generic music. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Mike Patton, it is interesting that several nu-metal bands often consider their singing as a great influence. As expected, and fortunately, Patton is not flattered by this and has denied being proud of having been an influence on one of the worst metal subgenres of all time ... <br /> <br /> Having said that, enjoy this short DVD and the cheap emotions that could provide the untrained ear and the boring eye ... And then polish those Slipknot posters, because in a few years nobody will take care of them, the poor ones. <br /> <br /> After seeing Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed", I finally understand why he wears a mask: it's a blue-eyed baby ginger, who looks like Dave's younger brother Mustaine! It is not exactly scary. <br /> <br /> For more information about my speeches in the world of music, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me STRONG, VERY DIFFICULT, by clicking "no" below.
