All this seemed quite promising. A promising presidential adviser is framed by a series of murders, as he has been told that a conspiracy is going on inside the White House. It stars the excellent Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. However, very few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needed some depth. You can understand the idea that the president is being too leftist with his ideas, and some within the government want him to die to prevent those ideas from being carried out. Conrad seems to simply want the country to be governed in its own way, rather than the path of the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, the action scenes had some logical holes: the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather random killing method - and the character of Linda Hamilton is completely uninspired. His "deviation" from "the president is my father" was ridiculous: that would make the president have 10 when that happened. Worst yet was his predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have done a defiant and inventive political thriller, but they bottled it or failed. They could have gone to the city for special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved much more in general. This was barely worth the Â£ 1 that cost me.
