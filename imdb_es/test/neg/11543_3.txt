Located in the Philippines, Lethal Panther 2 is a martial arts action movie from the early 1990s that sees a reckless policeman pursue the criminals who killed his wife. A production of rather economic aspect, with almost no artistic merit, this film is based on the quality and quantity of its action. But while there is no shortage of punches, gun fights and explosions, quality simply does not exist. The endless battles desperately lack originality or emotion, with bad editing and a worldly direction, which makes this film a real task to sit down. <br /> <br /> The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally lost, with his natural athletic ability surpassed. for some unbearably bad wire work. Ballistic action scenes are an impressive mix of "slow-motion heroism flying through the air as it shoots", crazy vehicle tricks and a host of bad guys who line up to be shot. <br /> <br /> With so many better examples of the 'girls and weapons' genre now available on DVD, I suggest you leave this well alone (unless, like me, you support almost any old garbage to be a completista) .
