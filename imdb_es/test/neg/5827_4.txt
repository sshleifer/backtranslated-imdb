I saw Winnie Heffalump a couple of days ago. A beautiful story based on well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are present in this animated feature, the main character is Roo this time. He befriends Heffalump, who shows that he is not scary at all and shows everyone that friendship has no limits and that everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I would love it even more if I was 10 or 15 years younger. Oh, I would like to be a child again to enjoy this story of Heffalump much more, but all I have left is a sad feeling for the loss of a kind of childish innocence that this movie is full of? I was glad to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely provided a great score.
