When I first saw the progress of this movie on television, I thought it could be a fun movie. I was wrong. Although I'm not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are really funny, like the first horror movie. This was one of the many that have been made lately that are not. The humor in this movie was anything but funny and quite boring. <br /> <br /> I think one of the biggest problems is that they made fun of many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc. And if you're like me, you try to choose each movie instead of paying attention to what happens in it. Even the adult humor in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money, time and rent. Do not rent this movie.
