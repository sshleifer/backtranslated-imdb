The alleged "queen of the scream" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes travel west to the location of the title and encounter grisly murders that turn out to be the work of a cult of former confederate psychopaths trying to resurrect the south through a senseless massacre. <Br /> <br /> The action and the suspense take a back seat before a lot of boring dialogues and the development of uninteresting characters. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful role of the morphist in the city, but everything else about this aspiring Slasher Western is extremely poor, including the city and the fort, which look like tourist traps of Modern western style and costumes that seem to have been bought in Party City. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor and look at Ravenous instead.
