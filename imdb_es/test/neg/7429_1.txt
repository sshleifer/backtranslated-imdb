This will be my first revision in IMDb and I am happy that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then I do not have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> First, there are horrible movies. Movies that you can laugh at, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. That is totally acceptable. They make a great party enhancer. Then there are the worst movies in history. I can not believe how utterly horrible this pile of peat dogs was. <br /> <br /> I found it in a thrift store on VHS and I bought it quickly because I like science fiction, Terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff. how that. Everything in the art picture was very promising. Then I loaded the tape quickly when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There were maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between current clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you puke. And it simply continues again and again. Then, some "acting" comes into play and you wonder why you were born in a world, where this abomination of humanity really exists ... And then I realized that, in reality, THERE ARE TWO PRECEDENTS. I did not think it first, but the title says "3" in it ... And I was horrified. But as in reality, with great pain and agony, I see it until the end, I thought that nothing could make me feel worse about myself and this universe ... But then a little text appeared that said ... "Next .. . "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO, PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
