MGM tried to mate and approach the young people with the Divine to expose them and prove them as main men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX but it was a terrible movie. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the script is also deficient. What were you thinking? The modern Montgomery, the one that speaks fast, the one that breaks the snap and the long-standing Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. The young student falls in love with the woman of the world and is rejected when she finds out about her past, rejects it, withdraws it, rejects it ... you get an idea. Garbo is completely credible as a model of a Parisian artist superior and completely at home, although bored, with his life at the top of society in the midst of his artistic friends and his lost morality. Suddenly, she is fascinated by this innocent. Finally, she abandons her life for him and immerses herself in poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. Ironically, he intends to marry her and keep her aside, both because of her pure moral ethos of the past. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly boring and boring and nothing happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu can inject life into the procedures with lines like "Unfortunately, weak women have a big appetite" and "Odette, where's your sting?" <br /> <br /> Only for Garbo fans.
