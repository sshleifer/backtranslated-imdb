This was an absolute disgrace! The worst dramatization I've ever seen. The German officers with an impeccable English accent, did not even try to be Germans. How were we supposed to take them seriously? Garbage garbage junk Leave the German performance to the likes of Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson in the future.
