Despite his high-level ambitions, Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. One thing is to create a world that attracts the viewer to feel the boredom and anguish experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was trying). Another thing is to make a movie that is tedious and without episodic sense. Despite the beautiful cinematography in a disturbing place, and a wonderful score, the film never attracts the audience. Too much is involuntarily funny (the false sound of dripping water in the neighborhoods of Drago, for example, or the muffling of some actors' silent movies) or simply confusing (why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort the first time?) that the film succeeds as a coherent work.
