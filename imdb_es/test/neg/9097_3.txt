This movie has some pretty gorey parts like a tit that is bitten and other big bites. The same Castle Freak is a good monster. It would scare me to pieces if he came for me. However, the movie had some silly parts about it. <br /> <br /> A husband gets drunk and runs away and kills his 3-year-old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater harm than blindness, but you would never know that parents really feel bad because their daughter is blind. All they care about is that "J.J.'s dead!" While your teenage daughter walks and runs into things and talks about how she can never drive a car. Parents say, "Honey, stop walking without a guide, you know better than that," and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. It sounds like a favor to me. <br /> <br /> The lines of dialogue are not very realistic and well done. For example, when you hear a giant crash in the castle, everyone runs to the basement to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. The husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and says clearly: "The mirror broke." I do not know, I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed in my castle. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife have some important relationship problems and it is funny to see how they are foolish with each other. Nobody ever believes the blind girl. Tip: If a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and do not tell her to shut up. I think this is the moral of the story. Listen to people when they say things to you or you could end up killing yourself to prove your point of view. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought that the best character was the chief police officer. He was the best actor and character. Everyone else (besides Castle Freak) was quite ahead. 3/10
