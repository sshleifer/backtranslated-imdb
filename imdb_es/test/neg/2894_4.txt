This is a very boring movie with less developed characters, subparcelas that do not go anywhere and a hardly tolerable performance. It is presented as a poorly conceived scam of "2001". <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes it worthwhile are the sets, the costumes and the visual effects. But even that was not enough to keep me from falling asleep. I would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the sequence of space flight, for the nights when I find it hard to get to sleep.
