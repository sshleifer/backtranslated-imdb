Take some dark and stormy nights, fog that comes from the coast, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night that silently grinds a burning butt and, finally, a tremulous heroine who is threatened both by her own doubts and by one, but which one? - About the men who surround her. It sounds like we can have a good 80 minutes. Instead, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and two leaders of the A list, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes a matinee matinee of almost two hours, a long tide of threatening anguish amidst the perfectly arranged cast, combed and dress. When you take a look at your watch in the middle of the movie and with a sinking heart you see that you have another hour left, it is likely that both you and the film have problems. <br /> <br /> Minnelli, in one of his first non-musical films, does not rely on the Rococo greenhouse approach as much as he later learned. Still, what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession becomes an endless vehicle for Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in carefully illuminated close-ups how to show fear, love, anxiety, vertigo, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less along the ride. <br /> <br /> Hepburn begins the film as the disheveled Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman with pants who helps her father with his inventions. Your housekeeper is determined to marry her. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it is love at first sight. Garroway is the dynamic and elegant inventor of the Garroway distance controller, which was vital in the war and has turned him into a millionaire manufacturer that charges hard. He is a captain of the industry, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, can still be a bit of a tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those congressmen and judges her husband knows. She learns quickly and with enthusiasm. Both are obviously and happily in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The canker is about to gnaw. Ann realizes that she does not know anything about her husband's family. None of your employees or friends seems inclined to tell you about her. When he learns little by little that Alan's mother died in the old family house in Middleburg while sitting at the piano, or that he has a brother, Michael, who disappeared, Alan is very quiet ... and sometimes he gets furious. He always apologizes. But wait one more time. Did your mother really play the piano? Did not she really die in bed? Michael was not surprised taking money from the family business and Alan fired him? All this plays against the exquisite suites of the hotel, the well-kept country house in Middleburg with the horse stable and the elegant country house by the sea. Everyone in the movie, except employees, is dressed to the nines. There are exclusive cocktails and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black and white film, Minnelli can not stop giving us dining tables full of glass and china, elegant and tasteful furniture and many dresses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when everything is finally known, when Ann on horseback is chased along a high mountain trail and extremely well designed by the bad boy on another horse, when the They threaten Death by the rock and its persecutor finally meet death on horseback, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to put a lot of tension into the film. What could have been in the hands of a minor B-movie, however, with the A list is just an exaggerated melodrama, too big for his bones.
