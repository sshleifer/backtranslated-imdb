What can be said about THIS? Truly one of the most numbing experiences of my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of a primordial drive for self-preservation. I was devastated by the experience of seeing this "movie" and it took me two hours to recover completely. This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror movies. I certainly do not refer to this distinction in a good way. I refer to this in a terrible way. A terrible way <br /> <br /> This movie does not have redemption features. Everything is frightening. Camera work without art presents us infinitely the ugliest scenario imaginable, that is, a lot of corn, a lot of clay. The story is beyond stupidity. Is the script? Was there a script? The villain is severely imperturbable and wears yellow sleeve boots. The children are annoying. The protagonist is free of charisma. And he has the audacity to continue for 100 minutes. Absolutely without merit on any level, this is similar to torture. Normally, such an affirmation would be an exaggeration intended for the comic effect. Not in this case. I'll even say it again ?? this is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. This was fortunately brief. But once I recovered, I decided I had to see the 'Making Of' featurette. Had to understand Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. Was it all an elaborate joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of the 'Making Of' series and found out that the writer / director was, to say the least, somewhat wrong. I also discovered that because I had taken the time to see the first two minutes of the 'Making Of' series of Dark Harvest 2, I was an idiot. It is not a pleasant journey of self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Highly not recommended.
