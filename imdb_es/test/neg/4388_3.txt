Look at the positive comments of this movie for users, then check how often each user comments. They publish once. It seems that companies are probably paying for services that publish comments of unwanted advertising films in IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. The plot was stupid. The performance was poor. The jokes were not even fun. The movie included minor nudes of what looked like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie was not fun. There were some slaps here and there, but it was assumed that most of the humor was derived from the characters who spoke behind the backs of others and spread rumors. This is not even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The film is worthy of a fast breakthrough or, better yet, not watch it. <br /> <br /> I regret seeing this movie and if I could charge the Studio and distributor for 1.5 hours I was robbed I would.
