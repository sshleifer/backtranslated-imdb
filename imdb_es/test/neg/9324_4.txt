I found Dominion a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story. The original movie was a story about evil, and how it can infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> The Schrader version is not bad. Spectators do not have an overwhelming sense of fear, fear or even premonition. Harlin's version offers an obvious flaw, shows violations of the sanctity of the church and builds a compelling story that is plausible, given Father Merrin's background. The story of Schrader leaves one wondering what exactly happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the audience to empathize with Father Merrin, and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was worried in the first place. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in seeing a sequel that matches the original should see the exorcist: The beginning.
