This movie was very bad. I mean really really bad. The scenes were like a parody and the special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003! I think this was a big waste of time and money, and Michael Shanks with his 'Shaggy from Scooby Doo' image made me laugh. Never waste time with this picture ... I really do not know what the director thought after seeing the final cut of this movie, but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look at them. The wrestlers of the "cat latex women" were like sheep that simply rolled around the scenes and seemed scared as if they had no idea what to do in the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of the Bottom 100 image .
