The most famous of this film is that this was the first time that Garbo spoke in a movie. Apart from that 'milestone' (if you want to call it that), this is a film that does not go beyond the melodrama crunch, with Garbo doing his best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Greta Garbo returns to his father after 15 years abroad. His father, who is a captain on a barge, is happy to see her, even though he is acting a little cautious. She soon falls in love with a grizzled sailor, who also realizes that something, a barrier if you want, is holding her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two guys do not especially like each other and soon they come. blows on Garbo, when she spreads the situation revealing her Big Secret that does not surprise us, if you have read the video box (damn, MGM!) Garbo is nothing but arms in this film, act and act. Waving his arms around, and quickly grating. The two male drivers are fine. Probably the best performance comes from the classic and silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays drunken drunken captain drunk. What an action! It is a pity that the slogan could not read: "Dressler speaks!"
