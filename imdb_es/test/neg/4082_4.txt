The creative team behind Evan Almighty really should have been able to make a better movie. Starring one of the favorite fans of the United States and directed by Tom Shadyac, director of Ace Ventura Pet Detective, one expects a greater amount of laughter than the image offers. Hell, even Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed the atrocious Barnyard last year, and gets a writing credit here, has done a better job. The fact is that Evan Almighty is not the worst image of the summer season, but it could be the most disappointing. The title and the creative team behind the image suggest that this is a sequel to Bruce Almighty from 2003. That image had Jim Carrey in the lead, and although both Steve Carell and Carrey are two funny guys, the latter is the one that best It adapts to this type of material. I heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor refused to say that he did not see other places where his character could venture. In this way, Shadyac moved to Carell, who, since then, from a funny part in the original version of 2003 has been trying to achieve stardom. After the sleeper hits The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine, the man has become a big business, so it is he, and not Jim, who confronts this production to the theaters. The story goes that Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) was elected as a member of Congress and, therefore, he and his troop move home and to the state so that Evan can find success in his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and their three children have doubts, but in general they show a side of support towards Evan, who looks to the future with optimistic eyes. However, things start to fall apart pretty quickly, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan saying that a flood is coming and that the politician must build an Ark. Initially, ignoring the encounter, Evan is quickly given some tunics and a beard that refuses to shave. And the animals begin to appear in pairs. Evan begins to put the boat under construction, but the neighborhood is not happy and none of them is a politician (John Goodman). Anyone who expects the crazy laughs from some of Tom Shadyac's other films will probably be completely cold with this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and hell, including Almighty Bruce, were mostly very funny pictures, but all those projects have one thing in common and that is the presence of Jim Carrey. Shadyac has not made a worthwhile movie without Carrey being in charge, he has worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now with Steve Carell, but even so only Carrey seems to merge successfully with Shadyac. Carell, after the disappointing box office and critics, will not be desperate to return to work with the director, and with Carrey now doing more serious projects, Shadyac should quickly find a new comic muse. Carell himself is pretty boring here, who felt that his small part in the first film (despite being quite funny) deserved a full-length feature, should retire and shoot. I guess after Bruce Almighty's Box-Office draw they went to Universal Studios, but you know that when a quality comedian can not do anything with a character, Scren's character is a failure, and that's exactly the case with Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham is not as good as Evan's wife nor does any of the children play the right note. Freeman leaves everything loose as God in another funny and spooky performance, but it seems that sporadically takes the piece. In fact, the source of more consistent laughter is the Secretary of Evan (Wanda Sykes) and his co-worker (Jonah Hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedekerk's writing has been worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work in this production. His script has genuinely funny moments, but it's also full of cloying family moments and humor is never strange or offensive enough. The film becomes docile and easy to religion when it should break the concept into strips, in fact, the church's opening sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion more than Evan Almighty's 95-minute career. With a little more audacity and heart, this could have been a much better image. I do not doubt that the audience of the central family entertains a little with this film, but if they are satisfied it is a completely different question. There is a line between being observable and worthwhile, a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side. Maybe when you feel bored and the cable movies you can watch them, but I can think of much better ways to spend my time and, more importantly, on my money than to tune into this mediocre comedy.
