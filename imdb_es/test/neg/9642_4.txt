Actuated in excess, with a heavy hand, full of speeches, preaching, in the nose and more stylized in a way that only MTV could be guilty, Stop-Loss is a litter of agitation. I expected much more with talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but screenwriter / director Kimberly Peirce does a great job of portraying the negative effects of the war on American youth. I'm sure she did a job investigating the war in Iraq and the young people who fight in it, but you would never guess seeing Stop the loss. In many ways, this disaster reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, a waste of solid matter similar to an equally inept and overly stylized television movie. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
