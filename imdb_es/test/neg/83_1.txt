Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty sure my team could do it in less than a week. This movie was so bad that I could not even pay much attention to it. Just one more proof that women with boobs can not always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Now I understand that it was an effort without a budget, but there is no continuity or real reason not to turn it off and see infomercials or foreign news in a language that does not understand. Oh, there are some decent looking females that show the products. However, there are not enough attractive women alive to justify the observation of this farce perpetrated in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. However, I solved it with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon because you will want to use it after this hacking work. Finally, the individual (imbecile) who left a comment before mine, thought it was a great movie and LOVED it. Just one more proof that brothers should not create. Oh, BURN! - Captain J
