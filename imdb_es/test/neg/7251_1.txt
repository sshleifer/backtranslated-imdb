Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. This was a movie that I tried and hated. Worst of all is that, after hearing so many people denounce the superficiality of typical Hollywood food and its stereotyped cartoons, I saw characters too outrageous for "Eastenders" to be seen as realistic. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to get out of the life of drugs And for that he aspires to be a waiter. Aim high, I always say it. Brad Dorif, or a photo of him sent by fax, or possibly a curly wig with a stick, it was hard to say, offers to hire Clint if he receives a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wandering all over England trying to get him some shoes. Eventually, they end up in a suburban house. Whose is not clear. Mom helps a girl shoot. Oh, now there's some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but it never helped Marsha to tie up and find a vein. Good god! Dad comes home, sings some Elvis songs and then scares the kids away. <br /> <br /> Why did not Clint borrow money and buy shoes at a thrift store? Why did not he go to a church and ask a kind nun for help? Why did not he pass a shoe store and a beggar? I just do not know! None of these things seemed to be beneath him. Benevolent groups such as Goodwill and Salvation Army have stores to help people. I know people who work there! If someone without money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give him some shoes. Maybe it's not Prada or Gucci, but some form of covering the feet. Not many of these groups distribute cell phones to disadvantaged people, but shoes are not usually a problem. What a silly concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, is just not so cruel. In England, maybe it's "The Queen's Royal Charity" instead of Goodwill, but people who need shoes do. <br /> <br /> Apart from the search for shoes, there was no perceptible plot to hinder. Of action. Not that it made the movie faster or more bearable, of course. Despite having reviewed the cassette tape several times, I was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it just seemed that way. <br /> <br /> Clint received his shoes? Did the cardboard cut of Brad Dourif hire him in the restaurant? Did I ever see anything more foreign? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fate of this particular movie, I decided to finish it. everyone. I pulled out my S & W .45 and threw a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store and, surprisingly, NEVER CALLED TO ASK IT! Which means, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something that I did not. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has put a bullet, take it as a signal. And if you work in Kroger's video department, I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> Note: this classic has not yet seen the light of day on DVD, so we should be eternally grateful to the digital gods.
