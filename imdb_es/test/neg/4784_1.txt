I saw the first 10 minutes of this program, I think I'm going to throw up now! One of the worst television programs. It's not even funny. He is so lame that he is disgusting. I gave him a second and third change, I could not even exceed five minutes. Do not waste your time. This is one of the many programs that should go, bye. Speaking of regular night shows that need to leave. All shows on CBS. All the shows on ABC. All shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All the shows in the new CW network. All the shows on NBC. (Accept the Law and Order series). All talk shows in the morning and afternoon. All the television programs of the court. And every reality show out there! Every stupid game show. Period the end! All the home improvement shows! And all the news from the media. all that is. It's a 24 hour loop of bad news. Yes, I have favorites Monk, The law & Orders that's for me.
