One of the commentators is wrong. This is not Pat Patterson's only film and he did not die two years after it was made. He shot a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know because he used my house and left a cat there! He sucked too. This was a big problem when the movie came out. No independent horror films were made in North Carolina. This movie did not help things. Patterson used to do gore effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His bloody scenes in Body Shop were really well done. The film was filmed in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can see the upper parts of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. Only Patterson could understand it. Still ... it's entertainment and it's a classic.
