I'm surprised that so many people find this movie even close to good. Let me clarify that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and that I did everything possible to have as many video films as I could, but I felt that it was way below, not only for Hitch's films, wow! I'm being too nice here. This photo really sucked. I do not care that Hitch did a favor to the talented Carole Lombard, but I've seen comedies of the 50 with more intelligence and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Listne I like mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I would not like to try them together. I have seen better chemical spills on the road than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, avoid this movie and see one of his best. To scream out loud, the bits that Hitch made in the old TV show were more fun than anything else that this movie can not deliver.
