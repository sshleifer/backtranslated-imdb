It's a shame that high-quality actors and actresses get involved with pure trash, probably because they were offered a lot of money. It is not one of the best moves of Helen Mirren's career. The performance of the "teenagers" is simply appalling, without the help of a script that is, in part, simply inept. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above the average box office scum, but this is actually below the normal level. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you see on TV when there is nothing better and you have drunk half a bottle of wine and are waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink it. other way.
