Genre: short cartoon without dialogue, African girl and lion. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Inki, the lion and the minah bird. <br /> <br /> What happens: a lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. There is also a Minah bird quite confusing. Is it in Inki or on the lion's side ...? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, this is bad enough for the poor Africans !! :-( I like that the main character, Inki (who is an African girl), is a nice enough main character, but they still represent her rudely and make the younger audience not feel like her, simply because IT'S HUNCHING! JONES! I do not like the lion very much and I think that the Mina bird has ALL THE MOMENT (I suppose) Personally, I prefer Charles M. Jones' Looney Tunes cartoons in the future. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this anyway, then I recommend the YouTube website, just type "Inki" in the space on the homepage and you're already there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones had I was kinder to Inki in this brief, so there. <br /> <br /> Recommended for: people interested in old cartoons and / or people who are just playing on You Tube.
