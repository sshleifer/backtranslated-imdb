If a movie can not maintain its interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept that you simply have to deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later does not make sense. A good movie has to start and end strong. Everything seems interesting, some decent shots and many promises, but finally confusing and irrelevant. There are so many other Asian movies to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this and look elsewhere. Why exactly does IMDb require a minimum of 10 lines for revisions? I said my article and I hope this helps some of you to move on to the next movie.
