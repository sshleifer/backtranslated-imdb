The 20th Century Fox Road House, 1948) is not only a foolish noir, but is an implausible unmitigated hole in a movie. Filled with unconvincing cardboard characters, it is written gently by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, whom one would expect much more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the lead role! Lupino, a lady who was able to exude as much sex appeal as an orange blood, is here under the illusion that it is Rita Hayworth playing the role of a sexy singer of the Torch. The handsome Cornel Wilde as his lover is as wooden as usual and totally untapped is the talented Celeste Holm, whose role is little more than a small part. Then, we have Richard Widmark, who has the most ridiculously written part of the image. When we see it for the first time, it's a good O.K. boy who runs a prosperous road house. Then, suddenly, and for reasons that are not clear enough, he becomes terribly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry Lupino. You see that Widmark wanted to marry her, but - 1) never proposed marriage - 2) never had a relationship (they do not even have anything that looks like a love scene together) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino) ) has obtained a marriage license. Woohoo! So, how was it that Widmark achieved something like conjugal happiness with Lupino after such "courtship" is anyone's quess? Eh Well, when Widmark gets rid of the whole thing, so does the movie that I'm sorry to say. From now on, the character of Widmark becomes involuntarily comical! His loss of marbles so early in the procedure is totally implausible and unconvincing. Finally he goes over the edge, he is completely upset and with a few snorts from Tommy Udo, he laughs wildly at poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust. <br /> <br /> And if that is not enough. of a film for you: the image is also marred by the constant use of studio equipment and interior exteriors. There is not a single outdoor shot in the whole movie! Added to this, 95% of the film takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, the extras also include a "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". Whatever has caused such a documentary surpasses me! As far as I know, they had never been together in a movie on Fox or anywhere else before. However, this specialty is organized by experts from heavy hitters such as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and some others who surprisingly praise this annoying and indifferent issue. All I can say then must be me, I suppose. But "Road House" until now was a forgotten and buried Noir and, as far as I'm concerned, it should have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> Fox would do better if he issued DVD from a superior and hitherto elusive Widmark. Films like "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
