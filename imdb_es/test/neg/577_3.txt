I must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but this was not what I expected. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the most part, which should have been, because I did not like the two bedmates with problems. It was horrible. Poor Tom Selleck! He had to act with someone who was very much in the picture, whereas it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the movie. They were the only believers. And the only really fun parts were starring, not Kate Capshaw and that boy from Everett. Great, that mummy is coming out of the closet, I thought it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw it on the cable and I did not pay money when renting it.
