To be honest, I've never been to the Congo or even in Africa, and after watching the TV movie Heart of Darkness, I do not think I want to. The film completely undoes the book at the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best he had read, after watching the movie, he seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. Nicolas Roeg, the director of the film, did an awful job depicting Joseph Conrad's novel in a movie. I give Roeg some credit for trying to do the impossible by turning the book into a movie, but this may not have been the work for him. The film failed to express any part of the novel that was not the basic plot. The stage and the stage also lacked the beauty that Conrad portrays of Africa in the book. In the book, Marlow had seen so many wonders, but in the movie you did not get the same experience. No, I'm not blaming the director for everything; The acting in the movie was just terrible. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the whole movie I felt as if the actors did not present any emotion, as if they were reading the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not represent well the meaning of Marlow's adventure for his trip to the Congo. Marlow's trip to find Kurtz was supposed to be adventurous, but I did not experience that in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you've already read the book. It does not come close to doing justice to Joseph Conrad's novel. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with Marlow, in his quest to find Mr. Kurtz, where the film did not. A great novel, but a very poor movie. Heart of Darkness, the movie, is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad, also called Heart of Darkness.
