Although I found the acting and the cinematography beautiful, I was very disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the significant parts of the novel is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to commit suicide, instead of continuing. This is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledge accident. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost nonexistent. While in the novel almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it seems that both are invalid. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mattie and Ethan consummate their relationship and almost destroy the power and sharpness of the ending. . <br /> <br /> The change from the narrator to being a preacher was an effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are excellent in their performances. Joan Allen was also wonderful, however, her character was much diluted from the Whartons novel. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the films to faithfully represent the novels, but this one went too far and almost destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have read the book, as it will come out confused and disappointed.
