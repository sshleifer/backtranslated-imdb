Intertwined points of view may appear as a good idea in some movies. Here is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> But the total disaster begins with the story: a video-clip bummy wants to shoot a light comedy with a pernicious female character similar to the noir. She is beautiful and no man could resist scuba diving, crawling and sucking on her toes. She is even more materialistic, and it seems that the butter would not melt in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The film melts in its own pretension: to be intelligent / funny / pretty. Phalocretinism the best. Only white trash, please.
