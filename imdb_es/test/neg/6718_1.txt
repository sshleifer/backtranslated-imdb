Lord, have mercy! Why was this movie made? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to be in it? The Stranger is so unbearably bad in every possible way that it stuns the mind. <br /> <br /> The movie has an ultra-cheap look. As a budget of a couple of dollars was far out of reach. What is worse is that the manufacturers know it and try to make it look slippery to compensate. The result is a movie that just does not look good. The fight scenes are so boring and edited "discreetly" to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them is attractive or exciting. The plot is nonsense that does not interest you in the least nor does it have any singularity. The locations of Eastern Europe (a shrewd move by producers to keep the budget low or nonexistent) seem unpleasant and should not serve as a backdrop for an "action" movie (what action?). <br /> <br /> And what is the deal with the title? From what I could see, everyone in the movie was foreigners. What ONE does the title refer to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in anamorphic 1.85: 1 widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 sound. Nor are they remarkable enough to justify a single income. The foreigner is not worth a second of your time. I have to love that motto though! "If they think they can stop it, they are very wrong." Sheesh!
