This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera I've seen, it's also the worst video production I've seen of any opera. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of opera and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno does not even have a bird costume. He is only dressed like a boy. The sound is in mono. The color is very bad. It is saturated in orange. Most of the DVDs of this period have the color restored digitally, but they did not bother with this one. In addition, the language has been changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie version of "The Magic Flute". It's a filmed performance and it's not a good performance and it was not filmed very well. You can choose any other DVD available from this opera and I guarantee that it will be better than this one. My preference is for the version directed by James Levine with sets by David Hockney.
