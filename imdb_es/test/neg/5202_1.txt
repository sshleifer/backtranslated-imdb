This is a horrible movie from almost every point of view. As noted a lot in previous reviews, let me focus on the "Serbian" and "Delta Force" types in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms worn by the "Serbs" are not Serbian. And the helmets are also wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who play "Serbs" do not speak Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, unlike "Behind the enemy lines", where the Czech actors did their job. It is better to speak the language and add at least some credibility to the movie. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-bearded "Serbian general" looks and acts like an imbecile, firing his weapon every time the US soldiers. UU They call it name: <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! Surrender!" <br /> <br /> - Stupid general of gray beard: (shoots his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier US: "Gravic! Get out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shoots his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US Soldier US: "Gravic! Is surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shoots his AK47) <br /> <br /> - Prop boy: "Excuse me, Mr. Baronius, gray-bearded general, see, we have run out of space and I sent the boy to buy a little more, but he has not come back yet ... "<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when does the Army issue AK47 to the Delta Force? I guess they could not find enough functional M4s in Bulgaria, but there were many old AK47s and practice spaces;) Maybe they should have gone for some airsofts, they are cheaper and they would not have damaged the film's credibility anyway. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In the scene in which a DF official hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger all the time. No person in their right mind with weapons or simply common sense would. I guess the actor thought that his level of coolness increased the longer he held the weapon that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to common sense.
