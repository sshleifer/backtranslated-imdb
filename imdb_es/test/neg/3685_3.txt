This line is a good summary of this movie. If you read it and saw 20 minutes of the movie, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie will behave. An investigator named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) is looking for hell in the underworld of Moscow. However, he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Oven follows him with a team to look for him. Could they have found a more boring plot? Some bad actors look after an old man in the underground. The acting is very bad, the romance really feels useless and false, often there is no good reason for the way the characters act, nothing is scary and, above all, nothing interesting happens in the whole movie. They just walk around, they ask some gang leaders and other guys on the road, they walk a little more, they complain a bit, they find the old man and then they run, and finally they find the exit of the subway. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me this film the lowest rating of all the qualifications is the environment. If you just want to watch a movie for that, this may be a good option. It is dark, and it is mystical and turbid. However, the rest of the movie is really boring. You just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something to happen. Actually, some things are happening, but they are not very well done. For example, I did not really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I was not sleeping or something. And I do not understand what is dangerous with these children ... They just run in the underground together, scratching the walls with sticks (I suppose you're supposed to scare them somehow). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you have an immediate need for some murky atmospheres.
