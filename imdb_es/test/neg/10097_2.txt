Eric Roberts "stars" in this movie from Tommy Lee's debut prison Thomas. He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. Although evil to most people, your character is the kind of person who is kind enough to give you support cables while you are hanging chained to the ceiling while torturing you with the electric "deadly weapon" clamps. <br /> <br /> The movie has an intricate argument about corruption in prisons that makes no sense. Thomas has the eyes of Clint Eastwood, the ones from a line of Dolph Lundgren, the acting skills of JCVD ​​and the body of the smallest guy you met at the school that took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the film it is difficult to know if the character of Kove is supposed to be drunk throughout the film or if Kove came from that way. I could not blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for everyone involved, this movie has a quality "so bad that it's good" that it can be fun IF YOU DO NOT ABSOLUTELY HAVE ANYTHING BETTER THAN DO.
