This movie makes as much sense as an episode of 'Ozzie & Harriet' or 'Father Knows Best'. An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would provide more information about modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this strange mix. <br /> <br /> He surprised me with Diane Keaton. She seems to walk asleep through the movie. (Given the title of the film, I realize that his was a supporting role, but even Martin Short achieved a different character and support). <br /> <br /> I can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. But this movie is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I am afraid to think that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.
