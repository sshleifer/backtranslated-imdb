I was invited to see this movie in a small exhibition of the art museum. I had no idea what to expect. Initially, I was optimistic in the opening credits to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. However, after some very disturbing scenes (which did not contribute much to the advance of the story), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. The trick of the story of a growing vestigial arm never really develops. Patiently I kept waiting for this movie to collect money. There was a small reward at the end, but having to invest and sit through the endless thick, raw, sexually perverted, screams in your face, gore without grace cost me too much (even for a free viewing). What were these established actors doing in this horrible movie? The art direction was very convincing and scary. At a minimum, it should only be a 75-minute movie. This is a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would embrace.
