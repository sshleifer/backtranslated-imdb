The beginning was decent; The end was correct. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film suffers from total and absolute brazenness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations / fighting scenes, lack of someone intelligent outside the shuttle. This makes for a horrible middle script. <br /> <br /> Things to look for: omens too obvious, quick healing cuts, too smoldering fires, fun seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 4, not a 0, because the beginning of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and development of basic characters. The relationship between the main, dark-haired girl and her fiancee is discussed briefly, and the location of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present, albeit uncomfortably. The business discovered in the end is becoming more general and decently done, however, as another commentator pointed out, not unexpected. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
