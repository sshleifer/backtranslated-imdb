I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this movie. She is my favorite actress, every role she plays is always done so well. His character is cunning, sarcastic, intelligent, cheerful, fun and cunning. She really does this role well and gives you an idea of ​​what her character is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. Music is the most entertaining thing left. One of the characters has this strange circular radio that she brings with her, while she wears her tight T-shirt with zebra stripes. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a bit intriguing about the story was the idea of ​​someone hiring these three college age children to fix an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and tells them: go. That would be very fun and I wish someone would give me that opportunity! Imagine going to an old abandoned theater with two other people and deciding how to decorate and fix it. You have total control over the entire building. That would be so fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of this as a great task. They walk with long faces and fight with each other all the time. It is a kind of annoyance. But it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people are not even excited about. <br /> <br /> The movie does a good job of making you feel helpless or a little scared by the cinema itself. However, the performance (in addition to Woronov ... and possibly Murdoch, the boss, simply because it makes a smiling and fake businessman have very good money and never gets lucky) is really horrible and you just end up feeling dissatisfied. In addition, the random slapstick is a little sticky and in a way ruins the reality that the movie tries to create. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you discover Mary Woronov, the electronic rhythms of the Casio keyboard style of the 80s, and if you think so. A gigantic theater abandoned for you is intriguing.
