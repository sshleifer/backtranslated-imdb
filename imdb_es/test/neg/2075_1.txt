This movie has been promoted in all parts of Spain with a great advertising campaign, after seeing it, you realize that someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is horrible as Carmen, it is not natural and she seems to be making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots ("the best" is when she, as an Andalusian woman ... can speak Basque and fluently, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her, but the story is very slow, the plot does not work and the script is really very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen . <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
