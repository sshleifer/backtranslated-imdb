Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent film that unthinkingly uses the Middle East conflict as a backdrop for an action film prepared for a comfortably protected US audience in the Midwest. The conflict, like those involved, is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who proudly kill the Arabs for the sake of "freedom." But what's worse is that the action scenes in the film are handled carelessly and unattractive, which prevents Navy Seals work even as nonsensical nonsense. <br /> <br /> The character of Charlie Sheen (Hawkins) is disgusting, hateful, ignorant, reckless and, above all, racist. It refers to the Middle East as a 't ** hole' and its inhabitants as 'rag-heads'. Throughout the film, Navy Seals characters are glorified by the use of Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They indiscriminately massacre these people with an attitude free of consequences. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese man who was shot by Hawkins; Hawkins taunts his language before shooting him while making another humorous joke. Besides being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (though predictable) pro-American stance of the film is also disgusting. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American journalist informs Hawkins that terrorists can not be made to speak because "they are religious fanatics." Hawkins then answers with 'yes, and we are the Navy Seals!' The implication is, obviously, that the fans do not make sense next to the US military power. Furthermore, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating it as a sexual object, the script demands his inability to resist this disgusting thug and even ends up sleeping with him, because it is a seal of the All-American Navy. This marginalizes the character of the journalist by making her submissive to Hawkins' pro-American "superior" attitude despite her insulting behavior towards her. Beyond ethics, this twist of the plot also has little credibility as drama. <br /> <br /> The script is also amateur. Most of the scenes simply come together without thinking about the mood, the plot or the development of the character. The scene of the 'music video' on the golf course, for example, is simply an eye candy edited with poor quality. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also useless. In one of them, he jumps off a bridge from the moving car just to show his teammates how hard it is, and in the other, chases a tow truck on a push bike and pushes it. Neither of the two scenes has an anti-climax tracking, both are highly unlikely, and none is related to the plot as a whole. They are just candy designed as a vehicle to show the heroic and completely American Hawkins, and are poor substitutes for the development of character. Most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly written, in fact, this affliction affects the entire movie. Apart from the seal of the African-American Navy and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, all the other members of the team seem unknown to the public, so that when the climatic scenes roll there it seems that nobody supports them. The death of anyone to lament. <br /> <br /> In a movie like this, action sequences can potentially rescue production. But here they do not. These are poorly directed, poorly lit and exhibit poorly performed stunts. In fact, their orientation is so deficient that they are almost incoherent for the viewer, which makes the scenes incomprehensibly difficult to follow, but also a complete lack of fear and suspense. Bad lighting only increases your impotence. The explosions seem false, the bullet wounds are not convincing and one of the most daring stunts, involving crashing a Mercedes on a tank, looks like a maneuver that was made in a backlot and then was poorly edited. <br /> <br /> The end of Navy Seals places the coins firmly in the eyes of this production. First is the obligatory scene of 'running away from the big explosion that should have died' with Sheen carrying Biehn on his back. Obviously, this was the predetermined scene that pretended to be the star of the advances of the film. Then there is the end in itself when a submarine rescues the rest of the Seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean. This submarine, in fact, had become his home much earlier, but, of course, he had miraculously returned at the last moment. Putting an end to everything, despite the violent and stressful experience of the Seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues had just been killed, and some of them were still bleeding acutely, they all manage to laugh eagerly while blessing the United States with lust. Foreseeable? You can only imagine this ending while watching the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film uses the conflict of the Middle East as a vehicle for the macho tendencies of the photogenic young people of the Americans. Arabs are treated condescendingly and disdainfully, and their slaughter in the film is used as a point of support to glorify the use of US military power against a "lower" minority group in an environment without consequences. The events of 2001 have pointed out that such conceit and confidence in the trivialization of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence of free pastime. The Middle East can no longer be dismissed as a big hole full of crumbling rag heads (to quote Charlie Sheen here); Now it is a place where participation can lead to serious consequences. Today we remember that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home. Therefore, in the least, the Navy Seals look pretty dumb these days; But this is being kind. This is a highly ignorant film, whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspect. Navy Seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience.
