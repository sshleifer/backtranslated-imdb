If, like me, you enjoyed the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice is that you do not wake up your hopes too much; In fact, ignore any hope you have for this movie if you are over 12 and have some sense of cinema. <br /> <br /> Without revealing too much, the story sees Evan (Bruce's nemesis is anchor of the first movie) moving home with his family to the suburbs of Virginia to "Change the world" with a new path politician. What follows is a pretty crazy plot and quite 'silly', which is obviously aimed at young children as the main target audience. Unlike his predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of "comedy" and his deceptive "sequel" position that some would consider a comedy classic to be enjoyed today. a scene a little more mature. audience. <br /> <br /> In general terms, Evan Almighty is composed of terrible cinematographic values. The acting; omitting Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, it was rigid and many of the characters were apparently thrown out to use the unnecessarily large budget cast for production. In addition, the cast includes interim legend John Goodman, who appears as a heel and is seen only a few times in the entire film; However, I did not buy the character and I thought that the story I was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy. All the other characters in the film (especially the wife and the children!) Deserve a mention for their cheesy performance that could fill a king-sized Kiev. It is noticed however; It is the typical American cheddarfest that is associated with many traditional movies oriented to the family, so I advise you to defend yourself with the grater closest to your sight. <br /> <br /> It may seem that the movie has no value so far, however, it has -some- promising aspects. The CGI was outstanding and it became clear that he spent a lot of time modeling the Ark and producing water effects and animations of the computer generated animals towards the end. The particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although a part of me could not help, but I think they did not deserve a film with such poor ideals and that, in my opinion, they were "too good" for this piece of cinema and they took the film everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, I see this movie as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with enormous potential, but unfortunately it did not come to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and at the end of the film I had set my high expectations for an epic and a significant ending in some way to make up for the mediocre content I had witnessed so far. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused in the closing credits. When I sat down I could not help it, but I think the movie was not as powerful as I expected. In many ways, the film reminded me of a "Night at the Museum" diluted, as it showed a similar style and characteristics, but unfortunately there were leagues below that. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10, As you can see, but you definitely have to avoid it! If you HAVE to watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment, as "a little entertaining" is the best you can hope to get to see that production.
