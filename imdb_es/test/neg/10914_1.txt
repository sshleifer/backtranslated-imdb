<br /> <br /> Man, I just can not believe this movie. I've seen it completely (believe me, I've done this!) And the best part were the traillers at the beginning (and I hate the traillers!). <br /> <br /> There is no argument, I do not act, nothing. I was watching the movie and thinking, "When will this start?" It never started. How can people spend money and time to do shit like that? <br /> <br /> The "plot": a dog is bitten by a bat and rages - Well, so far there is no problem, nothing special, but it's fine. Now the rest of the movie will be - The Dog will chase people !!! that's it, nothing more Now add to this some of the worst acts / actors I've seen, some completely unrealistic scenes (and some really idiotic ones, like the child can not breathe and the mother gives her a strong and strong hug to see if it improves). and a very bad ending, that's all, here's CRAP ... ops! .... WHAT? <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more worthy, like banging your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO of 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
