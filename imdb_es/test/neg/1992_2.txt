Cowardly and cynical, 'The Hospital' represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special brand of celebrating the status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous script becomes ugly visually, the presentation of poor pace that it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only a great performance by George C. Scott, in the kind of petty role for which he was born, makes 'The Hospital' a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, however, Scott's performance makes the spectators a bad service. Their magnetism keeps them watching when they could turn off the VCR and clean the cabinets, look at the clouds or watch the 'Baywatch' replays. <br /> <br /> Certainly, anyone who invests emotionally in the configuration _ modern medicine has apparently gone mad _ will feel cheated by the unfortunate reward, where Chayefsky reveals that the system works well, so leave your carping . <br /> <br /> While the first half of this film provides a bit of entertaining black comedy, everything turns out to be a false track. However, before that is clear, Chayefsky gives Scott some good lines as his middle-class, middle-class white male understudy. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Dr. Herbert Bock of Scott has alienated those who know him better, and he has the bile to continue alienating them. In Chayefsky's worldview, all of that, of course, makes Bock a magnet for a hippie girl half his age. <br /> <br /> Playing a collection of adjectives, the Diana with long hair, long legs, ruthless and almost without busts. Rigg fights in the part of `the girl '. The British Rigg is a mistake as a free spirit of the Southwest, but any other actress would also fight. Like the rest of a good cast that has been spoiled, Rigg can not overcome a script that is not interested in any character, except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, this is another star turn and it's worth seeing. For fans of the black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For no one else, do not bother.
