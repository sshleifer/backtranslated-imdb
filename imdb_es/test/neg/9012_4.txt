What a parody of injustice qualifies a movie: a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Friends, this is much closer to a 3.0, I'll even risk it and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on, how can you have a movie about a network of static electricity that surrounds the earth and extraterrestrial amorphous cell structures, and not give you at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you have all that great dialogue like: "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I do not think they'll go back to that mud. It does not matter, this is the kind of movie that fans of the 'Z' movie live on, and now I can rest easy. In fact, I saw it a few years ago without due recognition, along with Corman titles such as "The Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman." I do not know what the fascination might be, but to quote a character from the movie: "Whatever it is, it works fast!" <br /> <br /> Going back to that extraterrestrial amorphous cellular structure, I liked the idea of ​​a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) came back from the dead, I had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to "Alien" in 1979, but it was not like that. In contrast, budget constraints limit the image to a Big Bird impersonator without feathers, despite the fact that a decade was still missing for that concept. Who knows where he leaves one idea and takes another? <br /> <br /> Look, this is not so bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Whenever you can connect hard-landing astronauts with alien beings committed to taking control of Earth, you have a winning combination. Launch the corny monster factor and you'll be on your way. Just remember: "A wounded animal that is not good".
