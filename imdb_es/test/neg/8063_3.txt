I bought this thing used in the "liquidation container" of a video game store. I wanted to get that feeling of guilt by seeing something that I was warned to be too intense to see; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad for seeing a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so cheesy and false. Most of the time, the camera does not show the "stabs", chops, slices "impressive", only the consequences are seen. (They show a breast latch in detail). The special effects are fine. Nothing here that tells you anything about violence is real. The "cannibals" are obviously poor people from Central / South America who disguised themselves as savages from the jungle and were told to act badly. These people were obviously in the full picture to get some money, food or both. Once again ... it just is not convincing. <br /> <br /> However, as everyone else has said, a real animal slaughter is taking place here. That is the scope of realism. For me, that was more shocking than any gutting, scalp cutting or castration, and even then, animal deaths are not so bloody at all, maybe just sad.
