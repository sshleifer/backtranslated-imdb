One hundred and seventy-five million dollars is a lot of money to spend even on summer's biggest box-office success. Not even Michael Bay had such a big budget for the Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent so much money making Evan Almighty a mystery. Certainly, they did not spend it on the script for one thing, since the film is not so much a classic comedy as is the Christian flag and one or two quiet giggles, the most likely is that they spend the duration wondering where the budget is. He left or why Steve Carrell felt the need to go to a neighborhood in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile began to rise. <br /> <br /> A sequel to Jim Carrey's comedy Bruce Almighty, this movie sees former backup character Evan Baxter (Carrell) climbing the ladder into the player's main slot. The story begins with him leaving the news desk to become a public servant and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic children (a slightly odd elementary school moppet, a high-spirited high school student and a sullen teen) . Evan's bet to change the world through politics, however, has a key in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's an update on the old Genesis story, with Evan fighting cynicism and detractors to build the immense ship. Unfortunately, although the premise is reasonably promising, it unfortunately does not provide much laughter. You can have a bit of fun at the beginning, where Evan's MP tries to juggle the demands of public service with the evil packets of animals that follow him and a beard that resists all attempts to shave, but as soon as possible. possible. As he accepts his divine mission, the film plummets. <br /> <br /> As of this moment, it becomes a message film. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps popping up to offer kindly wisdom, while gently pressing his chosen ones in the right direction. However, without Evan's resistance, the only remaining trace of the comedy comes in the form of a few jokes of animal excrement and the role of John Michael Higgin as Evan's exasperated right hand. Higgins may show the same rich comedic potential he did earlier in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm can not save the sinking ship, especially since Carrell has put his formidable improvisational skills on the back burner. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it's a bit similar to the Passion of Christ, but unlike the Mel Gibson movie, which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood and guilt , Evan Almighty tries a kinder approach. The film simply tells us that we must have faith in God, because He has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is so likely to make you laugh like the Passion. Carrell is on autopilot, jokes do not exist and Wanda Sykes tries to become the most annoying person on the planet. It may be sweet, but someone has just thrown $ 175 million overboard.
