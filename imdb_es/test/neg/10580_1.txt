It turns out that I rented this movie with my sister hoping to see a great entertaining movie, which was funny, however my expectations were low. This movie was more than disgusting and disgusting for a PG-13 movie, this should have been rated with an R for the many mature references that occurred in this film. I would not recommend that a 13-year-old teenager see this. <br /> <br /> Even if no one under 17 is watching this movie, be careful with a really stupid movie, there is no humor in the movie. just a handful of disgusting sexual references that include a little touch of pedophilia, something that should not even be kidded. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened with the PG-13 movies, which were actually safe for a 13-year-old child. This is beyond a deplorable movie and should be reclassified.
