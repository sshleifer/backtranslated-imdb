I'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically could not qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give it a try because I love war movies. In the best case, it was mediocre. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems totally out of place in this role. It just did not work for me. Julie Andrews probably did her part as best she could, but I find it difficult to buy her as a deceptive and deceitful spy. I'm sorry, I know it's a classic stereotype on my part. But I have to say that I think this is Julie in her most beautiful and feminine aspect. I always thought of her as something more common, but surely that is the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt, they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecast in this role. She was pretty seductive in appearance here, but I still did not believe her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I could not concentrate on the whole movie and I found myself going in and out, and having conversations with those in my room (which I do not usually do, I'm always shutting everyone up). So that tells you how little caught my attention. Do not waste your time!
