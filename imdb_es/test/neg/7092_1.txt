The last time I checked, the Nazis did not win World War II, it's not like you've seen it. After all, the Third Reich was quite large in issuing orders and demanding the cold and robotic obedience of the population, and that is pretty much what we are burdened with today. But the way the orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked with a German accent through a loudspeaker, they are disguised as expert advice and float under your nose each time you turn on the television or open a newspaper. There is a continuous buzz, a middle class message of personal improvement, whispered to the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much, you eat the wrong things, you drink, you smoke, you do not exercise enough, you probably can not even * beep * properly, you will die if you do not change your way of life, your health will suffer. Do you have self-esteem? Look at yourself, you make me sick, I feel sorry for you, I hate you, we all hate you, "God hates you. You do not understand it? It's so sad what you're doing to yourself. It's so sad. "That's the mantra, and it goes without saying that the people who recite it are routinely portrayed as saints. Last year, the media knelt to give Jamie Oliver a collective blowjob on his series School Dinners , in which he campaigned for healthier foods to be placed on school menus, given the slap reaction, they would forgive him for thinking that he personally rescued 5,000 children from the jaws of an enslaving pedophile. <br /> <br / > Anyway, the series was a great success, in fact, in terms of television there was only one real drawback: it was not returnable - after all, once it has saved all the children of the nation from certain death, The only solution is to find a new threat, which will take us to Unfit Kids by Ian Wright (Wednesday, 9 pm, C4), a weekly program of "prevention of emissions" in which the former footballer and famous The enemy of grammar forces a group of overweight youths to take part in an after-school Physical Education program. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a carbon copy of Jamie Oliver's program, with more sweating and fewer shots of students pounding fresh basil with one hand: an uplifting fable in which Wrighty shapes his band of misfits becomes a thin, mean machine, exerciser: fights apathy and lethargy, faces lazy parents and tries to turn all this into a national problem that will cause the mothers of Range Rover to brake their panties with pure sanctity between trips. to the Conran store. Oh, is not it just terrible, what these blob-some plebes do to themselves? You understand, not our Josh: he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practice 600 times a week. <br /> <br /> I bet yes, the little sh1t yes, it is touching to see flabby and inconvenient kids transform themselves with a little bit of simple activity ... but there is something about the underlying message of eating your vegetables that really sticks in my crawl, in case you have not guessed. <br /> <br /> What happened to the CHOICE concept, you * beep * So a bit of jogging could increase your life expectancy, so what? That only amounts to a few more years in the nursing home, which is good. And, besides, I'd rather die dead than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of snooty pulls that try to save each other. <br /> <br /> In episode two, video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war against flaccidity: they make children too sedentary, as you can see. Oddly enough, television, which is equally sedentary and, unlike these two activities, actively encourages him to let his mind atrophy along with his physique, and escapes without great amusement. It is funny. <br /> <br /> Listen well here, Channel 4: instead of forcing children to eat hello or squats, what do you think about teaching them to think more broadly, so they reject the cunning and cajoling nature? of the programs? I like this? Or would that be a campaign too far?
