This is one of those movies that you find when you get up too late and you only have a basic cable. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in '95, considering that it looks like something from the late 80s. Brave young people with varied problems at home face a crazy ice cream that has the mission to make the best taste: Soylent Cream! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely insane and only scary because of the creepy and absolute, ridiculously rude it is. Actually, the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems that these children face at home. The fact that these children can not escape their silent suburban sufferings makes any random assault in the neighborhood seem like a walk in the park. "Fat boy" is so obvious that he is a thin preadolescent with a mountain of pads under his baggy sweatshirts. I suppose either a) they had not invented / could not afford a fat suit, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a plump child star or c) we are supposed to believe that this child is hungry and a hugely distended belly. <br /> <br /> So if you get up at 2am and you need something ridiculous and disgusting to keep up with your intoxicated friends, go and take a look. Personally, I prefer to be sleeping.
