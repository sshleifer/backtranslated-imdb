Man that I loved Ocean's 11. <br /> <br /> Smart movie. All the eleven characters were crucial for the robbery, since each had its own specialized skill that was necessary to achieve the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What the hell was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I guess it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones, but she was not really a part of the 11, since she was trying to make them stumble and work the whole movie against them. It was more like the story of the boring relationship of the characters of Brad and Zeta-Jones with some fragments of the original movie released just to get some vagabonds in the seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, The gang was always one step ahead of Benedicto (Garcia). They were always able to make fun of him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a warning and, suddenly, are they all wrong? The whole movie is for them to raise the money that they stole plus the interest to reimburse Benedict for the robbery that they did 3 years before. So the next film will again develop courage and intelligence and return it for making you pay for the first robbery? Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> This movie could have been made only with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Slow motion movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to please myself and I am usually very easy to please, but I am really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The turn: it was not necessary to do the whole movie, since the real robbery was made before everything he saw in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait until it's on TV or if you're a fan of the original 2001, do not see it.
