Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramid structure killing all who approach. Yes, it's weird, since travelers do not discover it until everything starts to go crazy. And in a movie like this, I just wished it would become absurd and that the bands would be attacked by plants with machetes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from America go on vacation to the mountains with a couple of other freshly made German friends who know the place. When they got there, the Mayans began shouting at them and hid in the structure. And when it's there, that's when the plants decide to eliminate them, imitating the sounds of cell phones, humans and ancient Maya dead. <br /> <br /> Nothing was really scary about the movie and it was not even entertaining. Not even the strange ending could save this piece of shit. I kept looking for something really good to happen, but nothing. Oh good. "F"
