This movie is something horrible. I laughed all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mother thought that it is not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death seems ridiculous. Especially when the Tornado Tommy is absorbed by a tornado. <br /> <br /> The explosions of cars thrown at buildings by wind forces resemble those of the old-school side-scrolling game called R-Type. The dialogues are very bad and I'm interested in how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie. It's just amazing how such a bad movie can appear on television. <br /> <br /> The only real reason to watch this movie is to have fun without meaning and without meaning.
