A largely forgettable story in which the mercenary Kerman and businessman Agren travel to the jungle in search of Agren's lost sister. <br /> <br /> Despite his connection to the family of cannibalistic films, this film is more an extreme version of Rene Cardona's "Guyana - Crime of the Century". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit (at that time) the Jonestown topical massacre, representing a rogue, just and honest fanatic, with a penchant for bigamy and just a touch of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading to his numerous crew group towards himself. forgetfulness inflicted. With the sister standing, Kerman and Agren try to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing to the "Green Hell", only to enter into conflict with the locals and their notorious appetites. <br /> <br /> One in a series of excessive gore festivals that emerged in the late seventies and early eighties, where each new addition seemed to participate in a one-man contest with its predecessor, when trying to create the most bloody and graphic exhibition ever seen. . This inferior delivery employs all the motives and tricks of others, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Were the so-called "Amazonian natives" who seemed to have been rejected by Bollywood (this film was performed on the spot in Sri Lanka), or the inept scenes of "decapitation" and "castration" that diminished seriously the authenticity that was manifested in the "Cannibal Holocaust"? You can decide. Without ruining the conclusion, it seemed that Lenzi placed more emphasis on his shock and awe at the climax than on the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all the loose ends are resolved. The most unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As with the others, where the scope of the graphic representations of violence towards human beings is limited (fortunately), the filmmakers have spared no effort to inflict the worst possible cruelty to animals defenseless in their Persecution of the most sadistic clashes. Unfortunately, the only surprising thing about this movie is that it qualifies a mention, among other things, of the theme, which deals with the subject in a more convincing way. <br /> <br /> If there are traits redeemable, Kerman is a good-natured but somewhat unidimensional protagonist, and his group of underdressed co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide a visual respite from the relentless killings.
