This movie starts very well and absorbs you. Most of the performances are good until Patrick Swayze appears (with his Texas Twang, everyone seems British, even the Muslim), and shows that he can not act. You can live with that until the scene of the first fight, where they all fall apart. Why did Patrick Swayze fight the bad guys with an ax when he just put his sword on the ground 5 minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A few minutes later the swords went missing, and people know they should not know about. Other critics mentioned "Troubled Production" and it is shown. <br /> <br /> In the end, I just did not care about the fight scenes, of course, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest disappointment.
