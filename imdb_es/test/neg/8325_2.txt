This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that it focused on women who are socially engaged, having long-lasting jobs and friendships, but in situations where they can not afford housing. Interesting, but there was little focus or progression in the story. The address and editing did not manage to keep my attention. Of course, there were differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could have been said by focusing on any of them in more depth. <br /> <br /> I got to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty boring trip.
