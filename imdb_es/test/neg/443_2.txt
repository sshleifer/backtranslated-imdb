Maybe I'm too generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. However, like the movie "An American Werewolf," this is a missed opportunity! There are no real connections from the plot to the superior original, but the story is similar in some respects to "London." <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler warning * American children go to a foreign country, one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another child is killed by a werewolf on the same night that one is bitten and, despite the warnings of his undead friend, in the light of the full moon sprouts fur, fangs and claws. <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in the story, for example; The girl is one of the werewolves. Second; there are three American children And third; There is something weird - @ $$ Werewolf cult with the intention of conquering the world! As crazy as it sounds, the last one, IT WAS NOT a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> Movies suffer from many things, first the weak action drags him immensely! The performance of Tom Everret Scott is amatuerish at best, and he and Julie Delpy, who are interested in their love, do not seem to have any chemistry together. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy, which made the original great, are missing in this one. And who said that eating the heart of the werewolf that bit you will make you become human? The last time I heard this was not part of the werewolf tradition. Third; terrible special effects; The effects of the werewolf are done with computer animation, which works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But it seems choppy, fake and artificial, when used for furry creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there were some things that saved this one from the "turkey" total, there is a hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy), drops a pile of condoms on the table and try to swallow them like chewing gum, chewing and blowing a bubble! As well; The soundtrack, a very good mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word "moon" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great, however. And another funny scene when a rotten corpse, played by Julie Bowen, tries to whistle and her eyeball appears, made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> But in general, this film seems to lack intelligence and suspense. of the original. And the excessively artificial ending does not help much either. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half five stars (average).
