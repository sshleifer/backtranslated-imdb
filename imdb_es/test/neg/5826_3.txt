First I must point out that I used to love Winnie The Pooh as a child and I really enjoyed The Tigger Movie even though I am 20 years old. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that it embarrassed me. I've been a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> Ok, OK I know this is a children's movie and it's not aimed at people like me anyway, but this is my opinion about the movie for other people my age. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this movie is the blow itself, it has to be the most annoying character I've seen in a children's movie (possibly even more annoying than the Monsters Inc kid). He has the most annoying voice and vibrates singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments. I know that Pooh's films are not exactly of great importance, but this was insulting to the intelligence of a 2-year-old child! <br /> <br /> Second - Where was the story? Pooh's previous exits had a point in the story, yes, I can see that it was about accepting people who are different for you in your hearts, but it really ended and I felt I had seen a 5 minute caricature on children's television. <br /> <br /> I do not have my own children, but when I have them, I intend to show them quality children's movies like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (although they are too childish for me these days I can see how they would be of great appeal to young children). Not so with this atrocious attempt to see a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing: IT'S NOT ENOUGH, Eeyore! I should have your own movie!
