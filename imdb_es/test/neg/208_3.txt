The movie had moments, but it was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a remake of Trespass (Walter Hill) and, therefore, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bites and human emotions. There was a good performance, but the story was lazy and lacked real depth. I saw the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, neither was inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin. This movie was killed in the past and did not have to be made, it eats the money that could be used in better films. For an action movie it was short on action and as a thriller it did not excite. Better to see snow fall, but not for me.
