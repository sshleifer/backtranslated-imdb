What the fuck is that movie. The script is simply non-existent. The movie sometimes looks like a music video. But it can not even be that, since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. One might think that it is a recipe for a successful movie ... here it fails miserably. The dialogues in this movie killed me. The scene in which Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is simply regrettable. In general, recent Seagals movies can barely be seen. What the hell happened to the boy? I know he's old, but can not he get "Hollywood" to leave a decent script or something? Are you running out of money for your getaways to India that assume anything that is served?
