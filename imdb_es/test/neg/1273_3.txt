Yes, I had the misfortune to see this film when I was younger in a friend's house, since his mother was a teacher and wanted to see the film and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent could object to. Well, apart from the jokes without grace, I think this was clear, well the jokes without grace and the strange scene in which Ernest hits a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into jail thanks to a similar aspect and proceeds to try to escape and there are other things like magnetize at one point, shoot electricity and it is very painful to watch the final flight. There are a couple of jokes, but there is not much to mention except the weapon carved in soap ... I think that's the only scene in which my friend's mother or my friend's mother laughed out loud. This and the camp are the only two Ernest movies I've seen and from what I've seen in them I'm not going to track the other movies. Ernest was good in small doses, but a movie is too much, even when it is as short as this one. I guess the movies made money, mainly because all you need is Varney and a location and a theme, and you have your movie.
