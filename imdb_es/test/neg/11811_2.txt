Well, that's how this should have been called, anyway. Mainly, due to the ridiculous and energetic use of what the director can hardly call symbolism. I would not have been surprised to discover that this was A) One of the first efforts of Lea Pool, and B) at least semi-autobiographical. It turns out that A is wrong, although I do not know anything about B. I bet she attended a boarding school, though, and she had a pretty terrible relationship with people of the same sex. This is the message that hit us in the throat for this movie, and the short film that preceded it, whose name I no longer remember. <br /> <br /> In any case, the development of the character was clumsy (Who does he say by saying what his name means? Nobody.) The symbols were as subtle as a glass elevator full of teenage girls who lost a cable and plummeted eighty floors. For all a speaker. Honestly, the cry of a hawk when Perabo declared that she was a raptor and jumped from the table? That was ridiculous to the point of parody. And it was just one of many symbols meant to show even the stupidest spectators what she wanted to say. And it was that he had a horrible childhood and feels the need to make films about it, wing Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us who move on with our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing moving in this movie. It was an act of poor quality, and the actors could not save Brett Ratneresque over the use of film, writing and acting techniques in "HEY THIS IS MY POINT OF THIS MOVIE". I'm sorry, but it was terrible.
