Tyrone Power was thrown to the head like Solomon. However, in the middle of the movie he died unexpectedly. The studio chose to take Yul Brynner to the head and re-shoot the scenes that Power had made. In retrospect, considering how horrible this movie was, Power was lucky, as this would have been a horrible way to end his charming film career. <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics I've seen, this is by far the worst, and that's a lot because Hollywood has done so many boring biblical stories, so many wonder if the creation of these! movies were an atheist conspiracy !! In fact, the film was so boring that it was deservedly included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The fifty worst movies of all time". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst is how incredibly heavy all this was! Of course, playing people with an Italian, Eastern European, Scottish, and English accent to play Egyptians and Israelis was bad enough, but at least it made the movie strangely funny. The fact that Gina Lollobrigida played the role of a woman who was supposed to come from a place in Ethiopia was also horrible, but at least she was beautiful, even if she could not act. The fact that George Sanders, overweight and middle-aged, played such a young role was also pretty bad, but at least he had a pretty voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and openly boring was pretty bad, but at least you could see in the credits a mention of a person as the "orgies choreographer". No, the worst thing about this movie is that for almost two and a half hours, it seemed that there were nine of them, that they had such a poor and insipid rhythm! Keeping in mind that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in some miserable verses in the Old Testament, it is amazing that the film has followed and continued and followed. THE GREATEST STORY THAT WAS A LITTLE LONG, but that movie was based on four gospels, not a dozen verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie is wrong in virtually every respect (except for Gina's neckline). Even for devout Christians and Jews, this is a film that should be avoided because it reproduces very quickly and with the truth, in addition to injecting an incredible amount of sex into a biblical film! Terrible in almost every way, it really is a blessing for Tyrone Power who is not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey.
