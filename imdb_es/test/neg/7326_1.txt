Again, this kind of digital video camera garbage without a budget. and again I fell into this trap because the title had "zombie" (German title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) The story: on Halloween, some people visit the "Museum of the dead" is a trap that a crazy doctor wants to kill . The people, everything related to some Aztec cult. so they fight against some zombies there. <br /> <br /> Ultra-cheap stage: some corridors with black tape on it. A few dilettant drawings and some skulls, as you can find in each fun store. without actors, only low quality models that wake up without the slightest idea of ​​what to do. no effects. Laughter makeup, your local hobby, makeup artist, zombie-fan will make it better, once it seemed that they did not have enough money for enough color, otherwise, they just could not do it like that, man, have To realize the appearance of his "zombies". Some laughs of martial arts fights with the zombies, in slow motion. Simply, when the director wants him to be afraid, he uses a standard digital video camera effect where everything is useless. amazing! 0 out of 10!
