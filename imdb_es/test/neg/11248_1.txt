This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this film was basically a group of stereotyped black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfair objections. I did not laugh once during the whole movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in the United States and listened to these banal jokes, and maybe even came out with a decent haircut. I can not understand why this mess got rave reviews, let alone why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here was funny or worth worrying about. I really did not care if the rival barbershop across the street would cause Nappy Cutz to go out of business. Do not waste your money on this, folks, since that is the only way to stop Hollywood from producing these pieces of shambolic trash. 1 out of 5
