A story of coming of age about a teenager who revolts against the church and his minister father in a small Norwegian village. The country setting is picturesque, but the story is quite pretentious and laborious, and much of the film is devoted to quoting the Scriptures. It's like watching a religious propaganda movie. Theisen, who has made just one more film, is quite good as the young and sensitive protagonist, as is Sundquist as his strict father and Riise as a woman who fascinates Theisen. The aim of the film is to be fresh and charming, but it seems a bit old-fashioned and tired. The director and co-author Nesheim, who has worked mainly on television, is not up to the task.
