1st Seen 2/9/2008, 4/10 (Dir-J.S.Cardone): The sexual political thriller that really does not succeed in any of these areas very well, except from the beginning where there are some interesting scenes of soft core. The film begins by portraying a couple who explore their sexual fantasies in the midst of their work environments or anywhere and what suits them best. The couple makes an excursion to a retreat and a bathhouse where they meet a woman who is willing to be part of a group of three and fulfill some of her fantasies. At this point, we only know that this couple is fine, but we do not know until they return that the boyfriend is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a seat in Congress after marriage. Then they receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit photos of their meeting at the bathhouse and their qwest begins to explain how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want and how to clean their names. before any of this comes out This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them to delve into more sown worlds and takes a lot of time, to the point that their friends and family wonder what they are doing all day and why They see deteriorated all the time. This movie is interesting sometimes, but it becomes ridiculous to personally look for the problem instead of involving the police from the beginning because of their pride. This error, of course, keeps the movie going. The performances are fine despite the nameless cast, but the madness of the situation is nullified and the movie begins to get boring halfway. And, of course, they launch a turn at the end that challenges and challenges everything that happened before (as is the norm these days when they do not know what else to do to spice up the movie). However, this does not help a little to this movie.
