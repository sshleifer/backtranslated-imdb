I will start with some quotes from other critics who describe it better. <br /> <br /> "This is easily one of the most overrated movies of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino has ever made." "The ONLY thing in this movie was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "So I was very disappointed, and seeing this film in # 40 of the best films of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth open" Now, for More details, read the comments of "I hated it". <br /> <br /> One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats the audience as a group of dumb people. (Spoiler forward). Now I know that Tarantino's style is based on fantasies and fictitious plots, but, Adolf Hitler and 200 high-ranking Nazi officers will attend a premiere of the film in occupied France, and he only has two guards throughout the theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks freely with steel tubes that close doors and set fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds, opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler in a blank spot with about 100 rounds ... very foolish. At least, it challenges our intelligence and creates a more intelligent plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go see Valkyrie). Also, the Mike Myers personification of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the person who makes Hitler, just imagine that. <br /> <br /> What ruined him even more, is that the only intelligent and powerful character, who caught everyone in The Movie, with its psychological and hallucinatory questions, ends up being tricked without effort by the most carefree character in the movie. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, he sympathized with the Nazis, whom he represented. More courage and humanity than our Basterds! Imagine <br /> <br /> My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2 hours and 33 minutes to lose or if you want your mind to take a break, go see this movie.
