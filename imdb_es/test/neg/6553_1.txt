Sherman Hemsley was great in the Jeffersons and especially in All in the Family. He was also very good at Amen. Why the hell would this movie do? This movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does the best he can, but this is horrible. This movie was the beginning of the bankruptcy of Sherman Hemsley. I think he's very funny, but this is a tremendously useless ghost story. Stay with the Ghostbusters.
