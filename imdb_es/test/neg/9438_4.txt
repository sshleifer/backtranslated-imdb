I know that this movie was shown on local television when I was a child, but I can not remember if I saw it or not; Seeing it now, considering how completely forgettable it is, I still do not know. So I told it like a first sight! There have been several films with the title of the character, a creation of French visionary author Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA (1954, with James Mason in the paper), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961, Vincent Price), MISTERIOUS ISLAND (1961, Herbert Lom), CAPITAN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY (1969, Robert Ryan) and THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF CAPTAIN NEMO (1973, Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version stars the winner of the Academy Award, Jos√© Ferrer. However, even if the premise itself is not so bad? Aroused from the suspended animation on his submarine, "The Nautilus", and finding himself in modern times, Nemo adopts all his ingenuity to help the United States Navy defeat the megalomaniac scientist Burgess Meredith? The most childish adventure so far arises with the same ease! For example: five seconds in the movie, Meredith's assistant? Wearing a steel mask? says that "The world will be ours!"); equally funny are the jealous gestures of a dwarf with a similar outfit, whose task is to shoot the important "Delta Beam" of The Professor - and what about those henchmen of android type aboard Meredith's ship that seems to never do anything you are welcome? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity at all times, but Meredith is a disgrace (in what is practically a retread of his penguin characterization of the BATMAN television series of the 1960s and the movie) where the budget was so tight. Invested mainly in bland production design and poor quality special effects, without a doubt, and both evidently influenced by STAR WARS (1977). that, apparently, they could not even afford a decent suit (he looks positively idiotic using a tie on a sub). The supporting cast includes Mel Ferrer (portraying a saboteur in Joan Fontaine's vein of another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA [1961]), and engages in a dazzling routine with his namesake on the Machine room "The Nautilus", Lynda Day George (as expected, is the only female character) and Horst Buchholz (as the King of Atlantis, for some reason, Nemo is obsessed with the location of the famous Lost Continent) . <br /> <br /> By the way, having been reduced from a three-part miniseries to a theatrical show, the film obviously feels choppy, although one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began.
