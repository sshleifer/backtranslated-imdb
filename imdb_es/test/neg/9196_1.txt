This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clich√©s, unreal moments: hit the air in the celebration after putting out a fire, it does not matter that someone has lost their home and their possessions!, Announcing a pregnancy in a bar with all your companions before telling them in private first , walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, stereotyped funerals and tense relationships, arrogant and cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the unrealistic explosion from that same apartment! ! Did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something? Anyone with a gram of wit can see that this movie was a joke. It's a shame, because firefighters do an incredible job, and they deserve to have a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
