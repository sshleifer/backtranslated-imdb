This sequel is pretty horrible to be honest. I'm a fan of kung fu movies and this is by far the worst I've seen. Bride with White Hair 1 was pretty good and this is a big disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in some way with a single evil evil villain. <br /> <br /> The couple from the first movie had a small role in this movie. Instead, the film revolves around a group of uninteresting characters trying to avenge their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this movie, so revenge is mute. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is kung-fu or the lack of it. They literally had a street style knife fight. The character at the end refused to fight because choreography was missing.
