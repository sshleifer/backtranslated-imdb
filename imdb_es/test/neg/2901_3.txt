After the movie that represents the pinnacle of the ninja genre of the 1980s, the salivating fans of 'The Revenge Of The Ninja' were 'treated' with this strange offer that mixes the ninjas shenanigans with spiritual possession ... The final result is not different in nature from that somewhat horrific experience when one spies a nugget of human excrement floating menacingly towards oneself in a public pool. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the supposed "action-packed" introduction that is established in all places in a golf. Of course (!) Here we are witnesses of a ninja dressed in evil green that kills a group of golfers without any apparent reason (although I must admit that the superficial elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport bothers me ... hmmmm Maybe that's why he murdered them? ... Yes, I can relate to that after all). Actually, later in the film, we are told that one of the golfers was an important scientist, but this story is never elaborated or alluded ever again. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the introduction, the police proceed. to surround the golf course and basically shoot the assassin's absolute hell ... and they have to keep shooting him because he just does not stay down. Yes, literally, hundreds of rounds are pumped to him and STILL rises to kill more and more the numbers of the forces of public order. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what seems an eternity) our malefactor detonates a smoke bomb and disappears ... ... or so it seems, because in reality it is simply hidden under the earth and about our officers decidedly without worms that leave the scene to look for his body, he leaves his hiding place and moves away. <br /> <br /> Next, we see the lovely Lucinda Dickey, a truly beautiful actress in excellent physical condition, here playing a telephone repair worker. From her high point of view, she discovers the moribund ninja (¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ A very detailed investigation, however, after a lot of research , the man, supposedly on his last legs, suddenly throws himself on her and pushes her to the ground.After a bit of fighting, our fighting heroine manages to free herself by luck, but she does not count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably It is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use his corporeal form to kill the officers who killed him (the few he did not actually eliminate initially! ) <br /> <br /> As of this moment, throughout the film, whenever our heroine sees one of the aforementioned officers who is subject to some cinematographic scenes overwhelmingly horrible flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed him levitating towards her in the most unstable way! <br /> <br /> To make things more complex, a particularly irritating police officer (who has enough hair on his back and shoulder to shame a yak) persists in trying to win his affection (in the way more bloody and annoying!) ... well of course, you do not need the gift of the preconceived idea to discover that, in a weak 'shock' (less) turn toward the end of the movie, it is revealed that HE is one of the officers he must kill! <br /> <br /> But hope that there is still some hope! <br /> <br /> The only Sho Kosugi advances! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja in person and here he looks as great as ever! The news of the golf club obviously travels fast and upon learning of the events mentioned there, it flies from Japan to resolve the situation (suspecting the worst!) In a brief secondary history (that amounts to a few seconds!) showed that Sho's interest in this particular ninja is personal after it is shown that the villain murdered the father / teacher (?) De Sho and blinded one of Sho's eyes (therefore, it is necessary for Sho to use a patch in the eye of the sword with a really decorative look!) <br /> <br /> After stealing the body of your dead nemesis from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an involuntary abode for the evil soul , it matters the climax in an oriental temple (apparently in the middle of nowhere) where our man Sho manages to reunite the two unconnected aspects. <br /> <br /> Now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho fight in the traditional ninja style with swords and the winner is ........ well yeah, you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> This movie has really Only two things in its favor: the always excellent Kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role of always) and the lovely Miss Dickey. What a pity that the material in which they were here is a pile of things so stale. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, to be fair, I've seen much worse than this in my time, although I certainly can not yet recommend this more than to those desperate to complete their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections.
