First of all, I must say that, in general, I'm not a big fan of werewolf movies. It's not that I do not like them, just that I do not like them very much. There are some of those that I have enjoyed ... Werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were good, but nothing special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but in general, the subgenus of the werewolf is not my favorite. But I had this in one of those 50 movie sets, so I thought about giving him a watch and seeing what it was like. <br /> <br /> The spoilers are still ... <br /> <br /> The Mad Monster is a werewolf tale, but the werewolf is mainly used as a revenge vehicle by a mad scientist, Dr Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts, specifically wolves, but was ridiculed and excluded by the scientific community in general. Forced to leave a prestigious position, he goes crazy and plans to take revenge on those who made fun of him in an old rural mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the charming Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) of mental skills limited. Using his serum, Dr. Cameron transforms Petro into a werewolf and sends him to kill his former rivals. However, in the end, the werewolf, Petro, gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed. <br /> <br /> The film is also presented as a murder / crime drama, with Lenora's suitor journalist (Johnny Downs) investigating the doctor's bizarre behavior and the eruption of murders. History seems to borrow many elements from other large images that came before. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster that goes crazy, and the creature that kills an innocent child. The visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) also come to mind. And that is one of the problems with this movie from my point of view: it is presented as a mediocre combination of some of the best movies. It does not add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> It's true, there are some redeeming qualities. The performance of George Zucco was convincing, and the scene that shows Dr. Lorenzo speaking with his visions / hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me to show his madness. There is a certain accumulation of reasonable character, at least in the case of his character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not entirely convincing, and he seems to have this comical quality, whether intentional or not, I'm not sure, that just does not fit into the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> I thought I liked it more than most IMDb users based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still a movie below average. Maybe it's worth seeing if you're a fan of the first werewolf movies or a big fan of the horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s, but it's unlikely to attract you if you're not.
