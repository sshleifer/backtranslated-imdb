This is the worst work of Daniel Day Lewis ... I can not believe that in the same year he made this horrible movie and My left foot ... Please, get away from this movie ... this is a movie only for Argentines as a curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ... The writer believes that in Argentina everyone speaks in English ... Of course, Patagonia brings a very good framework for taking pictures of the film, but that is not enough reason to see this movie ... I repeat, only if you are a fan of Daniel Day Lewis, or if you want to see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you do not have enough money to travel yourself ... .
