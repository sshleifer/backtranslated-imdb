I saw DEATH MACHINES as part of BCI Eclipse's Drive Class In Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. As I move through multiple sets of DVDs, I am beginning to love many of Crown International's films, especially the spooky, erotic and psychic thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After watching movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say that this is the worst movie. It has never been done; but, it does not have much in its favor. <br /> <br /> No argument; There really is no story to talk about. <br /> <br /> Is not the performance obvious? only the actor responsible for Tony, terribly played (with the thick and fake Italian accent) made any attempt to "get into character". <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is why ... what made the filmmakers make this movie? <br /> <br /> Did you think about the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two crime bosses in competition, 3) an auxiliary character of bartender / student of school karate; and 4) his unfortunate nurse of love interest was so convincing that the world would not be complete without this film being made. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, writers, actors and the director.
