Michael Caine could have tried to make a character bigger than life to a successful degree, but the whole story and the character around him were not pleasant or interesting at all. Everything was very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, one of my favorite actors, had no role. It was useless. Michael Caine got a little irritating after a while and the movie could not decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard for him, but I felt that the direction and the plot disappointed him. Do not waste your time. It starts well during the first 10 minutes and that's it. A movie for Die Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this ...
