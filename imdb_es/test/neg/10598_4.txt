Actually I was waiting for this movie. The commercials made it look really cool and full of action. And I heard that the character of Claire Daines was arrested for assault, so I thought maybe I would kick her a lot and that would be great. BUT NOOOOOOOO !! There was no action at all and the character was somewhat insipid. The only one who saved was Omar Epps and even he did not help much to this movie.
