Oh darling! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal to absorb dramas of the time. I agree that this Jane Austens novel is difficult to portray, particularly for a modern audience, the heroine is not an Elizabeth Bennet, not even Edmund is calculated to make female hearts skip a moment. However, I must say that I expected an improvement in the last and unfortunately I was disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, mood, feeling, wit, depth, diluted, if not lost. If some past adaptations can be seen as outdated, the weakness of this should be that it is too modern ("Is your life a long party?") The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was wrong. choice, I needed someone else restrained, I did not have the impression of hidden depths under a submissive exterior, she was more like a playful child. I see I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
