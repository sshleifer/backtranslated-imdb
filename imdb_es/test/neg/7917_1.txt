I loved that All Dogs went to heaven so much that I went to see the sequel in the theater, and I do not remember having been more disappointed by a movie. The story stank worse than a sack of dung too old. Well then! How could Carface imagine being able to take revenge on an animal much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was? Besides representing Satan as a CAT?!?! How clich√© can you get? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback did not touch him with a 10-foot stick? The animation was absolutely miserable. All colors were erased, and I can not count how many times I was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid. It had to be the worst animation I've seen! I usually like animated movies, but this PUMP is not!
