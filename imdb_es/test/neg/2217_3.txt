Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitch! This trip in the center of the earth is a despicable technical possibility, however, current in 1976. This great "Casimir" of monsters is completely ridiculous! However, the film deserves a "remake", as it was "KING KONG" (the last), with a little more stage. The teacher has similarities with Professor Calculus and it is quite funny. David (the character) is quite inconsistent, but crosses (passes) the people below with a good message: "join and we will beat you!" In total we would say a movie made in the 40s. Now that I said everything (or almost) the evil of what I thought, we can say that if we have a tired brain or something has to do with the other, then the thing (matter) is even quite entertaining. Hugh! Such is my opinion! (translating French to English with "Reverso": sorry for possible errors!)
