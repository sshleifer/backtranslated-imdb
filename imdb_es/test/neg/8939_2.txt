The most obvious defect ... horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined by the bad dialogue, the continuity problems, the things that were never explained, the empty potholes, the subplots that did not lead anywhere and the stupidity. Not to mention the terrible, clicheada address of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could have saved this movie. So it did not matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette gave horrible performances. The thing is that they are better actors than this movie would make you believe. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has some good moments, like a big scene at the beginning when she removes the cuffs painfully, but offers a weak overall performance, according to her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, acting without conviction or emotion at all. But I'm not going to blame the actors, who have been good at other roles. The script is horrible, and bad direction does not help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
