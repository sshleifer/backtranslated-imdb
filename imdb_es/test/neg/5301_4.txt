I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel. First of all, Travolta is nothing like Chili Palmer of Get Shorty. He simply limited himself to half of this performance, as he has done in all his most recent films. Totally not smooth or has the presence of a mobster in it that makes you a little root throughout the film. It seems that Travolta got out of bed and decided it was good to act in this movie. The plot was not exciting or intelligent, there really is nothing outstanding to happen, the only thing that looked like entertainment was watching Christina Millian perform and The Rock was fun. But anyway, long story short, this movie was garbage and I had to force myself to pass it.
