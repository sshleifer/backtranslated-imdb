I give "Flashdance" a lower rating of 1 out of 10 because it is nothing more than a series of music videos with a short movie that surrounds the music videos, in order to synchronize them as feature films. Since when does that count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an 18-year-old aspiring dancer who, unknowingly, has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel mill. It is not a line of work that most older women find, much less than those 18 years old fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, at night she works like an exotic dancer, who never really takes off her clothes, on a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. However, looking at the well-choreographed and well-polished dance routines that the girls do every night at Mawby's, one would think they were working at the best casino in the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends up having a predictable romance with his boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice his age. After resisting Nick's advances, because dating the boss is not a good idea, he does not waste time going with him after his first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship at work, which does not make any sense, since Alex's co-workers are likely to be seen. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not duplicated for the large amount of dance In the sequences of the film, his character spends most of his time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an audition by invitation only at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she has been dreaming of, she throws her tantrums. She angry tells Nick that she is not auditioning because of her intervention, and then leaves her car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just a scene that makes you wonder what the creators were thinking when they did this. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alex finally gets his audition at the Conservatory. She performs a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that one might think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh, yeah, it's a dance routine in a movie marketed for the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can judge whether Beals can really act based on what I saw in "Flash Dance". This is because the character she is forced to perform is so poorly written that I do not think it is a fair trial of her acting skills. <br /> <br /> You have to give it to the creators of "Flashdance" though. This film is proof that a dazzling marketing film can cover the poorest by making movies. In this case, the soundtrack and the most sold and awarded music videos for the soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they could have created a plot and a story with characters that would matter to me. Instead, what we get are common characters who put into ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functional brain that can not be taken seriously. A truly forgettable "movie".
