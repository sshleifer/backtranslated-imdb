This "fragment of space" was a bit silly. I guess it was supposed to be an unexpected ending, but in my humble opinion it was just a big disappointment. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the earthly actors do a great job in this; Their performances do not do justice to such a silly ending however. The way this end could have come through any type of review by the producers surpasses me. The other comment here is not correct, the language cartoons only appeared during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! The producers and writers could have been a bit more creative with the ending to do justice to the rest of the episode.
