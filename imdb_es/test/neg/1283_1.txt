This film should fall in the annals of the feud as one of the worst of all time. I will not stop saying that it is the worst movie in history, only because I have not seen all the films that have been made yet. I can not make such high claims until then. The story is over, the acting is horrible, at best, the "special" effects are not more than a couple of pounds. Dry ice and a fan. Someone must have been related to someone to make this movie. Mr. Busey sent this by mail! The dog is well trained and cute, which makes it the only redeeming quality in this film that should never have been made. Two hours and $ 3 of my life I will never go back.
