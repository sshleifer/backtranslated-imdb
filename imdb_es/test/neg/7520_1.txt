This movie sucks. From beginning to end it was predictable. Absolutely there was no chemistry between Pearce and the girl from Mumba. The plot did not go anywhere, floating in oblivion. All this led the film to be very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just needs to leave.
