This mess begins with a real tank running over a car, interspersed with images of a toy tank. This is followed by a family who drives home after a birthday party without saying anything. The unexplained tank and the non-communicative family take, I swear, more than 10 minutes of film. Finally, the family sees a car after having been in an accident and decides to report it to the appropriate authorities, only to discover that all the citizens of the city hide in their homes and the police hide in the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the people of the city leave due to the presence of the family, we learn that both the writer and the editor are conspiring to replace the suspense with incomprehensible techniques of storytelling in the hope that the inability of the audience to say What is happening in some way brings concern about the audience. . and works! ... but not in the way they thought it would be. I was very uncomfortable with how bad this movie was, but I was not afraid at all. Dialogue is made up of things that make little sense. Not in a funny way by David Lynch, but in an entertaining way of conversation during the middle of a boring conversation. In the course of the next hour, we learn that the filmmakers are trying to bore us so that we are afraid to show tediously mundane scenes combined with the "what's going on?" typographies <br /> <br /> The plot involves something akin to kind-looking old people who put children in trance through the power of Satan and then take them to a party to play with toys, and even more. Sinister intention, and it depends on a group of white men (everyone is white in the movie) grabbing their weapons and saving the day, and a candy woman who cries with the drop of a hat. They search for kidnapped children searching in random places and shouting the names of the children. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because that person is scared by the mere thought of Satanism, paganism, wicca or even Catholicism because of a lifelong brainwashing diet from the Trinity transmission network. This represents Satanism as old people in Halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party, in front of an Ankh. Full with a priest who talks nonsense about the Satanists, while calling them "witches". The message that everything that is not Protestantism can be included in the same category for easy condemnation. <br /> <br /> About 30 minutes of images are wasted to show mediocre elderly actors babbling awkwardly gibberish Satanist pibra enough to make a teenager blush, almost always in English Olde and, sometimes, in Latin that may or may not be formed by words. <br /> <br /> Among the highlights is a boy who laughs at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family looking out the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to the elevator muzak. A priest who studies satanism for 4 minutes with drawings of demons so scary to scare the people of the Church. Random shots of dolls. Random shots of children. Painting instead of blood at every opportunity. Film school at the level of dream sequences. Enter unimportant characters who do not do anything before leaving. Sometimes, they act as if the Nothing they are doing is important. <br /> <br /> The address is, at best, neglected. An example of the direction includes a scene at the beginning where a man and a woman kiss and the man moves away to look her in the eyes with love and some dark red paint falls on his cheek. Looking up, they see that it is not blood, but droplets of a girl's snow. The snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and they would not have produced drops of the same texture as the paint, not to mention the fact that their snowcone was a bright orange-red color. The pirated script, no doubt, but worsened by misdirection. He then cuts off an alternative shot of the man, the woman and the girl, and shows that he is about four feet away from them, so that the snow would not have dripped on the woman, even if she had held her snow on the snow. the woman. face. Very good, editor! Of course, the performance is blah. The performance of the entire cast can be scaled and perfectly balanced between overacting and under-acting. <br /> <br /> The director's most offensive technique is not to motivate the actors and then go out to lunch like the eye that does not blink. of the camera fans, as the actors deceive themselves. <br /> <br /> AND, FINALLY, after all, we came to an end that would have been great if it had been handled by competent people and not by Jerry Falwell.
