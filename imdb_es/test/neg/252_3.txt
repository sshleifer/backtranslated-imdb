The reputation of "RVAM" preceded it. I heard it for the first time in one of those Medved style movie books, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever" or "The Golden Turkey Awards", or something like that. Every review of the movie basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make your eyes bleed when you saw it. Then, when the Exposed Film Society finally managed to show it, I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a truly stinky filmmaker can provide. <br /> <br /> However, "Robot" was not really that bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is definitely a "Z" movie through and through. Part of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case with the imports of K. Gordon Murray) is terribly corny, and the film itself seems to be structurally a kind of Frankenstein, since a large part of it seems to be a recording of a Previous "Aztec" "Mummy" movie, narrated with a voice over by the protagonist A dead draw: at any time the question "So what happened?" When asked more than twice in the dialog box, it is Seeing the images reassembled together with little regard for the coherence of the plot or the impulse In RVAM, "So, what happened?" or "What happened then?" It is pronounced at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /> <br /> Even without the structural problems, the plot and the dialogue do not translate well into a larger American audience, for example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the background story. Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who suddenly He became an evil criminal master "and began his search for the treasure that the Aztec mummies keep. No history, no explanation, just "suddenly became evil." Obviously, this was aimed at a fairly indiscriminate audience. <br /> <br /> The decisive factor, however, is the "Robot", the supposed "showcase" of this film. This robot is the worst special effect of a robot from the "Underwater Kingdom" or even "Santa against the Martians". Compared to this piece of trash, the Tin Man of the "Wizard of Oz" resembled the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the cast in T2. The Aztec mummy is well designed and executed; he is admittedly not dead, familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet different from the "Boris Karloff" bandage collection, which is very familiar to most American audiences. But who designed the Robot in this follow-up had no idea of ​​the concept ... or had no budget. They could have at least given him some knees, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> In addition, the titular battle runs terribly and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I have seen combat in the high school playgrounds that are more convincing). Then, basically, the movie simply stops. It seems like a scam considering the amount of time the film spends preparing for battle. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not horrible or incompetent like a Coleman does. Francis's movie or a Larry Buchanan movie was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of The Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's a bit boring and boring and silly. The actors are competent (in an educated way in the form of B movie) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular, seems to be having a great time reading, plotting and wrapping in his cape and the "Phantom of the Opera" suit. I often found myself supporting him, despite being the villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen a lot, much worse. File with "Samson Vs The Vampire Women", under "interesting Mexican juvenile curiosities".
