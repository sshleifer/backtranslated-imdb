I had to suffer this movie three times while I was an extra zombie in the director's new movie, After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the director was standing next to me and a hand that seemed clearly fake and cheesy came out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it anymore, I laughed right in front of the boy. The film has no direction and the only thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was too much for me. The worst was that I had to see it so many times. Also, do not expect the new movie to be better.
