Totally forgettable movie but an incredible soundtrack: I would give (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is excellent. I watched the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I became obsessed with getting the soundtrack and since then I had to replace it. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is the "other" lead guitarist with Steve Van Zandt in E Street Band. This guy can play! The voices are handled by Nils (he can not sing very well, too rough), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
