I had never really been interested in cannibalistic films and until a couple of months ago I had avoided this genre of film. <br /> <br /> I recently had to undergo knee surgery and discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands as I could not work, so I decided that after seeing almost all the horror movies that our local video store I had to offer, I would risk it. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I've never seen such a bad movie in all my years as a movie addict. This is just a bunch of s ** t stuck to a DVD disc and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I respect a lot of other horror fans who can disconnect their brains long enough to enjoy this shit, they are more cerebral than I ever will be and that is an achievement! 0/10 and that's generous.
