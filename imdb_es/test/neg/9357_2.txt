I was deeply disappointed in this movie. Twice I was tempted to leave because the segments of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film has elements that allude to all the marine things of life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang war). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher does great harm to the LDS Church by portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality and obedience as something out of focus and indifferent. /> <br /> My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is exactly the opposite of a movie to feel good. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's One's Army of God was fine. His city of Brigham was pretty good. This film, in terms of casting, acting and drama, was his best work. But in terms of being inspiring or encouraging, it was as horrible as it could be. In fact, this movie demoralized me so much that I regret having gone. I have lost interest in supporting Dutcher in an LDS-themed movie with the purchase of a ticket.
