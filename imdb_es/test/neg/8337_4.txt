Crazy and corny crazy about the lava that comes out of the wells of La Brea in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend disbelief ignoring this absurd premise, you will continue to laugh out loud at the inane dialogue, the arguments of the meaningless plot and the holes in the scientific plot of a reckless madness that parade through the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. This was the turn of Tommy Lee Jones. Although it makes a decent effort, the script is so pathetic that it even goes up in flames (oops, sorry for that). The majority of the support cast is also drowned out by hackneyed writing; Some of the actors simply phone in their roles. Anne Heche deserves special recognition from Hall of Shame for her clumsy interpretation of a scientist. She is as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he would at least have done a better job as an actor. <br /> <br /> Given that the holes in the scientific plot are too numerous to list here, instead, I would suggest that you project the film with friends, and have a game of "Find the scientific absurdities". The loser could be forced to listen to tapes of the movie's corny lines like "Everyone looks the same" over and over again. Here is a sample of the kind of nonsense that can wait: a scheme is designed, designed and designed to blow up a building, and the dynamite is established and detonated all in a space of about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the compulsory clich√©s of disaster films: divorced parents, scientists who are ignored by all, hateful policemen, street children, evil teenagers, greedy investors, etc. All are present and in abundance. The film also hits you in the head with an implacable bombardment of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for cheese fans and nonsense. All other spectators: be careful.
