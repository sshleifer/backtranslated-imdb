This short by Harold Lloyd was not really much; It is not one of your funniest efforts. Of course, I never see spoiled children as something hilarious. That's the biggest part of this story, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, taking care of their in-laws to two small children. One is a baby that cries constantly and the other is a terror of four years that does everything, but destroys the house. Letting the child wreak havoc over and over again was not entertaining for me. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple think that this great bully (Noah Young) is stealing his house. Half the time is the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some visual gags, which remind me of another Lloyd short, "Haunted Spooks." <br /> <br /> However, the good ending does not save the whole image, which you probably would not see again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to lose even 25 minutes with this again. It's just not so fun.
