That's what this movie is. My God special effects suck on this movie. It is difficult for something to aspire more than the plot of this film, but special effects manage to achieve it. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers traveling through a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a fool and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but he gets stuck with them when the helicopter breaks. Then, the five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is initiated by a guy that discharges tons of gas throughout the forest. All they show us are their boots, and they show scene after scene of the boots of this type that walk around throwing gasoline and causing fires. Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape from the fire, only to find that Bootman has managed to get ahead (while advancing at full speed through the forest on dirt bikes), discharge the gas throughout the area they traveled and start more fires. He does it several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and turns him on. I will not ruin the end, but the resistance of this guy will make you scream "WHAT BLOOD HELL?!?!" On the screen Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine that is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I will not even try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous and you will enjoy it more if you do not see it coming. Which you will not do, because you can not wait for what happens. This is due to the second major problem with this movie: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is it too much consistency to ask? Supossely Yes. I can not even count the number of broken members in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while their bikes collide). I think that each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. Then they limp until the scene ends, and then they forget that they are supposed to have broken limbs. There is a scene in which three of them who are supposed to have broken legs begin to dance. But then his injuries come back suddenly when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it is to see the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires is to align the dirt roads with the CGI fire. It can be clearly seen that the only CGI fire is along the roads, and all the trees that are more than two feet from the road remain untouched. And then they move away and show the whole forest engulfed in flames. It is difficult to describe in words how ridiculous it seems, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those bad guys, so good. There are times when he falls into the painful-bad category, but for the most part he stays above the line and is ridiculously inept. I can not wait to see the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in the pack of four with this one.
