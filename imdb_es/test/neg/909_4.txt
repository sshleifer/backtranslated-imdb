The story begins in the house of a girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and the father seemed to act fairly quiet and reserved among themselves. They proceeded to give their daughter their gift that belongs to both of them and I was very surprised by the expressions on the faces of the parents when they gave this gift to their son, it was almost like, 'I hope you like it'. There is a murder in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, gets involved in the case due to family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder interrupts her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighbor next door who lives in the same apartment as Julia and finally sleeps with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie, but it certainly is not to go crazy, unless you like a film location in Canada and the attractive Catherine Mary Stewart, native of Canada.
