Look for your camcorder, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door that throws boiling water at the raccoons; and you got a movie! Well, that's what these guys thought anyway. It was so bad that I can not even remember most, except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured 'Nam. Despite the really cheesy title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors and the writing of clich√©s, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I'm saving that slot for everything with Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Dam. Anyway, if you run out of options when it comes to finding new "horror" movies that you have not seen 1,000 times (as it was) and is debating this, I would still skip it. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities. This simulation of a serial killer was a weak and stabbing attempt at a uniform B movie. If you are very lucky, you could make the Wal-Mart $ 4.50 bin. But, I doubt it very much.
