Theft is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, look like they're going to get away with it. I have not even seen this movie, but not only do I know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another movie, or 2 movies for that matter, sucks (and if IMDb would allow much more profanity) than just one bull shit) I feel full of anger and I feel like I should throw myself out the window and finish everything. O.k that's little but the theft is worse. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Pontypool? It was this amazing little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio announcer gets to work, and then this zombie attack happens. We only see what's happening inside the radio station, and the only conjecture we have about what's happening outside is the occasional calls from his eye in the sky Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment of the movie in my life). mind) and the BBC Calling for an update on the situation. Of all the reviews I've read, and the conversation I had with my friend (who has seen this movie and Pontypool) this movie was exactly the same in the story, with little adjustments here and there. So throw the originality and creativity out the window. As for the Zombies, or the infected, whatever they want to call them. They are exactly the same, just because they got infected, it does not change the fact that they walk without thinking, and they have an endless calm for the flesh. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay, one to many, but let's go back to this fucking movie. The Zombies of what I have heard are very similar to those of 28 Days Later, another better movie, with its demented rage and even more insensitive blackouts of meat. This is where the Zombie movies define themselves, the story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as you do not take the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, the story can improve a zombie movie, as is the case with Pontypool, but the zombies have to be, in a way, original. 28 days later the mad Zombie started furious. Pontypool I can not even begin to explain to those guys without ruining the movie. The Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is rewrite the name because, come on, it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he went through all the different types of zombies, from the zombies with the face painted in Dawn of the Dead to the furious zombies in Diary of the Dead, and he did each one with his own unique style. <br /> <br /> Then, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time I explained why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie steals the original story scheme from Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people are expelled from school for doing this, however, in Hollywood it is allowed and apparently approved. This is not the only movie that takes the profile of another movie and just tries to tell it in a different way. The 90s are like the worst period for movies, I'm sure I had some gems, but what decade, and that's because all the films were exactly the same. My favorite, the crime movie with a turn so big that you'll never guess until the end. They force you to feed a suspect, it makes it seem impossible that nobody is more than him, so, bam, all this time was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he was not there and when he would do it. Mysteriously appearing out of nowhere, saying "hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! I DO NOT SEE WHAT COMES DID NOW! Well, I'm going to leave a cliché as my closing statement. This is a movie that you will surely want to miss.
