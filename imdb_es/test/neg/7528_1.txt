PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing plot and horrible performance. <br /> <br /> First, let's approach the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to contain a boiling and scandalous anger throughout the film, which is due to her overwhelming passion for becoming a prom queen. However, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become a dance queen in the first place. Before the nominations are read, she goes through the school with a constant disinterest in being there and, to begin with, she shows no interest in the place or in her students. Why do you care so much about being your prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an "acclaimed" performance but in reality she only spends all the time with an angry face, trampling, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you give a young actor / actress a script that only requires him / her to act in an angry way, you're not asking much. Nor are you allowing the character to develop very well. <br /> <br /> The character of Beth, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to his character at all. When being harassed by its director, she demolishes it (after several seconds) without feelings of disgust or commotion or anything equally traumatic. His lines read as if he were reading a triviality on the back of a cereal box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of their kidnapping sound more like they're planning a barbecue instead of deciding what they'll do with their director, sitting in his cellar. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry is killing several candidates for the prom queen, and no one notices or cares. (Yes, I understand, I understand, the whole city is worried about the prom, very realistic, at least you could include some funny scenes with the police, but that could be asking too much). For example, right after Cherry. Driving through school and knocking down a handful of students, Beth is interviewed by local media. The reporter mentions "the shooter" in a way that no one seems to know who killed these innocent students, but a second later he asks: "What do you think about the weapons in the hands of the minors?" Or something like that. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, after Cherry kills the winning queen of the prom and the graduation party is considered over, and the media appears again, Beth simply adds that "she understands that (Cherry) needs to be heard "and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a state of calm and without alterations. No one is surprised by the fact that they have just witnessed a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that students are constantly stationed in a yellow zone, and no one seems to care that there is a sudden increase in violence in the city, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the strange party at home (Maybe I stayed a bit offstage, but the last time I knew it, the high school parties did not include naked women dancing artistically in a puddle of water while men move around looking for marshmallows and everyone enjoys their "I'm so indie and mod" attitude, the horrible performance of Beth's mother with her mother acting out and her father just nodding in the face of everything the mother has to say (and not in a way entertaining), along with stupid scenes like the new black director who runs after Cherry while trying to shoot him with a gun Yes, very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give to this movie is that photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and clear with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the performance and the script are not.
