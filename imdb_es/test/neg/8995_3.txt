In most cases, a lethargic adventure, Naach is about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who considers herself as a kind of author, beyond the small commercial commitments that the people around her, including his actor beau (Abhishek Bachchan) build in their careers. . Good idea, only it turns out that she has the most terribly bad concepts about costumes and dance moves, things rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap potbillers in South India writhe with severe shame. <br /> <br /> The story follows a predictable pattern that induces yawns ... the dancer and Beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included) ... Beau succeeds, but she rejects his attempts to help her ... Beau throws the attitude and they walk with each other ... the dancer meets a more improbable director who wants her to "do what he wants" ... bags of incongruous effort even more incongruous popularity. .. Beau's attempts to arrive are rejected until a climax where he bursts about how he can not live without her ... D-uh final. <br /> <br /> I really did not expect this movie to be very good. Then, why did I look at it? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She is an actress with enough talent from IMO to reach great heights whenever she has the chance. Unfortunately, his role in the film looks much better on paper than in actual execution, ironic for a movie that is supposed to have to do with an intransigent character. To give her credit, she tries hard in the game, shining well in the few scenes that really ask her as an actress. I just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws some good punches, the last scene saved a bit by a slow twist that remembers him pleasantly to his father. <br /> <br /> It is only recommended if you can sit through huge piles of dog traps for the return of some grains of good times courtesy of the main actors.
