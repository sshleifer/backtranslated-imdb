"The evil that men do" begins with a truly repellent torture scene, followed, a little later, by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repugnant methods of torture that the sadistic and cruel villain likes to use. But despite the use of such effects strictly for impact, the filmmakers can not really hide the fact that this is just a boring and low-quality Bronson vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.
