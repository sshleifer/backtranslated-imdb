This movie angered me so much for its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account in IMDb to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "Much like love" and that's why I still wanted to see this movie despite his current rating of 4.2. It is highly overrated I trusted that an actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not accept to participate in a production of such low quality. It is very disappointing. The theme of the session at home was used much better in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that did not make sense here: the fist of everything, the owner of the house leaves his precious pet with someone who does not know anything about how to take care of him. Secondly, the rule is not to allow anyone to enter the house, but the caretaker of the house does not follow this simple rule. Is the door not locked? And so..
