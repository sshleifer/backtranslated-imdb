Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad television movies. Love them I get involved The jobs. I want to get involved I'm spending my time looking at the thing. I saw emmys last night on television. How in the infinite world was the television movie Empire Falls (excellent name) to receive a prize? I really had a wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But, how can ANYONE pretend that it was a script of OK (tv for the good of God)? OK address? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was totally disconcerting that Hollywood put this very bad movie with so many honors. Awards? For me it was a kind of wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really my thing. But wow --xptyngi
