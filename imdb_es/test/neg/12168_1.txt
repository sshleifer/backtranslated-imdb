Please, if you have not tried to sit through this crap and are considering watching this movie / miniseries, do yourself a favor and find something else to do. Brush your teeth, start learning to play the cello, win your dog: everything you choose will be a better time than looking at this garbage. This is not a bad movie from which you can get some giggles, it just sucks in every way. Simply boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for those animal lovers who feel that my previous comment is insensitive, if your dog could talk, he would beg for a beating instead of suffering through watching this disaster.
