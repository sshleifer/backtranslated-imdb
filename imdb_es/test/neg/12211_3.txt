This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was fully prepared to have a good time. At least I thought I would be able to handle it. But I was wrong. First, the strange loop? It was like watching "The funniest home videos in the United States". The damned parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latin family? I need to talk to the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated it and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It is so gloriously bad and full of evil that it is a movie of its own. What the fuck dancing. Horrible and beautiful at the same time.
