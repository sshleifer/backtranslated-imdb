I never really understood the controversy and exaggeration that this movie caused. Especially in French and in neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am located, for example), "Baise-Moi" was announced as the most impacting and stimulating social drama I have ever experienced. Yeah sure! It may be a bit shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone shooting in the ass?), But the weak and meaningless plot surely did not make me think much. "Baise-Moi" is another of those "faults of everything that goes wrong in society," and in general they are not very convincing. About 99% of people work perfectly well in this society, why would you blame this same society for the vile and desperate acts of two deranged ninf-girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are presented separately and in flashes. Nadine has just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and the two are in an abandoned train station, late at night. They decide to travel together through France, leaving behind a trail of sex and blood where they made a stop. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this movie is very boring to sit on. As the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they meet (and kill?) Are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, that's fine with me, but please, do not pretend it's an artistic film. If you leave aside the insult and the camera work, all you have to see is (not so) the awakening of pornography. Good soundtrack, however!
