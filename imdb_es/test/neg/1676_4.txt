A child puppeteer, for a children's show with public access, goes through the back when he discovers that the children he receives in a hospital were victims of horrible abuses. This movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you've ever met. It is not an exploitation film as much as an after school special about the dangers of child abuse. Seemingly harmless, Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems that the police are neutralized by the lack of evidence to condemn the odious parents of their terrible abuses against their children. Children have no emotions and are like zombies (.. due to the amount of abuse inflicted on them), parents are strong, inconceivably harsh, despicable and belligerent. Mothers, in particular, are so obscene that you will encourage their execution. They are essentially miserable people who bring their frustrations to children. Our detectives are very tired, frustrated with the whole judicial process, since the police procedure often can not prosecute those who subject their children to submission. While the crimes themselves are atrocious, the film does not explicitly explain the creepy activity on the screen. I would say that the reason for seeing this is because of Tom Basham's performance as the unbalanced man-child that falls into psychosis. There is a rather strange sequence on the dinner table between Mr. Rabbey of Basham and his guardian shortly after murdering the parents responsible for the death of his son, as to how he lives in a fantasy and how he had just Making an indelible mark (. (notice the changes in behavior, quite impressive work, going from innocent to creepy.) Peter Renaday is Lieutenant Hayes, the detective in charge of homicide cases, expressing in his face the tension John Ashton acted early as Detective Matthews, always provoking Hayes's anger because of his inability to follow instructions, not to mention the opinion he has about parents who abuse their children.An uncomfortable blues score that seems improper for a film like this, controversial conclusion that even children can only tolerate so much, a little too slow for my taste, but I feel that Basham has Ne effective use of the eyes before dealing with the business, waiting patiently while preparing to attack.
