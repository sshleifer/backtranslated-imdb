It's hard to imagine someone who makes a Tom Cruise movie look good; Really hard, but this makes it look good. Very well. Actually, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud celebrating the Day of Very Good Acting with a courageous performance. <br /> <br /> The performance of the whole team fought to overcome the laughable and failed. The guilt was, in part, to be fair, that the plot resembled both the original HG Wells and the dead animals killed in the film with their living predecessors: both were bloody and violated the remains of more attractive predecessors. But to describe a plot like this to be a bit sacred is to say "My kitchen utensil has a lot of holes", unless, that is, the holes are your bag; In this case, this movie will be recommended to you. <br /> <br /> The flaw in the other part was that they were unmotivated, working DVD actors, who knew very well, it is assumed, that this was their display that ended up on the $ 5 DVD shelf And overrated in that. <br /> <br /> Then, should you see it? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and you deserve punishment.
