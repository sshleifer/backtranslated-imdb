Tense and lacking in humor (especially in light of his dubious psychology), but with good rhythm and comfortably lurid, this elegant body count film highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman periodically possessed by Jack the Ripper, thus allowing some unpleasant effects of blood in the middle of the Edwardian property. For Hammer, everything is quite standard, but it is handled with a great deal of visual effort, even if the central relationship, between the psychoanalyst Porter and Rees, drives the narrative without being satisfactorily explained.
