Having seen Acacia, I find that I agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horror, and had high expectations for this movie. Man, I was disappointed. Seeing this, I kept thinking "surely they will do it to catch me off guard later", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, little by little I realized that the movie really is so bad. It's the cheapest money in the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story may not be so bad, but the way it was filmed seems the most ridiculous argument of all. The tree as a "fear" device could be fine if it is used intelligently, but all the filmmaker does is give us different shots of ... yes, a tree, again and again. He seems to expect the tree to do all the work for him in terms of tension and accumulation, but he feels like what he is: shots of a tree. For the love of God! <br /> <br /> Slow accumulations can be very effective, and a movie that presents the viewer with only a few glimpses of what is wrong can produce a good alarm, but not Acacia. Sure, we can see a child on a tricycle disappearing in a corner and, once again, significant shots of the tree from above, below or to the side, but these scenes are simply not scary. They feel silly, especially because you realize that the director wants them to be scared. They just are not. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the "descent into madness" of a character is laughable. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible edition. It is hard to see why the scenes were cut together the way they are, but it is bad, and it kills any spark of interrest that it has had. It also makes me feel paternalistic, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with that, but I can not believe they think I would fall for those cheap tactics. <br /> <br /> There are many great Asian ghosts. Movies, and many bad, but this is by far the worst I've seen. They should have been reviewing the list of 'what to put in the ghost movies', and mark them all, but in the end they forgot to add the real movie.
