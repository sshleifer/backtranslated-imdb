Hollywood has taken out other trash that has been overrated and disappointing for the first time. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, idiotic, idiotic, ideal, laughable and absolutely atrocious (no pun). The smaller spoilers are still ... <br /> <br /> This movie has huge logical holes, more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie, or any other movie that exemplifies the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It is an ingenious Hollywood production designed to capitalize on the mania of Hannibal Lector, directed by Ridley Scott, the hacker director "very somber, who takes himself very seriously", and produced by an Italian hacker producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "it does not matter if the movie is s ** t, the money is good". <br /> <br /> I can not forget the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame man and the pretentious book of a good novelist turned hacker and author Thomas Harris. David and Steven, well-known and immensely talented screenwriters, squandered their effort in a bad script in exchange for large paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many absurd scenes to list that are ridiculous in clumsy execution and poor logic, for example. Starling / Pazzi cell phone in the middle of the Lecter search that makes Inspector Pazzi the victim. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues of Tony Hopkins with a smile and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can not act with a straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "chewing landscapes" along with Hammy acting as Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on taking revenge on Lecter. <br /> <br /> The bloody effect is good, but it only serves to repel rather than provide suspense that is noticeably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor, the silence of the lambs, is more credible with tension and suspense. The suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological suspense and suspense, not to mention that it is written in a magnificent and tense way. The sequence of the "brain dinner" is so ridiculously false that it limits self-parody. <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit shameless and idiotic: we're supposed to believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot. Establishing your shining eye looking at you? Ooh, fear ... <br /> <br />
