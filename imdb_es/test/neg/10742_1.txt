--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> This was The worst of the series, is the horror disguised as political satire and is as subtle as a hammer, not very scary or very insightful. Did Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage? <br /> <br /> I'm really fed up with Hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike that movie that approached in a subtly moving way the problems of the soldiers who returned from Vietnam by having the main character come back as a bloodthirsty zombie and slowly based on this theme: a real horror movie that was also a good social commentary, since he did not become dangerous, exploiter and preacher. <br /> <br /> I guess Joe Dante thought that this was trying to make a horror movie to scare Republicans, conservatives and libertarians. The last thing on that list found that this movie was totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitative at the same time and I do not mean the good kind of exploitation, which is often found in "drive-in" movies, I mean exploitative most sickly and vile way: use the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political declaration disguised as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This film assumes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a conservative president if they came back to life as zombies, which is a faulty premise, because as I remember mostly and following the George Romero's rules; The zombies are beings without sense, creatures that eat meat, operate by pure impulse and, although the zombie Andy, in DeathDream could speak, could not really hold a conversation and his addiction to human blood impelled him. Okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not by intellect and obviously they're dead, so why would the dead be allowed to vote in the first place? My interpretation of this film is that the only war that a liberal democrat could win is to have people without sense, dead people who vote for him, I guess they meant that people who vote for presidents like George Bush are mindless zombies, while that the true ones without mind The zombies, are in fact those that make the decisions intellectually it sounds. Yeah, whatever. Dawn of the Dead approached this idea much better, but uses the idea of ​​mindless consumerism. This movie is not Dawn of the dead by stretching the imagination. <br /> <br /> The film tackles the issue while the soldiers are alive and most of them voted for a president like Bush, but after his death. they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies, who are usually considered brain dead creatures and, ridiculously, destroy them after voting. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a zombie movie, Mr. Dante and invoke the name of George Romero in it, it is better that you have senseless zombies that tear people apart and eat their intestines, not zombies who vote I also like how zombies simply become "evil" to the conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this piece of junk badly done, with preaching and watch DeathDream instead. <Br /> <br /> The worst of Master of Horror Series is indisputable.
