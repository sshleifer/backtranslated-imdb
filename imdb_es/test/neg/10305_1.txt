The first season was excellent: a good combination of work and brother and friends at home. Actually, it was a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now it reappears and the brother and the two hot girls are gone, and everything revolves around the airline. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill, too exaggerated, where before it was perfect. <br /> <br /> That and no more Sarah Mason, one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some executives get their hands on a program. You can almost see the meeting "the old man is fun, we are going to concentrate on him, we surpass him and we do everything about the airline ... it will be a crazy version of the office!" Anyway, there are no hot girls, no watch.
