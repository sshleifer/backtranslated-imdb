I wanted to love this movie so much ... I really did it. But it was a horrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and the story captivated me. In fact, it's still one of my favorite books of all time. Of course, the book had much more depth than this film, plot and emotional resonance. HE DID YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. He painted a complete picture of Phoebe, unlike the poor characterization of the girl in the film. <br /> <br /> Although beautiful and with some promise in her burgeoning career, Jordana Brewster was as flat as hollow. This performance as was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. What a clumsy couple. Wolf should have been more of a dark and melancholic character, and more physically attractive, as he was in the book. What's more, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, however, deserves the highest praise for his performance. He took an incredibly mediocre script and gave life to his character, a true spirit. She is simply beautiful and her careful manners make her very believable as a hippie. It is a pity that his talent has been wasted in this forgettable film. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-film category, this is a dreadful translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But do not start with that ... <br /> <br /> In general I'm not that hard with my criticism, but I was very disappointed here because I was really interested in the story and wanted to see it told. Right. It was not delivered ... <br /> <br />
