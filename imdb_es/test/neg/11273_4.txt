A little too Mediterranean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, lovely to see in all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with blue skies and blue water. I just was not convinced that such an egomaniac woman inclined to anything other than her building could attract so many beautiful and vulnerable women. Only in the Mediterranean I suppose. Certainly in no world with which I am familiar. The macho men were really unpleasant, and I found it hard to believe that the female characters could have anything to do with them for so long. The script, the cinematography, the direction, etc. they were created to offer a Class B movie, and the central effort was to show scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. Aesthetically it was nice for a while, but it could not sustain a very mediocre movie.
