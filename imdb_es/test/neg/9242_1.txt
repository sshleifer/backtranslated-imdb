I saw this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student, nor am I an artistic intellect that tries to look for a deeper meaning in everything I do not understand. However, if I had to do that with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He's drugged and I can imagine him now ... he stumbled one night and sat with his friends laughing and saying things like, hey ... would not it be funny if the nuns could really fly? How and if one simply fell off a plane and fell free for a while, bounced off the ground and got up and walked away? * laughter * or if the buckwheat gave the pope a bath? My God, I'm laughing just thinking about it! Kind! We have to make a movie about it! And then he says to his friend while he laughs ... Oh, and would not it be funny if people loved him and called me a genius for that? So for me, this is what happens when a guy drinks too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. Should I have been doing LSD to understand what this guy was thinking so that I could also laugh? Because I have to tell you that I was not laughing. I was yawning and checking the time. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone who is doing everything possible to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director until I came to read the reviews, which I did because I was angry about losing the last 2 hours, or for how long it was (I felt like the 12 hours of my life) and I can never get it back , anyway ... I read that this guy is a heroin addict and that he wanted to die for art. What the hell is that? So my point is something proven. This guy is not all there is, he's a drug addict and his movie is evidence of that ... So, please, stop trying to find a deeper meaning. If you really want to understand everything in this movie, go take some LSD and sit back and relax, then it might make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the time I saw the Last Days of Gus Van Sant. Another movie that drove me crazy to see. I can not help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie, if the same people reviewed it and reviewed it. It seems that, if the director of the film is totally out of the picture, or if it is a French film with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, you will get excellent reviews, without a doubt, everything else is boring and has already been fact. BLAH, bring the bored please!
