"A scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads.The scientist decides to use his serum in a concert pianist to extort money for the cure, as well as to take the man's daughter for a wife", according to the Synopsis of the sleeve of the DVD. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in Bela Lugosi's low budget mode. <br /> <br /> Mr. Naish's serum causes a real disorder, the "acromegaly," which American Heritage defines as "A chronic disease of adults marked by enlarged bones of the extremities, face and the jaw that is caused by the hyperactivity of the pituitary gland. " Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the afflicted man with a certain dignity. The beautiful blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter desired by the mad scientist Naish; In the early scenes, Mrs. McKay and Naish expressed themselves in a hilarious way. <br /> <br /> Look out for Tala Birell (as Maxine) in a surprisingly good support performance; She plays the assistant of Naish, something similar to Garbo, and of long suffering. Mrs. Birell definitely steals the movie; and, you have to question Dr. Markoff's sanity by setting it aside. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and a crazed gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun. The monster's makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
