To begin with, I once met the director when he went to the recreations of the Second World War with a vintage film camera and made videos of the events that looked VERY GOOD. I really wish he had kept that. Because as much as I applaud what he achieved with a clearly "almost nothing" budget, when I pulled out the DVD, I wondered why I sat for almost two hours with nothing. There's no real plot to talk about, you really do not care what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some Germans), and the end is another comment about "art film" about the uselessness of the war. I could have told someone how it would end once I finished the first ten minutes. I knew that the Germans would have some volunteers heroically to fight to the death, I knew that most of the Quartmaster IGs would be killed, it was too obvious! And while I'm on the subject, I was surprised to see that much of the Axis side is fine, but the GI side did it comically. All the development of the character was clearly for the roles that do not speak English. The GI simply became hard in this movie. And I can not help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the United States Army works? The phrases, the terminology, the actions, were clearly written by someone without any knowledge of the US military. If I had known who directed this film, I would have sworn it was directed and written by a German ...
