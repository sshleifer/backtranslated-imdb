Plankton, or Creatures of the Abyss, as I'm sure, is most commonly known as & filmed under the title Creatures of the Abyss appears on a moving image and in the same typeface as the other credits, it starts with five 20 something children, Mike (Clay Rogers), his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), his sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decide to fit into a small rubber boat and leave. to the sea, do not ask because I do not know. Oh, and the complete idiot, Bobby left gas behind and never thought to tell anyone, so it's no wonder they end up stranded in the sea with no gas for the engine and to make things worse, they get caught in a thunder storm . Discover a dead body floating in the water. Soon after their luck seems to change when they meet a yacht and its potential safety, in an instant, all board the yacht and begin to explore. First, they find a scientific laboratory with several specimens of fish and computer equipment, then, below, find completely furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who looks angry and can not talk. They eat fish from the fridge, which causes Dorothy to vomit green vomits, beetles and slugs. They learn that these fish live from millennia of fossil years and have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped into the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite and are generally unpleasant. I can not really bother to continue with this scheme of the plot, so I will not do it, this is what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym of Al Passeri (I would hide under a different name if I made such a bad movie) and I think Plankton is just one of the worst movies in history, there are so many bad things in this movie that it's hard to know where to start. First, Richard Baumann's script is total shit, it does not make any sense and it's so slow and boring that it was torture for me to sit down. Why would five people simply set sail to the middle of the ocean in a rubber boat barely big enough to fit all? What were you planning to do exactly? Why do we often get point-of-view shots of these fish creatures, but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters, since they are never shown on the screen even though they are right next to a character? Boat since there is no water to swim? The actions and reactions of people to things are wrong, they are constantly divided, they make strange decisions that simply do not make any sense in the situation they are in and part of the dialogue is as horrible as anything else that they have heard. I could continue all day on all the holes in the plot and the ridiculous events, but I will run out of space if I do. The fish creatures themselves look awful, a mix of rubbish rubber puppets and some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes in which they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad overlays. I've heard many comments that say Plankton is bloody, do not make me laugh! Forget it, there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton, there are a couple of slug scenes when Bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with Julie, but it is quite brief and does not kill her, it just drips slime into it, grows a Pair of tentacles and a fish head comes out of its mouth. Later, Julie's vagina starts to drip a little dark slime, but that's it, we never get to really see what happens to her or what the slime is. Dorothy has a fish creature coming out of her back, off the screen, and controlling it, but once again we never see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. Easily, the crudest scene is when Dorothy vomits that green thing with what appear to be beetles and slugs in it. That's it, only one person dies on the screen and, for the most part, the plankton is quite docile and as exciting as seeing the paint dry and I almost fall asleep, it's very boring. I can not see how anyone can like this total shit, I just can not. The acting is horrible, the dubbing is horrible, the characters are horrible and I hated them all. Technically, plankton is also predictably bullshit, with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000, all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous and boring with a lab and some cabins, the special effects are the bottom of the things in the barrel, including the most fake explosion canister, the cinematography is tasteless, the music sucks, there is no atmosphere or tension and in general Plankton, as its name, is as low in the food chain as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's horrible in all aspects of its 86-minute duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs unless you are a masochist or an insomniac.
