That in the world! This piece of game cinema would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his interpretation of "Stu" fell short. The assemblies were unbearable and too many. The cast of support, where are you? Whoever did the casting must be partially guilty. The cinematography was useless. A game story with a feeling after school. Stories of this kind should be left for the Oliver Stone of the world. It would still stink, but at least it would be fun to see it. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race began. Mario Andretti in 1982 Indy 500 came to mind.
