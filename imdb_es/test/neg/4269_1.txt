This horrible action? The science fiction movie is crap. I just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've seen. The story does not make any sense, there are many flaws in the script, the characters are badly developed, the unknown cast is horrible, the main actor seems to be too old for his role. They induced me to buy this VHS, which has a great cover, and see this crap because of the illogical rating of IMDb users and some "ten star" reviews. I just consulted the authors, and each of them has only a brief review (of "L.I.N.X.") published in IMDb, and nothing else. Why are you promoting such garbage? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
