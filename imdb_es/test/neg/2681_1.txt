Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can see the same movie, one of them loves her and the other hates her. As regards 'Halloween: the Curse of Michael Myers', I fall into the last category. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, John Carpenter, in 1978, made one of the best frightful films of that decade, which despite its shortcomings, still remains well into the 21st century. He reused many of the old horror movie devices, but he used them in original and effective ways. I had no pretense that it was nothing more than a movie about a babysitter who escaped child molesters on Halloween night. And yet, there were "ideas" in the movie, but they were subtly introduced and did not get stuck in his skull. He juxtaposes the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was happening in the story and he did it with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The 'filmmakers' of this 'movie' probably would not even understand that previous paragraph. That's why they load us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are from the lowest strata imaginable. This is the kind of movie that is so boring and nauseating that it makes you want to go back to the womb and die. It is also truly sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence lose his acting skills with this puddle of saliva from a movie. He seems exhausted from all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. Maybe that's what killed him.
