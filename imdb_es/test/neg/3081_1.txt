From what I remember seeing from this movie, it was not good. I always say that if a movie is good and you can keep your attention during the most difficult times (for example, a War of Tylenol Cold & Sinus), it is a movie that has done its job. The fact that I was asleep for most of this movie only proves the fact that he could not keep my attention and, therefore, did not complete his work. Why was I a victim of Tylenol Cold & Sinus, when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> To begin with, Committed did not make any sense. The performance was bad and the general story left more doors open that simply could not be closed. I'm thinking about the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. That did not make any sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking a perfect lesbian couple. I guess this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as Graham, but to me it was just a filling. I suspect that the director of this movie was sleeping with Affleck. His performance in this movie was atrocious. I mean, I've never seen him do a "good" performance, but this was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment during the battle and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what was John Stewart doing in this movie? That was another moment in which my eyes opened only for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And, frankly, it's Heather Graham: we could not worry about her after a while. She is not interesting, she is bland, bored and basically stops acting after a while. While they desperately start throwing extravagant characters in the mix to revive the movie, it just does not work and instead of calling it a day, they start adding more characters to the mix, so it's now weird, tedious, boring and, really , very long The slow acting style of Luke Wilson slows down a film that is already dragging, why exactly did these two get married? Committed is a really terrible movie, the kind of "modern comedy" that leaves you depressed and bored. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
