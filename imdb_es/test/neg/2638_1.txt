This movie was so weak that I could not even create good clich√©s to cheat. I love horror movies and I'll see practically anything, but if I had to repeat one more time, I would have skipped this one completely. You may think I'm overreacting, but I challenge anyone to find something that is remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of junk. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not funny, it's not worth it.
