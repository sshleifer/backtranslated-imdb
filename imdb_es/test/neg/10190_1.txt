I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that tried to get the audience (me) to make the decision to accept Christ in my life or risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was a big false trail! The acting in it was quite pathetic. In fact, it seemed that some people from an evangelical church came together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church talking with other church members. It was not a real-life dialogue. I wish I had read some reviews before watching this movie so I would not have wasted my money on it. If, on the other hand, you like the whole church scene, and you want to see a demonstration of how to take your views (no matter how limiting) to other people, then, of course, go and see it.
