First of all, I really can not understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. It's the worst I've seen in my life. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think that says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I have to give my applause to the creators of the opening credits, that team seems to have a very good future. That's why I recommend the big studios ONLY to see the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if you look out of this movie, it almost seems like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this ... this "thing".
