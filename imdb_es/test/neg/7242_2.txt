The Salena incident takes place in Arizona, where six prisoners on death row are being transferred from the state prison for reasons never explained, while driving along the heavily armed prison bus is flattened and the driver is forced to leave road. Then two blond birds appear and, after seducing the incompetent, the prison guards manage to get the best out of them, the six prisoners are freed, but in a shootout, their escape cart is damaged leaving them stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to go to the nearest town, Salena, several kilometers away, and take the police hostage. Once they arrive at Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted and that no other person is in sight. They soon discover that the entire city has been killed by aliens who eat meat and are firmly placed on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the USA. UU On DVD and apparently have the Terror Town job title this low budget sci-fi horror movie was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redemption feature. The Salena incident is the kind of movie that gives movies a bad name. . The film could be roughly divided into two parts, the first forty or fifty minutes focus on the prisoners in a sense of suspense, the guards and the escape, although it is quite poorly written and staged. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so bad that it is involuntarily funny, since the two birds in shape chat with the prison guards who are not so fit. Really funny things, unfortunately the Salena incident is supposed to be a science fiction horror movie, not a comedy. Then, once the contras escaped and their prison hostages reach Salena, they enter the sci-fi terror mode when the aliens appear and start killing our clichés, which is good because they are annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks, because it's badly written, thought and made. I really can not bother explaining why, but believe me. The Salena incident is horrible on all levels. <br /> <br /> Besides being a bad, boring and stupid movie, the Salena incident is also badly done. The action scenes are horrible, the aliens look terrible and never show up on the screen at the same time as the human characters and, as such, it is sometimes hard to tell what is happening. The special effects are also bad, the aliens look unpleasant and CGI computer effects are also absolutely terrible. The editing is poor, the cinematography is bad, the sets are cheap and everything is really a monstrosity. There is some blood, there are some bullet wounds, someone is torn in half and a hand is cut off. <br /> <br /> Obviously it went off with a low budget The Salena incident has low production values ​​and seems cheap from the beginning to the end. Filmed in Superior in Arizona. The acting is terrible on the part of nobody of which I have heard speak, although the actress who interprets to the doctor is quite attractive. <br /> <br /> The Salena incident is a horror and science fiction movie that is terrible in just about every way, it's not worth 90 minutes of yours, mine or anyone else's.
