I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is quilted to hell and returns with archival images of various insects and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original "big box" form of VHS and was very excited. I love finding old movies on VHS because the cover is fantastic. Usually, though, it turns out that the movie itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it started well, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods. The sounds of the heartbeat used are a great effect that makes you feel tense as you look. This movie is basically a big cliché, and when the "Campfire Stories" section appears, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half the execution time in the killer's story. Actually I thought that this was a very original idea. However, the background story ends abruptly and shows us some archive images of a burning forest (the lack of budget really starts to show now). After this, they return us to the dumb teenagers who are picked up in the forest. The murderer himself is not shown until the end, which is a shame because he is actually an effective-looking killer. Something like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As for Gore, there is not much, although there is a good whitening time at the end. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than the Slasher finalists, it really is a big disaster.
