Check the box "contains spoiler", in case it says something that is a spoiler and I do not realize that I have said it until I reread it after having published it. So it's just in case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, going back to review this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on skymovies this afternoon, and from the description that Sky gives you (these people should be on acid) it sounded pretty good, but when I had about 30 minutes, I was horrified. This film, in my opinion, has the worst writing of scripts and actors / actresses of all time. The young girl who falls in love with the child of L.A after about 3 hours, is a really stupid and lame character, who has an annoying and plaintive voice, and a long hair. -.-. Then there is his lover, who is an idiot, and he is also very tearful. Actually, they may fit together. Then there is the child's mother, who is with him on vacation, and surprise, surprise. She is a doctor and, oh my God, wait, there are even more unsuspected surprises! A virus suddenly appears on the island and she knows everything about viruses! = O. SHOR HORROR! Yeah sure. Hahaha Then there is this crazy religious madman, who keeps talking about "erbs" or something like that, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to want it, but in reality it is stubborn, arrogant, with steroids (you really need to see this movie only because of the scene in which it comes out of the sea after swimming, its head is very small and its body is MASSIVE It is hilarious) jester who has drunk too much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after all these weird characters, including a drugged-looking taxi driver, the religious boy finally gives in to the doctor. , and she takes a blood sample, and they go to work to find the cure from that, because for some reason he has been saved dramatically, all the way to "erbs and God". And oh my god YES, THERE IS ANOTHER SURPRISE! NEVER guess what! Just in time, with 11 minutes for everyone on the island to fall dead, including his son and his girl, she finds the cure, and injects everyone, and everything is solved! What a pathetic movie. I mean, I knew it sounded like an obvious ending from the first time I started watching it, but actually I thought it would be good and it would have some secondary plot twists somewhere, but no, no, it was just boring and dry. <Br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. You will end up like me: stunned for 3 hours and then demand the hour and a half that you spent in your life observing it.
