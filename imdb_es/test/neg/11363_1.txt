This has to be the worst movie I've seen this year ... and I see a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are simply thrown at you without action, without beginning or ending of any scene ... they are just random idiots with makeup screaming in some plane ... The "special effects" (Spielberg would laugh her ass out) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are nice, though ... I have to can not stand to see it until the end. The scene in which the great scientist that Bennett supported for the life of the engine was too much for me ... I'm sorry for my bad English ... I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I had to register just to make a comment about this movie because I can not believe that this is a movie released in 2007.
