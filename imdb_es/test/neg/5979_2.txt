Approximately 5 minutes into the movie, they get you into this brutally warm cat-and-mouse romance between the two main characters. The biggest problem is the characters and how incredibly incredible they are. This is how 50-year-old producers and Hollywood screenwriters out of touch think that the life of a fool is as if they had given the Friends group a little pot. Soda, boring, annoying and completely unreal. I despise this movie.
