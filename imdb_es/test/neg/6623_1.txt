These films shook my will to live why this abomination is not the list of the last 100 I do not know. <br /> <br /> My life was saved by the healing power of Danny Trejo. <br /> <br /> The worst movie of all, I dare to see it. It's like a 90-minute ad, but much worse. I prefer to see the blue screen is really that bad
