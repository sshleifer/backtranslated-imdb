I went with some friends and one of my friends, thinking it would be a good way to start spring break, but the movie was horrible. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. More like material R Much sexual dialogue, cursing and referring to parts of boys and girls (below the waist). It's not worth the time or the money. I urge you not to leave, or to rent it when you leave. If you end up going, do not bring smaller children. It's not the kind of movie to watch with the family! If you are curious about the content, check the content advisory section on the Superhero Movie page in IMDb. Most of the content that should be fun was extremely crude. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
