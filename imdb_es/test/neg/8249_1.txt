Sappy <br /> <br /> I liked how they went to the "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books to each other to impress the ugliest girl in the world. <br /> <br /> Probably the doorman of my school is a genius too, but he is waiting to get that big construction job. <br /> <br /> Just because you keep your nose on the tooth is not a reason to try to cut a steak with it. "You like apples?" <br /> <br /> the boy agrees or something like that. <br /> <br /> "Well, how did you like the DEM APPLES?" Wow that's cool. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver would give your number to anyone. Robin Williams can not paint and keeps good books on the top shelf. And there is a teacher who always wears a priest's handkerchief without any reason.
