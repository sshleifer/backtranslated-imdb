I'm sorry to rain in everyone's parade. Just a little history about me: I like it and I know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. It's true that I'm a rookie when it comes to South Korean cinema but, if it's the best of the best, I'm sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign films and that I do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb American". . . Well, not perfectly. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the great praise that is given to this piece of nothing. This is a disgusting * and * ridiculous movie. Hammy acting: everything is wrong and exaggerated, like begging for the attention of the uneducated spectator. Horrible camera work, with an insistence on nonsense close-ups derived from the aesthetics of MTV. <br /> <br /> The plot is more full of holes than a giant piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a suspense movie to be 100% realistic and, for the sake of entertainment, I would love to close my eyes to small details. But, excuse me, what is going on here that * can * support even a summary examination? This story of an incredibly complex and contrite act of vengeance is worse than the worst story of a tabloid that can be read in a row at the supermarket. (I do not want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that is the word, so it will not go into details of the plot). The fight scenes are violent, incredible, absolutely stupid (the main "hero" takes dozens and dozens of opponents at the same time, after he ONLY trained while in prison, he hit a wall!) The truly "outstanding" characteristics of this film is two: the inquisitive and incestuous sex (brother in sister and father in daughter, well, we have evolved from Oedipus, right?) and graphic violence. The body parts cut (hands, teeth, tongues) together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this film to be made?) They have no aesthetic function / motivation whatsoever. <br /> <br /> A party for the S & M bowed, no doubt, but, even for those, a party without merit or subtlety. Gosh, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar subject was not SO bad. <br /> <br /> The invariably good press this pretentious, exaggerated and extensive piece of free blood from the Korean coasts gets I wonder what is going on. I do not consider myself the best example of taste and, often, I am willing to accept that a film I did not enjoy could be better than I could perceive. However, I do not have any scruples when calling this as I see it: bad, bad, bad. There are no redeeming qualities. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
