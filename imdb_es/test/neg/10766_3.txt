As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and has seen most of the films based on them, I must say that the 1980 version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was written better and adhered more to the spirit of the story than to it, which seemed to do everything possible to get people shot. This new adaptation is less cheerful, but it does not have as much depth. While there is good performance, the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes, however.
