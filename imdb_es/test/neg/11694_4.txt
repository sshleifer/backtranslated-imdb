Because of the acclamation I received, I expected more of a Korean horror if it were to be seen in the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters, as other reviews have said. This movie is not in the same caliber, except in the budget spent on special effects. Think of Amytiville the horror. With a tree and a scattered dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you are going to have a movie with a limited dialogue, the plot line and the characters have to take the film. This film could have been told quite well in a short film concept of 30 minutes, 2 hours with a lot of trees and horror scenes that not only scare you, but also detract from you in a kind of "What ..." It makes a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> Those people who claim that this movie gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror movies put it on.
