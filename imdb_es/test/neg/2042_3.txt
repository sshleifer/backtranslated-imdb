I just can not understand it, the monsters on the planet are talking about this as a must see, they even dare to call it a (s) exploitation because the possessed girl seduces the priests and masturbates all the time. Do not let me laugh I saw the movie, seducing it is only at the end of the movie and I do not call it seducing, it's just a bad language that is speaking. And the masturbationcene is also a great laugh, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with his clothes on you perverted. It's not bloody or bloody at all, everyone is throwing up at Beyond The Door, well, let me tell you it's better for me than this movie. Only the last 5 minutes the possessed one vomits and has strange eyes. If I had known that this is so bad, then I would never have caught a copy. If you really do not want to see an exploitation about the exorcism, look at Angel Above, The Devil Below or other cheesy. A waist of time this is.
