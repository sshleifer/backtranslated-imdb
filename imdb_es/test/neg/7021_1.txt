I truly love Lucy too ... funny genius yes ... MAME ... NEVER ... was as ridiculous as Mame ... as was the film adaptation of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya sisterhood. Both lost the point completely. Roslind Russell was, is and always will be the first and only Mame. Maybe as a young star, Ball could have achieved a role like this, where his inherent beauty and youth could have carried it out ... but this seemed like a desperate attempt by an aging star to prove that it was still viable in the field. . The reason why there are many more supporters of Russell's version (apart from the fact that you can not improve the original) is that Russell was present, she absorbs all the scenes, while Lucille Ball could be a patron in the background of screen in Mame for All the attention she sends on paper.
