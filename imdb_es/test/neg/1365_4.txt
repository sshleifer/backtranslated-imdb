I must admit that I am not a big fan of satanic horror films and, in fact, I seem to like them every time I see a new one, and that is not really surprising when I end up watching movies. Like the Brotherhood of Satan! Despite its low IMDb rating, I was surprised to hear some good things about this movie and my expectations increased. This turned out to be a big mistake, since this is exactly the movie that, according to its classification, is: very bad! The plot is their basic group of Satanists that cause problems, and we focus on a small city where people have been killed and kidnapped and it is not really clear why. Naturally, the Satanists are behind this and this is bad news for a mother, a father and a daughter on a road trip who get trapped in the mysterious city. I had the feeling that this movie could be in the same line as the satanic fucking movie "The Devil's Rain", and although it is not as stupid as Robert Fuest's later film, it is not much better either. The plot seems to be quite realistic, but it is also quite boring and I can not say that I enjoyed it during this movie. The Brotherhood of Satan obviously has its admirers, but I am not one of them; This is a movie that I see no reason to recommend ...
