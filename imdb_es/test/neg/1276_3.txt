If you are a child who enjoys the adventures of the "real life" of fairy tales, look at it. If you are a young person and you like movies for children, why not watch them? :) If you are a father who is going to watch a movie with your children, you are VERY BETTER to choose the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie was a bit of fun, and established something good Locals for the events to take place. But after the kind of funny introduction of characters, scenarios and potential conflicts, the story was a bit boring. When the same things happen more or less for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" comes to mind repeatedly as parts of a dented LP or those commercials that you really hate. And the culmination of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
