This is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. Period. This movie goes beyond the ridiculous, it's as if the director wanted actors to sue him for misinterpreting their roles as the fantastic four, I think the movie should have gone on sale in comic stores to know how you should say it , desperate freaks who can not get enough cheese and want to watch more and more fucking movies. To conclude my paradoxes and thesis, I believe in this movie. has had great disadvantages in the future of the collaborators of the cast, with the exception of the character of Jay Underwood, in which I think it was his best performance, considering roles as not very human films in which the story is told in a way that has no character. He can not act, and people have made good decisions not to go see his films, so it is very likely that he will not be a great role, unless he awakens his career in a very rare but interesting way. .
