Wings Hauser and his son, Cole Hauser, come together to make a film about neo-Nazi thugs targeting a gay man and terrorizing a city. Alas plays the hero, and his real life son is the villain. Film with a very low budget that does not have many tradable characteristics and, for some reason, nobody has seen it! Maybe because it's a ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio realized this! Perhaps Wings Hauser himself prevented the distribution of 'Skins', after seeing it for himself! Maybe people just did not want to comment on such a bad movie! Oh good! In general, I like Wings and Cole as actors, but this was a movie that both should have skipped. Wings directed, wrote and was the lead actor in 'Skins'. An extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 out of *****!
