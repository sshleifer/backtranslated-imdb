I just wanted to leave a quick comment, since it is not heard here, but I just saw this movie, the version that I just rented was launched in 2005 for what I know and it was actually called "Do not enter the attic". "I just realized that it was the same movie as Devils Harvest in search of some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie, anyway, I'm in Ireland, so maybe this has only been released here and now in the United Kingdom, but that's what it's called here .......... I really do not like it because I would not recommend this movie. The only words that come to my mind when I see it are CHEESE CHEESE! out of ten is purely for a bit of jumping: o)
