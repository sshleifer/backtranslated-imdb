My mom and I, we rent this movie. I mean, we love that kind of science fiction movies, whether they're big Hollywood movies or Indy movies. <br /> <br /> But, they cheated us! Two journalists are investigating a UFO hijacking in a small town in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things become Christian with us. My mother and I believe in God and in Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie preached made him annoyed. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but we even like to have fun. So do not blame the Christians as a whole, just blame the Christians who need to take the fun out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the directors' position on UFOs, and that is that he believes everything is demonic. Now, I could say a few words, but I will not. All I will say is that you DO NOT watch this movie, unless you feel like being preached. In fact, he often affirms that we must be perfect to be able to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.
