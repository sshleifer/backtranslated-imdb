I just saw this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, it's not even fun in a bad movie. One of the best monster movies I've seen in my life. In addition, the television reporter in the film was the annoying Jerri of a past season of Survivor. The only fun was that the "secret base" was the home of Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows, the place is located in the area of ​​L.A.). I expected Mr. Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If Tattoo had been devoured by the snake, I could have given this movie a 2, but good. Seeing people standing there and screaming for five minutes while Komodo or the cobra was pouncing on them instead of running, it was really fun, especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming in an empty place where the computer animators would later Paint on the monster. However, I almost fell off my chair when, in a flashback scene, they brought the cobra or the komodo, then of normal size, into an indestructible solid steel vessel with some perforated air holes. Would not a wire cage have been enough? Haha I guess they could not afford to rent a real komodo and a cobra. I have to remember that I rented Showtime for their series and not for their movies.
