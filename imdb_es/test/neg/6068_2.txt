For a movie that I really expected, I was very disappointed. I had no expectation that this was another Amadeus, but I expected a more significant representation of the Beethovens of recent years. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris's performance was excellent, but the story was so weak that the film simply moved from one gloomy scene to the next without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only nice part of the movie for me was the performance of 9, and from that moment on, I could have left without finishing. <br /> <br /> I left feeling very dissatisfied and I still have the feeling that something important was lost.
