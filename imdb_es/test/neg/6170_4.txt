Mickey Rourke hunts down Diane Lane in Killshot of Elmore Leonard. It's not as if Mickey Rourke had disappeared. He has had a constant series of appearances before returning to the scene. It was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a complete presentation of the character that is only insinuated in Get Carter. Every time we meet him, Rourke is still a thin, cool ball, but of poor quality and muscular. <br /> <br /> This is a story and production by Elmore Leonard. Leonard wrote such notable films as the western thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. This means that we have hard guys, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we have narrow and realistic plots with characters that do what is best for them in every situation, turning the complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is not different. The hard and thin ball killer Rourke unhappily stalks the witness Lane. Think History of Violence is not a country for old people. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as those two, but it's almost as good. If you like those two, including the equally wonderful Eastern Promises of David Croneberg, you will also like Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden has not made many movies. His last few were pleasant, if not successful: Proof, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane has not had a powerful role in the film since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Infidelity. Lately she is charming and attractive in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here you are right, balancing your sexy appeal with reserved tension. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. However, Dawson does a good job with that. You'll see much more of Lane, including a lingerie scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> While you're in the criminal drama section, you can also choose Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang and Gone Baby Gone, and before the devil knows your dead. The latter has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot collapsed at the box office. More is our luck. Definitely worth a 3-4 dollar rent, if you like this genre. 06/20/2009
