Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this ridiculously simplistic attack on South African politics. It is not as if the United States were the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love, and the fact that the film is set on stage is an additional irony. the city that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the Police Department that did a lot for community relations with its brutal racist behavior. Therefore, Donner's salt and pepper combination, which clearly has a late adolescent infatuation with each other, does its thing without worrying about the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and nobody cares because the bad guys are the white South Africans. Worrying example of police racism in itself? Inside the office of Rudd (Joss Ackland - eminently hissable), the decoration is designed and lit to resemble the Fuhrerbunker as much as possible and, in case some foolish fans miss the point, he and his men receive the name of "Nazis" at regular intervals. For me, the only bright spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson appeared in a rally against apartheid with a banner with the inscription "End Aparthied Now". The heavily irritating Joe Pesci enters the franchise to take some weight off the shoulders of children by following them non-stop, like a poorly trained puppy. This would be bearable if there were the remotest possibility that it would end up in a concrete shelter, but unfortunately survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in a world of her own, perhaps not believing her luck to be thrown next to Mel Gibson, who has little trouble putting her to bed in her mobile home, which seems to have been washed on a beach somewhere place. Shortly after consummating it. Some of them are shot at from a series of helicopters that fire enough shots at Mel's caravan to keep the US Army. UU in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a dog that is not afraid to cause interrupted intercourse as they do for a few seconds and their barking warns them of the imminent attack. I hope you received a special bone as a reward. The film reaches the climax (without Mel's dog interruption) on a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa), when Mel and Danny kill so many members of the main race that I lost count. Despite moving like Bonnie and Clyde. The impact of a hail of bullets, Mel survives, huddled in the arms of his companion as a small child with a wise and benevolent father. Take that, apartheid!
