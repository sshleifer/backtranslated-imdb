The DVD of this film is from Alpha Video, a company that almost always publishes the worst quality prints. In Alpha's defense, that is often the only impression available, but it specializes in public domain and cheap movies. If you can find another impression of a different company, try it first, since the printing of this film is rough and fuzzy. Still, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this is excellent, especially since the sound is fairly clear (and Alpha seems to never include hidden subtitles, even with movies with a horrible sound). <br /> <br /> A man has been dating a lady for a long time. One night, he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he tells his fianc√©e, she forgives him and they get married. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the wedding, he receives a frantic call from the other woman: he NEEDS to see him and has just tried to commit suicide. When they meet, he finds out that she has a sexually transmitted disease and she wanted him to know that he, too, could have it. So even though there's a nurse there and they're treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! He makes a big mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he does not tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets with the boy and tells him the importance of receiving treatment and shows him rooms full of horribly infected people (in reality, these were only movies of people with sexually transmitted diseases who joined the movie, the majority who have syphilis). <br /> <br /> Somehow, the movie is very progressive. It addresses a serious problem and it is interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married, but to marry quickly and give in to those sexual needs, but only between them (they are not advice at all). On the other hand, the movie never says exactly what it is about. They never use the terms STD, VD or similar, they do not even name diseases. Often refers to syphilis, but sometimes it is herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases (information is not very clear or specific), a very common problem with this type of movies of this era. Audiences at that time must have been quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive people probably needed some of their "quickest" friends to explain everything to them. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "movies of this kind", in the 30s and 50s, many small and often shoddy production companies made movies denouncing the dangers of drugs and sex (although often they really they just wanted to promise a bit of Cheesecake to the public that normally could not see such spicy food in Hollywood movies, many of them are hysterically funny because they are too exaggerated and the information is so inaccurate. they are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit production company) and compared to what these two films are, this cheap movie looks like it should be in the Criterion Collection! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there are weird bugs out there (I would definitely be included among them) who enjoy watching movies because they are often so bad and so horribly done that they are very funny. It is SO bad nor the message that is twisted and the film of the victims is not as grotesque as some similar movies. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 movie it's pretty good, despite the bad acting sometimes and the ridiculous scene of suicide. Remember the children, just say 'NO' to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" of those who speak in the film were actually the norm for syphilis in 1933. Today it is much more treatable, like the rest of the STDs.
