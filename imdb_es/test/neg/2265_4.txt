I read the book 'Scarlett' and I expected a good movie the first time I saw it. I'm afraid to say that I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes I did not like in the way Lord Fenton was portrayed. There was no point in making him a bad man. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was very different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> There was also much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the film than was originally written in the book. The film sent the two in two completely opposite ways and did not seem to cross enough to make it seem like there could still be love between the two. A good movie, but I think it certainly could have been better than it was, more faithful to Alexandra Rippley's book.
