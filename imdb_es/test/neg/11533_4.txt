The only reason why any of the hundred or more users saw this movie was because they belong to the team, were friends of the team or were obsessive fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. Personally, I follow the "cult of Lance", so I was disappointed to see that, despite being the head of the cartel, it is only in name. Playing the rich criminal from Newcastle, Lance is a pleasure to watch, but all his time on the screen is relegated to the beginning of the movie. Newcastle establishes a 747 holdup that includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a bunch of forgettable characters. The biggest impact for this viewer was that the scenes prior to the robbery were not so bad. With the exception of Aviva Gale, which is somewhat unpleasant and somewhat confusing, which combines all the lines with the delicacy of an elementary theater actress, the performance was decent, and none of the lines really made me tremble. > But once the robbery occurs, the film falls asleep. His plan is not only the most ridiculous thing that has been captured in the film, but it went on for too long. This is not a very deep movie, and you have to complete your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I almost fell asleep at two in the afternoon. A particular sequence in which we observe each and every one of the characters performing the same task over and over again is especially difficult to overcome. The name of the film is "Quick Exchange", but the exchange is far from being fast, it is too long and inflated. Maybe it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but, come on, there are many things you can ask for in a direct video transmission of Showtime Extreme. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are several laughter, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a master of disguise, which creates a pair of incredibly strange scenarios), and Lance returns at the end of the film, although be for a short period of time. It's a bad movie, and I probably did not have to tell you, but it's far from the worst I've seen. I would not put it too high on the list of Henriksen's films, since it has been in some real gems with more time on screen, and anyway the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist starts, but it's the best I can tell. Rapid Exchange is that the last two movies I saw before were the main Hostage and the overrated and pretentious Crash, and this was better than both.
