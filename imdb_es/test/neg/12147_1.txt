Its has to surely be one of the worst gay-themed movies of all time. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound, bad script, gestures so exaggerated that they defy reality. A nightclub scene with a single actor and audience scenes applauded. <br /> <br /> After watching other low-budget films made in a similar way, I prepared myself for something innovative, but not just pathetic. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such a gut. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - There is no access to the menu; It's worse than a VHS tape. Once you start, you have to see everything - fortunately, the fast-forward button works - with this movie and DVD nothing else does.
