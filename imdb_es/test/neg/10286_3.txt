If you find the representation of violent murders and unbridled police brutality expressed in a less entertaining plot with a glacial rhythm, then you are bound to enjoy the Vigilance. This movie was garbage for both the mind and the spirit. The notion that this is a "thriller" is funny; That would involve some kind of tension and turns. You are still waiting for the story to end "to begin". It never rises above a glorification of violent, weak-minded criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine all the violence of "It's not country for old people" without any kind of persecution or sympathy. The emotion killers are running crazy. The acting is good, mostly, but the script is a stack. Do not bother, and tell your friends not to bother.
