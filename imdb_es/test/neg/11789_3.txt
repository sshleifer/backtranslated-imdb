I really wanted like this movie. Great cast? Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a sailor with musical inclinations (is a man in a submarine a sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as scientist With a penchant for sharks. Maybe it's a good movie for children, but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underutilized. I guess it was a red herring, like Pidgeon? You expect him to go crazy and try to throw the hero or his girl into the shark tank. There is no such luck. By the way, why is there a shark tank in a submarine? It is typical of the lack of ambition of the film. They explain why Lorre is walking with the shark from side to side (because we are seeing it), but they just expect us to accept the fact that there is a shark in this submarine for some reason. "Investigation?" Yes, scientists are always doing that research, who can understand them? Of course, if there were not a shark, who would kill the evil psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even children's films in the 50s are capable of being less predictable and downright stupid (not to mention exploits). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes really gave me hope. Great musical theme sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon leads Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear actually, I'm sorry, Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, careful to skip the room with the huge "WARNING" sign on the door, beyond Peter Lorre with the sharks mentioned. And then we see a full screen capture of Eden waving his money maker with the passionate game of Avalon's horn! The movie quickly goes down there. There is no real explanation for the firestorm that threatens Earth, so there is a clear lack of dramatic tension and there is no villain to kick. Instead, the Pidgeon character becomes an unconvincing fake track of the Ahab variety (I guess "Caine's Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly becomes evil without No reason at the end. Oh, I guess the reason is that it's a surprise to the audience. And it's a bit surprising, since the only negative thing she's done is to speak ill of the captain's mental health and there's still no reason why he did the sabotage after it was revealed that he was the villain. Very badly done and unconvincing. The guy who was the nightmare of the pessimistic bible was better? At least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> So, what else could go wrong? Endless and endless images of diving. I never understand the appeal of that kind of thing. A giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, only to have a monster for the theatrical trailer. Maybe that tricked some people into thinking it was going to be a fantastic adventure movie, rather than a half-hearted thriller about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? Perhaps worst of all, it's just a fantasy movie, much less a science fiction movie. He never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing more than another disaster / apocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery. I'm done with Irwin Allen. Anyway, I never liked his latest films, but this made me pretend that I'm Jules Verne when in reality it's just another formula for escape from disaster. The whole movie is waiting to see which character will improbably become evil and die. He always hired an actor / actress with a charming and nice screen character to play these roles and that is the only element of "surprise" that is found, since anyway there is no logic for these characters. What a pathetic waste of time for these actors. George Pal films are 100 times better (the only one that was unconvincing was "Atlantis", which, not coincidentally, was the most Allen-esquire), full of wonder and excitement. Think about it! ?? ideas! Apart from some effects scenes and Barbara Eden, in my opinion there is nothing worth seeing here. I guess it's a lot of fun for those in disaster movies, but I think they're a hollow, boring genre of movies.
