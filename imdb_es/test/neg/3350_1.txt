I received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday, which I had obviously picked up for 99p from a tray of bargain videos. <br /> <br /> I had never been so frustrated when watching a movie, it was tedious, Adam West was wasted (literally) and, in retrospect, I can not remember a single thing about it. My lack of pleasure grew to such an extent that, as soon as the credits accumulated, we broke the tape and hung the tape around the living room. Just in case, we set fire to the cover.
