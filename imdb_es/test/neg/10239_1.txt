I have seen several theatrical and cinematographic adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and she has to take the cake as the worst of all. My family bought the DVD without suspecting and could not even do it during the first half. Later I went back and forced myself to see everything (it had been a Christmas present for me) and I was horrified. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor (and it's barely enough to save the entire show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It is one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken seriously. Apart from that, the songs are half songs, the melodies are half melodies and even Meryl Streep can not make this address look good.
