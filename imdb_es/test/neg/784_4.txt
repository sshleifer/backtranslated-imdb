First of all. Should Cameron Diaz be allowed to act again? Calling that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances. That was a historically horrible performance. Any small chance that Diaz has had of being a serious actress is now completely over after that. Laughably horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the movie was extremely boring, and not very stimulating. I can sit down and reflect on human nature without having to see terrible actors, interpret a terrible story. <br /> <br /> In the third place, there was not a single nice character, and what is worse, it seemed that he had done it. design. You were not supposed to like them, or feel sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted everyone to die to be honest. Aliens included. Kid included. Everyone was just a big disappointment in this movie. They all literally rode a bicycle, and they called it a movie. You could barely distinguish the "employees" zombies with normal people, because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters, to the literal line of the story, everything seems random. This is just a really bad movie, disguised and expressed as a "thinking film for man", which must be confused. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
