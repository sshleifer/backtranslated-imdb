If you want to see the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some miserable movies can be seen because they are involuntarily fun. Unfortunately, American Movie has no wit, no unintentional humor, only obscenities that its director thought were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this movie, I suggest you watch Kevin Smith's "Clerks" similar in tone. In Clerks you'll find creativity, wit and fun, all on a tight budget. I should make you forget this horrible effort.
