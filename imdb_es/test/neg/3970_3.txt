Parts: The Clonus Horror is not as bad as in a movie. I have the MST3K version on a tape and it's very funny, but it's still not the worst movie I ever made. I would dare to say that it was better than 80% of the films that have been mocked. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it were not so boring and had a little more emotion. Unfortunately it was unsuccessful in production and ended in MST3K.
