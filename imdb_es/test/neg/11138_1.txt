I think the trash really sucks. I saw him a couple of weeks ago and I have not seen that kind of c ** p in the cinema since John Waters' Female Trouble and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; It stunk, it was so bad that it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But, actually, I'm glad I saw it, because then I could express my honest opinion about it. One should see this movie, even if it stinks.
