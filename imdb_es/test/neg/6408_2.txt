Not only because of that theme in the movie. What was one of the excuses for something that resembles the plot. No. <br /> <br /> I saw this, knowing that I would not like it. I hate numerology. Every time someone starts talking about patterns with numbers, I feel the need to slap them. My own brain begins to ache for empathy. And fully aware that this is a movie on that subject, I could not resist the temptation to see it and maybe laugh. But it was not funny. Exactly the foolish guy "Is not this totally scary and yet incredibly cool? I can turn any shit into 23!" Dialogue that I was afraid As soon as the son started ringing, I knew that this movie is crap, no matter what happens. But I almost never stop watching a movie that I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. <br /> <br /> The film simulates mocking numerology with the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. But he's riding that wave as much as he's supposed to crush it. I do not see that message I only see characters who talk about a stupid number with a little argument to justify. <br /> <br /> Top it off with the usual "surprises": try to put another spin to confuse you, that does not make sense, and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narrative up there, and you get a hollow piece to make movies. That simply focuses on the subject that I despise. I wish I did not try to be serious and it would have been a hilarious movie with actors that do not matter to me. But I was starting to like Carrey ... although it's not his fault, he's trying. It is not even good to see with a group of friends and mst3k to the devil. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for someone to trip them, but this movie managed to be one of the best. The worst I've ever seen.
