My friends and I have seen this so many times that I have lost count. It is worth seeing in the right mood, which means that it is not so much a good horror movie as a fashion movie because of its funny quotes and bad effects. This movie looks better with other like-minded people, so you have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh while Greg jumps and shuffles through the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback moves to the right. to the left on his back. "Greg, stop doing antics!" Rega√±a Dr. Brandon. You will laugh like J.G. Patterson signals with his hand to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is on the shot. And you'll probably laugh when you realize that the final woman does not have any of the characteristics she used to build it.
