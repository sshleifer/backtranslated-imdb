To think that I could only improve was the worst assumption I have made ... <br /> <br /> Drivvle does not describe this movie properly! <br /> <br /> Not only the plot is thin, but I feel more emotional when acting on my pet! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor who tries to make the best of what little he has to work with ... <br /> <br /> I think a cardboard cut out of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job and, in fact, was more animated. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs! This could be really dangerous to your health!
