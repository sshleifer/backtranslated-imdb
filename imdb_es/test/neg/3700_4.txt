"Haaaarrrryyy!" <br /> <br /> The amplified and dispassionate female voice may have been Leona Helmseley in heat, but no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the Woman of the 50-foot title. In the most infamous role of his film career, Allison's performance literally rips from the ceiling. In fact, make that a couple of ceilings. <br /> <br /> Leaving the mouth open, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a neurotic and boring heiress and her loving husband Lothario, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred in front of The Amazing Colossal Man) . Nancy has a close encounter with the third guy, in the desert, with a bald giant from outer space who wears a miniskirt and gladiator sandals, and who has something with Nancy's jewelry. What she does to him once she has taken her away is probably the best thing that remains in a mystery, but soon Nancy begins to grow. <br /> <br /> Stepping into the city center, the tranquilizers, wrapped tightly in nothing but the sheets on the bed, the gigantic giant goes to the low-income room where Harry is laughing with a Floozy called Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation becomes ugly. <br /> <br /> The row of poverty f / x makes the alien giant and Nancy appear transparent due to images transposed incompetently. You will understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz in the credits. Juran was no stranger to the direction of giant creatures, human and not, having directed "The Deadly Mantis", "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", "Jack, the Giant Killer" plus several episodes of "World of Giants" and "Land" of TV. of the giants ". <br /> <br /> Many laughs for the wrong reasons.
