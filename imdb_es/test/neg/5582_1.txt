It's amazing how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. For those of you who appreciate the meticulous special effects and the inconceivable details in each shot, you will see this movie with amazement. Simply because Predator Island does not contain any of this. It's a redundant remake of all horror monster movies in the last two decades. Now I appreciate the bad horror movies, they have a touch of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that, therefore, will be involved in the Cult Hall of Fame, then my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity and get some talent. Oh, and a few extra dollars to put in your photo. <br /> <br /> A cinematic tradition of terror has been to surprise the public with violent deaths and gore. However, the shock does not occur for more than a few seconds. To really evoke a satisfactory reaction from the paying crowd, there must be character development, some identifiable traits. I know, you're probably saying that this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he's just saying an amateur comment. Well, that's going to show you how amateur these filmmakers are. <br /> <br /> Despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a positive side. The performance of Dan Gordon as Chris is splendid. He is not given anything to work on a script and yet he can leave that movie like a star. Of all the actors, he is the only one who believes in what he is reciting. Not only does it provide the audience with someone we can identify with, but we also have someone we hope to see so we can see the rest of the movie. Gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to perform quality work and overcome a major obstacle, which is the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner rather than later. That is, if he can escape movies like this that will stop him.
