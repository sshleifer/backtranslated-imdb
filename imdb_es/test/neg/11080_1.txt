Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the worst movie I have had the pleasure of not being able to watch, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast forward button. Made in a budget somewhere close to $ 1.99, "The Cavern" is obviously a cheap product made in the current group of terrible caverns: piles of dark claustrophobic darkness, unknown threats like "The Cave" and "The Descent" . A few years ago, there was a series of similar films that used sea boats instead of caves. They all had terrifying boats / submarines, heaps of darkness, claustrophobic adventurers, unknown threats ... the same old and old. "The Cavern" is really "The Blair Witch Project" only this time we are lost under the earth and not lost on it. He throws a flashlight with defective batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued to it like a monster, and one of the stupidest "turn" climaxes ever filmed. That said, let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Stay away from this movie.
