I do not understand why this movie was released, it looked like something you showed to your classmates after you lent your mother a portable camera that she bought in 1987. I'm Australian and I work for a video store in the UK and I thought that if an Australian film entered our store, can not be so bad ... boy, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, they are lying or are the creators of the movie. <br /> <br /> The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the performance, was the WORST performance in the MOVIE HISTORY. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed and offended that they have used the word 'Aussie' in the title because I am proud of being Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give people the wrong idea. <br /> <br /> Please, anyone who reads this and has seen this movie, take the time to look for other Australian films to watch because you can choose any of them and it would be better than that. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie if I took a camera, filmed my video, but for an hour, I ate the movie, I waited for it to pass through my body and then I threw what went to the TV ... no offense. <Br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!
