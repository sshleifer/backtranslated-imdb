A movie of 'Wacky Chick'. A beauty contestant ends up dead and the usual suspects are rounded. Another entry into the vein of the Texas Cheerleader, this is an average example of its kind. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth becomes her usual healthy girl performance, and Jill Clayburgh does a good job while she stresses slightly. obsessed mother. <br /> <br /> Some slightly amusing moments when listening to the vain self-service public relations that come out of the mouths of the participants. ('I would like to own a restaurant to be able to give leftover food to the homeless'). <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what people are using to think when they think it's a cheerleader's place or it's worth killing for the beauty crown. <br /> <br />
