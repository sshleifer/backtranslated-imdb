20 people rated this to 10! That urn was filled better than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkeys, here is a traditional story hoping to go back to the current fashion of poker, without success. Counting completely in linear flashback, and when I say "counted" I mean TALKED TO DEATH, this movie is never enough when words can be used to expose. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's childhood fascination with letters and his associations with thugs can sound like interesting movie material, but the director manages to take their lives. At no time did I feel the slightest sympathy for Unger, a genius of the cards who threw all that into other forms of play in which he was not so competent. Of course, this leads, as we go through THREE musical assemblies, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, the loss of the family and, finally, its redemption (more or less). Great yawn!
