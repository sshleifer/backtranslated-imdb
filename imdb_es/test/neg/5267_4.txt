I really wanted to see this movie. It had all the ingredients of a great sassy tongue, but it just did not come together. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except that sometimes he forgot to use it and would prefer NOT to have to listen to the pale attempt of Linda Fiorentino. She and Helen Baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality, fortunately, their screen children had many people, so they could find at least some members of their 2 endearing families. You could have thrown spaghetti with the plot and I'm sure the script was written by a teenage schoolboy in an English high school competition. That said, when I was not cramped, I was smiling, so it was not a total waste of 90 minutes. The superposition of Kevin's face in the painting seemed very intelligent and quite funny. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but I was expecting a quality display and it never came.
