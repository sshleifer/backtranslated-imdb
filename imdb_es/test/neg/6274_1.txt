This movie is so bad that they should burn the teacher. You can not spoil the plot because this movie does not have one. The graphics are less than false, they are horrendous. Then you have the wandering through the field of observation of stars work-a-holic that bounces between your own madness and the crazy dismissals of the maddened preacher. And when he finally arrives in DC, they do not even have the decency to kill him; the monster (that you do not know at that moment) is already dying, but how ... who knows and, of course, has the final and happy ending ... everyone else on the planet is dead or dying, but his family and a handful of the stragglers survive. Imagine that! This will be the movie that C Thomas Howell will go to his grave regretting having starred. Probably give you nightmares.
