Some of the best and most beloved horror films have a perverse sense of humor, but when a movie appears, it is not as original as the "classics", but it laughs and laughs a handful of people. It completely criticizes the scum. This movie made me laugh out loud several times, this is a testament to the way this film was approached and shown. The two main cables look natural and believable together and this really helps this movie. You encourage them all the way and laugh with them, they all have friends like these two guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it is impressive, intimidating and very well filmed. Taking inspiration (completely stealing) from a lot of movies, the most obvious is Duel, Jeepers Creepers and, probably, in reference to Orange County co-star, Jack Black. But you can really choose any road trip that has gone wrong from the movie and find a reference here. But so what? It's not about winning an Oscar. Just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughter and at that point it's a 10! Obviously, he is not getting a 10, I give him reasonable criticism and scores as opposed to 99% of people in IMDb. There is no way that this film can get a zero as many lazy idiots give too many movies and, as funny as it is, is not getting a 10. It's just a funny movie for anyone who has a sense of humor and likes fears . You really can not be simpler than that.
