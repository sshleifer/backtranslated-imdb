I've only seen the episode of the minimum wage, but I have no intention of seeing others, how can that be? Morgan begins to complain theatrically of his terrible situation living with the minimum wage just at the beginning of the episode and the complaint never stops. Forever. Fortunately for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is as annoying as Morgan (or even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And to top it off, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2.50 and after that, go to a restaurant to eat all the time, naturally, they "drum", they complain about being poor . <br /> <br /> I do not care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. Nobody should be forced to see this shit.
