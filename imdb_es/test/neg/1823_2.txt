Simply miserable vehicle Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but rarely uses it in a movie that reminds me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is not an important man either. It looks like an old man ready to collect social security and go fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds have very little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke arrives at the end to announce that it is better for our King Ezio to return with his people. As far as I'm concerned, the faster the better. Does Lana Turner really sing with Pinza? It's not bad if it's her. The image would also remind me somewhat of the 1960 film "The Prince and the Showgirl" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
