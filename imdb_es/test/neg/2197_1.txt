We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand the binary and those who do not. Those who understand the binary put this movie in his grave along with the hackers, while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake of which none of this shit can happen. Forever. <br /> <br /> For a movie to try to be a modern movie with applied fiction. It has failed. Terribly. Only a child of 11 years or less can enjoy and only 30 years or more may be afraid of having their identity taken. It is lost in the main market for a resale value (I notice it is now more boring than when it was first launched).
