Martin Lawrence is not a funny man in Runteldat. He just has too much in mind and is too angry, which makes his word games come out pretty early in the game. Try to mock the critics, who are reduced to "fuck them." Then he goes on pretty primitive sexual jokes about smokers with throat cancer and just goes downhill from there. 3/10
