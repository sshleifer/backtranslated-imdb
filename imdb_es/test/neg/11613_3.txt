While the prominent use and excessive use of the game format is in full operation throughout the film, this is not what this image allows. Rather, they are the unconvincing female performances and the rather tedious script that the film so obviously confided too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is further diminished by the fact that Graham has not truly expressed the devastation that his character so firmly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two women leaders could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr. proves, as usual, that he is a talented actor, he shades the two actresses in their scenes together, which is constantly noticed. The useless but intense sex scene seems to exist simply to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive, which gives the actors a well-deserved rest to talk about. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and Guy has very little to recommend, apart from the formidable performance of Downey Jr, if it were not.
