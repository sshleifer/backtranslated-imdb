This was something I had been waiting to see. The Ultimate Avengers movies had exceeded my expectations and, since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought that this same production team could do really cool things with a solo Iron Man title. But the final movie It was unsatisfactory. I did not expect them to spend most of the film paying tribute to Iron Man's gray armor. The red and gold armor is seen for about ten minutes or so all together. It's not a major complaint, but it's not what I expected from the ads and the box. The worst, however, was the CGI story, acting and animation shaded by the monster cell and Iron Man's armor that was not convincing. It did not combine well with the animation of the cell at all. Even in itself it seems like a stick and lifeless. The character arc of Tony Stark, as incredibly slow as necessary, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after forcing myself through the movie, I wondered if they could not have found something that would have been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
