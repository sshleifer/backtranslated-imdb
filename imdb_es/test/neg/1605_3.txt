I expected this show to be a bit realistic. It hit me like a show more than the mainstream after I saw it. I did not feel the characters at all, is this glamorous American idea of ​​how terrorism works? The main character does not act as a fundamentalist at all, and the way he pretends to be a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. None of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine. One of the members, a totally white American blond boy, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a former French skinhead, does not fit into an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition to this, terrorists have sex with white American housewives, which seems very strange to me. This is just another stupid misunderstanding of American television. It's as realistic as Prison Break.
