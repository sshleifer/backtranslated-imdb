It is not a good one -Absolutely. <br /> <br /> This installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the Amityville house who must face his past to rid himself of the terror of the Amityville nightmare. <br /> <br /> Basically it's nothing. My bet is that this movie was made for a little quick money to buy a boat or something ... because it's ridiculous ... Fortunately, it does not kill or ruin the series, but it has no effect on The series at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that just the fact that you are constantly referring to the old and infamous house is probably the only thing that makes it a little more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".
