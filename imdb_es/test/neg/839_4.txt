There is a considerable amount of money behind this production, so its appearance is very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short cameo at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are some exciting shootings, and a bit of humor or two: the satire of Django, the man without a name, and Sabata are fun, especially when they receive the names of failed presidents of the Mexican Revolution. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is no purpose in lampooning the Spaghetti Western as attempted here. The key element in Spaghettis is IRONY, which is easily combined with comedy; in fact, the source of all the Spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most of the Spaghetti slipped easily into the real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films, which are openly Spaghettis and openly a slapping comedy. So, why bother to satirize a genre that, by its very nature, satirizes itself? Consequently, I found that the entire company was essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people that I would care about, the story was a generic cliché, and the production values ​​only reflected the money involved, not the director's passion. In general, a banal and useless effort to take advantage of the phenomenon that mocks.
