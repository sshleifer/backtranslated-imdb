In general, I prefer horror movies that scare me so much that I'm scared of the next day, not the ones where people act stupidly and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of the legend is a lizard-skin monster with the face of a greenish-gray dog ​​that jumps like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp thorns protruding from its back and sucks the blood of cattle. As in many horror films, good and bad, this film is released with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but it eats its intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So, tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate your skin when bullets can not? And why, when the Marines realize that the perforating bullets can damage it, do they separate so that the chupacabra can knock them down one by one? John Rhys-Davies offers a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the performance went from bad to bad, like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
