I always hated this delayed show. I liked the Cartoon Network shows like "The Dexter Lab" or "Megas XLR, but I never liked this piece of turd, basically because it has stupid characters (the good ones or the villains seem to be mentally retarded) have stupid voices (especially Bubbles). She's supposed to be the "cute" character of the show, but it's incredibly annoying.) The story lines are very, very stupid, some episodes might have been interesting, but almost always the show became childish and corny. no nice character, the music was horrible and the animation is the worst I've ever seen, even a five-year-old could draw better! I do not see why everyone seems to love this piece of garbage. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems Being one of the worst cartoons ever made, fortunately, "the foster home for the imaginary friends" of the same creator was much better.
