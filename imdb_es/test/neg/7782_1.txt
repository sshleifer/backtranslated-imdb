Look no further, that is, the worst movie ever made. There may be others who are tied, but there is none worse. Can not be. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on a sell-out laser disc for $ 3.25, and I thought that no movie with those actors might not be worth that price. It turns out that it's worth tripling that, since at least they should have paid me to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie, they replaced someone else, someone younger and prettier, to make it look more attractive.
