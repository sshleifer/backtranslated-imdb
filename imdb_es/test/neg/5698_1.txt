I'm surprised that someone would really consider spending some money on a movie like this. Really. Let's forget for a second that the plot does not even give a touch of originality ... Most movies today are based on stories from other movies, so a "simple" lack of originality is not so important. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that any of the guys involved in the movie have boarded a plane before firing this. Because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to get to something so ridiculous. To be honest, I think a 6-year-old with a fake camera could have found something technically much more credible. Some examples below. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again, the guy on the radio says something like "Ok, press buttons 1 and 2 on the board." Now, those are not buttons. They should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and towards the pilot. That's something that only an aircraft addict would know, you say? Incorrect. In the next scene you can see your fingers pressing the "buttons" ... And of course the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a millimeter! (And keep in mind that I have not even mentioned the fact that the engines of the planes are not like the engines of the cars, that you just turn the key and the magic happens ... You have to make a rather complicated procedure to turn them on ...) Come on guys! You could have faked the moves at least! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes against everything along the runway (poles of light along the runway? What are you thinking ?!) ... And the wings are not even they start! It happened to me once too ... Except that the plane was made of Lego! What's up with the stewardess? She is really so skilled that she knows exactly where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the cables behind the cab. Should we mention, then, the guy who can drive an ambulance and fly an airplane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did you ignite the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Actually, I could spend hours with these things. This is the dumbest movie I've found, and I'm including trash like Alone In The Dark and other things on the list. Do you want to do yourself a favor? Do not look at it
