ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's greats. This film about a fired policeman who ends up working for a small security system run by the mafia is very weak and is not a comedy. There are some moments that I enjoyed, like looking at Candy in a pilot suit, but it does not seem to matter much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously disappointing fake that has brought us the director of the equally foolish COMMANDO action. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
