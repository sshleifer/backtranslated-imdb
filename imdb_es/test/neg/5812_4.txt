Hedy Lamarr, who may have been kept by more men on the screen than any other actress, is again the caring mistress of Kent Taylor, the playboy of society and the general in general. On a ship from Yucatan, after Taylor gave him the brush, he tries to commit suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy saves her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is a fairly complete doctor. I guess you never heard the word specialist. He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his trip was a part of medical research. Lamarr and he get married and she tries to introduce him into her world and even becomes a partner in society, Dr. Louis Calhern. Of course, Kent Taylor re-enters the scene and the inevitable of Hollywood happens. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing I Take This Woman, it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by the Oscar-winning city, Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Dr. Karl Decker is not a patch on what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan a little romance in his life in this movie, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr did not get along very well. In fact, this movie was nicknamed I Retake This Woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg left the film, presumably because Lamarr was not working for him as Marlene Dietrich did. She made Lady of the Tropics and then MGM again filmed this with her contracted director, Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of his productions. And a new support cast was incorporated. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles in the store for both.
