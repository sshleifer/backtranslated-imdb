Ah the science fiction channel. How often do you disappoint me? I often think, do good movies ever show? OK, you've given me the big "Heroes" and the reasonably good "The Lost Room", but they're series, and as for the movie, there's nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad direction, terrible characters and a superficial history, and that's just to begin with. I checked the director Allan A Goldstien and I was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact, I'm thinking that this is a pseudo name). The facilities of four motorcyclists who cross the slogan in a national park when one of them has an accident that requires a park ranger to rescue them only to get entangled in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that he already knows every blow He happens. Leader Bryan Genesse, the park ranger, is so bad that it is terrible. Cast as the action hero of the martial arts kid, following in the footsteps of so many others, this guy makes Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. The supporting cast is a little better and long before the end , hoping that the fire would envelop everyone and then the film crew. Avoid at all costs
