I'm a big MD fan. But, I call it the way I see it. This movie was limping. The plot was absurd. Gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the local supermarket. Come on! Tone Loc has the emotion of a wooden plank. Loosen up! The edition is choppy. The actors, and use the term lightly, sound as if they were reading their lines in Valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that only shout "Stinky." <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Dudikoff movie, I suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, this is not the one that presents his work. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth and you will think that all your projects are so bad.
