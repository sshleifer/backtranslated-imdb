Honest movie, bad editing, bad lighting, nefarious dialogue and scant script. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad that there are moments that you can not even see what is happening, I even tried to play with the contrast. and the brightness so I could see something, but that did not help. <br /> <br /> They must have found the script in a container, the development of the character is just as horrible and, although it is difficult to expect much from a Jean-Claude Van Damme's film manages to reach a historical minimum . You can not even laugh at the corny. <br /> <br /> The direction and editing are also terrible, the whole movie follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every step, as it revolves the plot that is so weak is simply unreal. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say besides that it is really bad and it does not look like Jean-Claude Van Damme's previous work that you can enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid like. The plaque, frankly I miss the words to condemn this "movie".
