This movie is not a horror movie. There is nothing of fear in it, it is rather a torture. And it does not make sense to me, there are some scenes with bodies that disappear. For example, the woman at the beginning of the movie. They are dragged back to a scene in the bathroom with Nicole and she and she disappear completely. Then, she kills the police officer to get him out of his misery and he disappears MORE. He had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him. I do not think it's that special when you can see his head almost in the air and it did not kill him. ? In the end, she puts the killer's truck on fire. That, but he is not in that. He is standing behind her. Then it is cut so that the rest area has been completely remodeled and some people are in the rest area and between a new girl and Nicole asking for help as the first girl without any sense in this movie. Save yourself some money and skip this movie.
