I saw Gomeda in the movies of my city. My friend took me off and I was very curious about what it would be like. Well, I must say that this movie was not a horror, we might say that it is 'Fantsastic experimentation' ... Well, here I go anyway ... But there were many filming, acting, dramatic, theatrical and narration. . I can understand why the director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film. The direction of this movie was not so bad, I see. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions imposed on the film by its extremely low budget, the images are often as murky as the story. And there are no powerful gothic scenes. Like a horror movie, it really fails, it does not scare at all and it's pretty confusing and boring. Some people say that 'Gomeda' is an art film, but I could not see a ridiculous, terrible and abusive art movie like that. So, how can we say it's an art movie? Simply funny!
