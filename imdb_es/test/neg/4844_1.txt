Like most of you, I have seen many great movies; Among those, often, voluntarily or by mistake, we also find those movies that are so useless that we think of reasons why someone could do it. This is exactly what I can say about the dead man's reward ... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you like a movie to entertain you because of the story, the acting and the intensity, you may want to choose something else. Now, it's not all bad ... In fact, if all you want is a creative edition of unique films and angles along with the original musical environment, you might think it's okay. As someone who values ​​the plots of a movie, acting and entertaining with a movie, the truth is that I thought that this movie was so terrible that it could not be described. I could easily find a place for him on my list of worst movies seen in a while. <br /> <br /> As for having Val Kilmer in this, the truth is that it was probably released as a favor to the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I can not understand what his motive was for this. The film seems, in part, part of the romance ... In the end, I'm sure most of you can agree with me that it's just a waste of time of our time. In case you have not seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it altogether.
