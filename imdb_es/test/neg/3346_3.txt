I really want to believe that the previous quote (specifically, the translation of the subtitle in English), which was actually written, was not pronounced, in a rejection letter that an editor sends to the protagonist, it must be self-referential in a language. - Czech way. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors about the true nature of the film. Everyone is so terribly fervent in their performances that I have to conclude that Carax really takes himself seriously here, or has so much disdain for everyone, especially the public, that he can not be bothered to let anyone get involved in the joke. br /> <br /> Some authors can escape by making oblique and strange films because they do so with a unique and unique personal style (for example, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach while still weaving surreal elements in the plot of the story (for example, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the later and less strange works of David Cronenberg). In Pola X, Carax throws a disconnected mess to the viewer and then challenges him to find fault with him. Well, here it is: the rhythm is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is dispensed with; Superfluous characters abound (for example, the gypsy mother and the child); most of the actions are overloaded; Illumination is often poor, particularly in the sex scene that is often discussed; Unconnected scenes are introduced into the film without any discernible reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> In order not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some encouraging exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the industrial-techno musical cacophony that plays in the extensive abandoned complex to which the main characters retire in the second half of the film (maybe a reference to the "Factory" by Andy Warhol in the 60s?) . Much of the field photography was beautiful, an obvious attempt to contrast with the configuration of the dirty city. And, even in middle age, Cathering Deneuve shows that he still has "that." His performance was also the only one among the main characters who did not sink into robes. <br /> <br /> There was an earlier time when I considered those films as "Pola X" more charitable. The experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment does not work. But Carax does not try anything new here; The film is a pastiche of elements taken from innumerable previous films, and after several decades of watching movies and, literally, thousands of films later, I simply do not have patience for this kind of unoriginal and badly made guts. At this moment early in the 21st century, one wonders: except for Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is there * any * director in France who knows how to make a film to see more? Score: 3/10.
