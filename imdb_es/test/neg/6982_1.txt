This movie was bad but it was so bad that it can reach cult status in the distant future. A kind of black cinema joins Plan 9 of outer space. The story was, well, there really was not a story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this film proves it. "So bad that it could be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt that this movie is chosen by any legitimate distribution company, so it is unlikely to be released. <br /> <br /> I'll add that I hope to see more of actor Ron Carey. He did the best of what he had. The rest of the performance, if I can call it that, was quite forgettable. I've seen worse things in big studies with big budgets.
