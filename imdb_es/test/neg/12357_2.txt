I saw him on a boring Sunday morning this morning. Well, I was attracted by the fact that it's an outdoor movie ... I was hoping to find some beautiful landscapes, but the views were limited ... They just come and go in the same place over and over again ... I hate when they are using this so-called high-tech material like the blue Motorola headset they are using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie, it was so much fun ... they look like fans. And they liked to announce those poorly designed alien laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people ... I could not say more about this TV movie. The end was bad, it seems that the elimination was cut. the use of rescue helicopters and etc. * / **********
