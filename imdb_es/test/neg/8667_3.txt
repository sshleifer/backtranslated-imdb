For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation could be fine. But only for them. This is an unconnected version of "Cliff Notes" from Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen another version or have not read the parts of the books, you could scratch your head. <br /> <br /> Why has it been so difficult to make a good adaptation of this book? The one from the 1990s took such liberties that it hardly seemed to be the same book: the mentality was completely modern and lustful. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper, who looks like a beautiful and beautiful girl. She has a lovely personality that develops very well, but she has very flagrant blonde blond hair, with black eyebrows and, in large part of the image, dark brown roots. So much for the virgin cousin. It's incredibly annoying, and the rest of the cast is in the wrinkled and crumpled hair genre that shows a real lack of respect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here: Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford Of all the versions. It is perfect, flirtatious without being entirely modern or suggestive, frivolous and completely without any moral or ethical compass. Henry is really handsome enough to be a light temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and makes it really boring until her last scene, too. sensible. This is just a production that really lost the mark, a real low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only useful version is the one with the odd duck (perfect for the role) Sylvestra La Touzel (even though he is very gay Henry Crawford - he is just ridiculous).
