When Jim Wynorski announced for the first time that he would make a new sequel to my favorite series of all time, the series "Slaughter in the slumber party" was in ecstasy. I had been waiting for a new delivery for years. Therefore, production began and very small fragments and pieces were filmed and the actors involved were released until the shooting finished. Then, the announcement of a change of title. It would no longer be called this new sequel "Slumber Party Massacre IV", but "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a little disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a movie that had waited so long for it to happen. I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it. <br /> <br /> Maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who could watch the movie. Months before your release date. A few reviews leaked into the network and, judging by them, I started worrying about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre." <br /> <br /> Tonight, I was able to see the film for the first time in its entirety. I'm still scratching my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely not a new installment of the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a slasher movie on its own. And one bad in that. <br /> <br /> Before going into the details of the film, let me first say that I am a big fan of Jim Wynorski's films. I always thought he was a true genius of the camp, with a winner almost always. Yes, their films are made with limited budgets and do not contain the best performance, but they are fun despite everything. They are what they are: movies that you watch when you want to have a good time. From "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die" and "Chopping Mall", Jim has produced the products on more than one occasion. One of the reasons why I was excited that this movie was his last project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not reflect (in my opinion) any of the films in which I saw this director / writer create the past. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was actually filmed on a videotape, something I had never seen Jim do. The actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost ridiculous. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your old and adorable grandfather, rather than a fugitive lunatic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is full of female nudes. We are talking about a movie by Jim Wynorski, friends. But some of the shots seen here almost seem to be over. There is an extremely long shower scene, which contains the cheerleading coach, which seems to last forever and largely mirrors a shower scene in Jim's "Sorority House II". The girl even bathes herself in almost the same way. <br /> <br /> "Massacre cheerleader" is also extremely clich√©, to say the least. The opening scene is, literally, something we've all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher movies. A boy and a girl kissing, about to consummate their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are truncated into pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I never really considered a tremendous actress in the first place, also offers one of her most rigid and forced performances in her little cameo. We are talking about possible reference cards here. She recalls some incidents that her character suffered for the murderer who was seen here twenty years ago in the police, while reproducing images of the original "Massacre in the dream party". Why was the footage from the original movie used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions seen in this movie that I'm pretty sure were recycled from other movies. <br /> <br /> This film not only recycles FOOTAGE from previous films, but also recycles the scores of other films. . Part of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also recycled before "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are also at least two more that I can not identify, but I'm sure they have been used before. <br /> <br /> After reviewing the horrific performance of this film, a ridiculous story, gore / nonexistent special effects and a camcorder. -like quality, I have some serious concerns regarding the career of Mister Wynorski. Did the man who delighted the audience with films in the past finally lose his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget your new movie. A new installment in the films "Sorority House Massacre", now titled "Final Exam". I think I'm seeing a pattern here ...
