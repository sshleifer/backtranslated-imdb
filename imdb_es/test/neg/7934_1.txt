I was looking for ATTACK in Precinct 13. There, the movie is that memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can not say who the main actor is, that's a pretty important point against the film) Gabriel Byrne (who could not have needed the money so badly?) Drea De Matteo is amazing But only for his incredible body. It took me a long time to understand that she is Joey's sister of "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attack the station are pretty bad, when it comes to tactics. They even taught us better basic skills than this in the basic training of the RAF. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity in fact. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
