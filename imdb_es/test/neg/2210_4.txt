This movie is total incarnate stupidity. However, I have seen this movie several times and I plan to see it several times more because, despite its absolute stupidity, it is very entertaining. And he has one of my favorite actors from the Hokey movie, Casper van Dien, who is here in all his glory from the Hokey movie. Here, Casper van Dien is totally Casper van Dien, and you must love him for that. If he had not been in this movie, it would have been a totally incomprehensible dreck, or at least much more dreckier than it already is. <br /> <br /> The "science" (of the cough) does not make sense here. absolutely. Nobody else in the world noticed that a great asteroid is approaching the Earth besides that small group? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly looking for the heavens for such a thing? Such a large asteroid would have become completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely able to see. And a part of the asteroid bounced in the atmosphere and nobody noticed? A rock so big that it would hit the atmosphere would have caused huge shock waves that in turn would have caused a huge amount of damage to the surface of the planet. Surely, someone would have noticed something like that. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this movie is so ridiculous that, somehow, it works to make this movie as entertaining as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed is that despite the great heat, all the characters were not dripping with sweat and their clothes were completely soaked. At most, the characters seemed to have been lightly sprayed on occasion by someone outside the chamber with a bottle of water to give a "sweat shine". Authenticity was not an objective for which this film tried assiduously and constantly. Which, in a strange and hilarious way, gives this movie its entertainment charm. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching this movie? Insurance! Assuming that, of course, you have absolutely no expectation of anything that comes close to reality remotely. And, it is your desire to wallow and delight in total tranquility at this time.
