The blond strawberry has a great script, but I only wish that Errol Flynn was in him instead of James Cagney, he is not the person for the role. I think Olivia did a great job. This movie is also a dream day, so it's hard to follow. I do not like the attitude of the male character; the way Cagney presented him was simply out of place. I give it a 3 for poor performance by male main character. (If you like men with problems, who like to fight all the time and argue, this is your movie). The blond strawberry would have been better if the main character had a more positive attitude, and change the script so that he is happy that he is with Oliva. jokes Simple and simple is not the best movie, but each one must decide for itself.
