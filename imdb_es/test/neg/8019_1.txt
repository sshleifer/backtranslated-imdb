A couple of teenagers have some sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's it. They say they are fifteen years old, while one of the actors is really twenty-five. Maybe this movie was something revolutionary in 1978 in its way of playing "taboo" themes, but I can not imagine that at that moment everything that is shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. <br /> <br /> Shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even more superficial. The selection of songs does not involve anything more than the very well known "classics" that are still heard on every second radio station today. The plot of American Pie is not very different, but at least it is a bit funny. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that he had six sequels!
