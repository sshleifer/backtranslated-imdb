I sincerely wonder why this movie was made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a Berlin version where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between, it's hard to believe. The vocabulary in English is basically limited to "go fuck yourself, bastard" and the performance is worse than anyone can imagine. Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting topic, but in Germany I know that there are no gangs shooting in the middle of the street in broad daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer who kills Turkish children and paints them white. To create some tension, we see the serial killer and we hear him hum the Schubert lullaby, but we will not see his face. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that they actually filmed it in Germany. There are some shots on the street that are obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shots. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.
