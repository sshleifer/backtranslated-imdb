I'm so disappointed with this movie that I can not express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke with a leather face and that Third Rock kid from The Sun acting like a psychopath. I thought, wow, this is going to be a winner, in the style of Natural Born Killers. And it got better. The value of the production was excellent, the direction was excellent, the performance was excellent, the cinematography was excellent and the plot was, well, the plot, well, what to leave? Halfway through the movie, I was pulling my hair out and yelling "What the hell is going on?" And I say it literally? Nothing makes any sense at all. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
