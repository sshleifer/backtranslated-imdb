Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke star in this controversial story of a Wall Street executive and an employee of an art gallery that gets hooked and begins a very experimental sexual relationship. While the performance of Rourke and Basinger is fine, the flim does not allow their characters to really form. Apparently, there was a lot of movies on the floor of the cutting room that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship in them, the character of Basinger considering suicide, which would have involved the characters more for the viewer. As it is, it is a brilliant piece, well produced, with MTV style editing of soft core voyeurism. 4 out of 10
