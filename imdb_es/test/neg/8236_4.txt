Reviewing old movies that you considered average is not necessarily a good thing. Sometimes they get worse. Champions for the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone they labeled it "the most terrifying movie since Texas CHAINSAW", um, no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably developed a cult of followers as an "intense" image of terror. Actually, it's just an average stem and bar, uh, bite film that briefly moves away from the package when presenting a killer who shoots like a chicken. Yes, the goblins like a chicken. To the credit of the filmmaker, at least they did not make the killer look like a duck in the style of THE NEW YORK RIPPER. That would be simply silly. <br /> <br /> The narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that slasher movies are full of reasons, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. In reality, Luther is on probation after a long scene in which people argue that he has reformed, even though he sounds like a chicken and has shaving dentures (which he apparently trained in jail). It is the kind of movie in which a couple sees a door banged and the girl says goodbye saying: "Oh, my mother must have forgotten her keys, she has forgotten many things since my father died". The kind of movie where the hysterical mother meets a policeman looking for Luther and says: "The murderer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says, "Just show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call again? <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the movie is so full of action and dialogue so horrible because the character of Luther is quite interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a dead singer for Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, who gives the cackling Luther a genuine air of threat. In the hands of a right-wing director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a true cinematic rarity. But Albright is not that director and simply places the fascinating character of Luther in tedious traps.
