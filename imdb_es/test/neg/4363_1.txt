<br /> <br /> This movie sucks! The first one was much better. Nobody from the first one has come back in this silly sequel and somehow that's a good thing because of the bad acting, but the characters in this movie are not even better. Killjoy in the forest? Come on! Give me a break! I'm surprised that Killjoy's friend, the witch of Blair, did not show up to make a cameo. Bad acting, bad history and simply silly and boring. Do not waste your time!
