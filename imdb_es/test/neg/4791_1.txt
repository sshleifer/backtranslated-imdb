Have you seen all the great adventures of the last decades? If you do not bother with this one since you've already seen most of the scenes, and I can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure the true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that making it work in a morgue would lead to a bunch of undead angry). Each character is based on a cliché and ... well, they are nothing more than cliché. And yes, once again, all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland they announced that this is the kind of film for which the DVD was created. Maybe I should sell my player then ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
