I really enjoyed the movie. It was very cheesy at times. (They destroy the villain with the hair dryers, but where are they connected?) However, it is a unique movie, and I enjoyed the performance of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also enjoyed Fanuel (whatever you wrote ...) and he liked Megan's character because she called him dweeb. In addition to the performance, the "rewind" and show what happened in the point of view of Ariel and Megan was quite interesting. I saw it twice and I would see it again.
