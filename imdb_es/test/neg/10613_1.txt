Young writers, young authors, young actors, buses full of producers, what could go wrong? All. Even the description is too good, suggesting that three of the four legs were working, when in reality, none of them was. Just enough recycled plotting for an hour of television of 48 minutes and a half, which extended in a staggered way up to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops. Again, how many times? There was not an original fragment in all this mixture. Giovanni Ribisi made a brave effort to shore up the lack of a script, provoking the only laughs of the whole movie. And the idea that he and Claire Danes work from a real script with an adult director and photographed by a real cinematographer intrigues me. Note to the writers: Buy one of those story generators. It can not be as bad as starting a bad television. Note to the author: There are shots available for you in addition to the close-ups. Even the charming and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes boring as she approaches. Note to the director of photography: I learned with a professional for some years: you have a lot to learn. Note for the color timer in the laboratory: at least try to persuade the author and the director of photography that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this has paid for your new condo. It's time to get a professional administration and start reading the scripts before you log in.
