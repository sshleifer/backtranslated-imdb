I swear I did not want to do it! I chose it only because it looked good on my back! This movie did not give any fear and was really very confusing. The demonic wind was only used a couple of times and people were killed in a very corny way. The only bright spot was watching Sherri Bendorf from Slaughterhouse play on him. However, seeing what happened to her, I decided on this little turkey from a movie. A 3 of 10. NEXT!
