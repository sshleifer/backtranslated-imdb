This movie really loses its mark on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, the amateur acting and the comedy weak at best. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it could have been particularly nice, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to think by putting the word f * ck in each sentence, it will make it more fun and the main character seems to try a little too much. It sure is not a type of player. <br /> <br /> Next time, at least, get a cast that can maintain the accent of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It is a crime to compare this with movies like The Business, Lock Stock and Snatch.
