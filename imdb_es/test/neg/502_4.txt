The movie, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, although still tedious for more than 4 hours. But the movie took a lot of license, as is usual in Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" got married in real life. His main contribution to the Johnson County War was to start by hanging him. Well, at the beginning, I want to say that it came at the beginning, not at the end. Here is the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because a house could be given to each family. When presented as individuals alone, they could obtain two homes. They chose lands in Crazy Woman Creek that control the water on land owned by a powerful member of the Cattlemen's Association. He offered to buy them repeatedly, which they rejected. <br /> <br /> Although it is characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and a prostitute (and also in the movie), there is no real evidence that it was true. It is known that she bought many sick cattle, cared for them until they came back to life and was later accused by the Livestock Association of receiving cattle in exchange for "lewd acts". In the end, she was accused of theft, an act almost certainly is not true. Too much for this part of the myth of the "American West," which is a scapegoat for myths that span a period of time of about one hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattlemen's Association, holding hands and quickly hanged. Those who perpetrated the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of the Nate champion. and the start of the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very different from the Hollywood version that shows his shot at the end. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have accelerated the action with a more skillful edition.
