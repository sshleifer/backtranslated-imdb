When I saw Alien vs. Predator a few years ago, I have to say that, like a stupid sequel, it was something nice. Now, unfortunately there is a shortage of good films in the movies lately, so my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see what it was AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. So we saw it a couple of nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing exciting in this horror sequel. It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it's not a bad idea to take Alien and Predator and place them in the upper class suburbs, but from the idea of ​​the first that explains their reasons for existing, this It was just a sequel to average and predictable terror. Not to mention a story that continues to introduce new characters in each scene in which I was not sure who took into account who was the main character and why, so I could not follow the story. <br /> <br /> From what I have gathered, of course, the Predator and the Alien are in the space having to deal with the typical things of the neighbors of com com, simply they are turning off the lights and decide why do not. Go ahead and take it out on some earthlings. So they crash and Alien is taking over the utopia of the suburbs. But teens, including a couple with problems that look like Ken and Barbie, a sea woman and her daughter, among others, will make sure to kick the space butt, that is, if the predator does not arrive first. Because he is tempted in the Alien, I guess to start the party without him, hahaha, kidding, actually killing some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie for all levels, it is still great with many of the visual effects and the fight sequences between Alien and Predator are great to watch. Like the first sequel to Alien vs. Predator, the cast is what ruins the movie and it seems that they were not well developed, I know it's horror, but the original films of Alien and Predator had characters that interested you and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent sequel that would say it's worth checking out for fun, especially Ken and Barbie's. <br /> <br /> 4/10
