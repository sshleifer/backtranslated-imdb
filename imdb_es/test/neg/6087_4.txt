How much I love this movie? Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that is so bad that it's good. This is one of these. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a big butt, he looks fabulous on the screen, and he definitely does not make a bad turn in his debut as an actor (I think). Billy Zane is appropriately stingy and moody, although I still constantly feel that there is something else in him. I felt it in the Titanic, the expression on his face when La Winslet spit it out, for example, totally broken, surprised and dejected ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... not seriously, I think that's it! It's worth catching this to see a really attractive guy, a few stuffed with big bras from Brook, a nasty grunt from Billy, laughing at the dialogue, enjoying the scenery and the madness of the whole thing ... I'm going to see new now. - If I bought it !!!
