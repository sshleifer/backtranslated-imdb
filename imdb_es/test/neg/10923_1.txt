First things first, by no means am I a demanding movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to eliminate faults and criticize, I, like most people, look to entertain myself. Basically, I'll watch any kind of movie, no matter how bad people say it is (sometimes a movie is so terribly done and written that it invokes a kind of pity that I like a lot). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and I did not know what I was seeing. It was too badly written and cheesy to be an adult movie, and I had too much sex, innuendo and oath to be a children's movie, in fact, I doubt even kids have fun. The humor (quite generous even calling it that) was so pretentious and cheesy, that I could not see how someone with half the mind could find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie Mac and ridiculous could put their name and time on something so painful. The character of Luda was such a cheap tactic for laughter that he did not reach his goal. The plot did not make any sense at all, the story has to be the worst sequence of events that have come together on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start talking about specific examples of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that it really has to make you wonder how long these writers spent on their knees trying to achieve it. <br /> <br /> J
