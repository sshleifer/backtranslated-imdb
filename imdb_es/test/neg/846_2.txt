I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage entered his first lines, I thought he was just kidding. Cage like an Italian? I'm sorry, but the very wrong actor who is acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very loose, it could have been good, but with other actors and, obviously, with another script. The camera is great, the photography too, but why the hell did you choose Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please, do not get me wrong, I do not have anything against Cage, he has some really cool movies, but obviously he is not for all the roles. It's really a shame that the cast was not better set, because history has potential.
