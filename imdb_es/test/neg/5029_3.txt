The film is nothing more than a nude exhibition. Has anyone noticed that the three main female characters appear nude? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include a little (if not a lot) of nudes from local stars, along with the jargon that otherwise, in today's Portuguese society, is rejected by horror. If you see advertising for Portuguese films on Portuguese TVs, they have all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I am not saying, in any way, that Portuguese society is alienated; only that the film industry does not seem capable of finding other forms of success. Returning to the movie ... There is nothing left of the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been good if the real idea of ​​the book had been emphasized (current at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was horrible ...
