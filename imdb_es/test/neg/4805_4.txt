It was only the second year of the Academy, but they were already voting politically: the brilliant performance of Jeanne Eagels in this talkative screech had to be satisfied with an Oscar and the statue had the worst performance in history: Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE. . The only existing impression was a work impression without music or final editing, but wherever it is displayed, Eagels stuns and captivates with its seductive and powerful performance. She is so convincing on the witness stand that, although we know she lies under her breath (after all WE SEE that she killed the man), in the audience we find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in her innocence, before we suddenly realize. Ourselves. WHAT IS GREAT PERFORMANCE The film must be available on video so that the world can enjoy this excellent performance again. (One of the silent about the existence of Jeanne in the printed file - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so this is the only document we have of her. (when it came out) of the files that will be shown in New York City in the early 70's, Village Voice printed a review of the entire page, loving the performance of the Eagels).
