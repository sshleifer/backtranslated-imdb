What about the French? First, (apparently) they like Jerry Lewis much more than the United States. Second, it seems that they like the work of Edgar Allan Poe more than anyone else. It has to be the "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong ... I'm also a fan of Poe. But this trilogy manages to turn three of Poe's stories below average into ... well, I'm not sure what they're made of. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a good Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of the theme. It is nice at the first display. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with Poe or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big disaster. How were the Vadim films produced? It's just awful ... it's not even up to the standards of an amateur film school. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the segment most faithful to Poe's work. However, it does not have much style, even if it includes the strangest snowball fight, I think I've seen it in a movie. (It seems that the children are throwing handkerchiefs, or perhaps handkerchiefs, which have been rolled into balls). <br /> <br /> My advice is to omit "Metzergenstein", look at "William Wilson", and then, if you're a Fellini fan (I'm not) keep "Toby Dammit" while cooking or preparing a sandwich.
