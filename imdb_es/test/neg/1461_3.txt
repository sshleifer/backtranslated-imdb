The first time I saw "Race Against Fear" (do not you love the titles of LMN movies?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was this going to be serious? Why could not the main character run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was evil just 1 minute after the movie? All these questions, and there are no answers. Then, I just let the inane script and the horrible address drag me ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became more fun per minute, and now I place it among my ten best LMN trash movies. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but that the material was flawed, I strongly disagree. Not only can not convince me that she is an athlete, but her eyes are wide open in the rest of the story, as if she had just landed on earth. Maybe the coach came out of prison and ended with her ... at least I hope so.
