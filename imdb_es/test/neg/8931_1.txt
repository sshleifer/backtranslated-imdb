This is on my TV right now ... but just enough for me to finish seeing it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not improve, no matter how much I hope and pray. I'll agree that this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and it would be your time ... it's not going to get better! I can not believe this writer is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope it has improved a million times! I see some other credits on your resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you're familiar with your work, post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and I'd hate it if this guy turned out to be the crap that turned out to be this movie.
