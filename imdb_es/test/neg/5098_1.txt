Established in the mid-nineteenth century when the British are clearing the New Zealand desert to establish colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori are an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for Europeans. By the time Sarah's son is born, whom she calls "Child," her father is dead. At the age of six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will start looking for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Twice The Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. They also star in: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Morrison Tequila and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and scenes of violent battles. I find that the title RIVER QUEEN is very deceptive and the cover of the DVD only with Sutherland and makes you believe that it is the main star should be a crime.
