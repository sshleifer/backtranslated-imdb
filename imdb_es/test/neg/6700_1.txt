Badland is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Most of the time this is fine and I can continue with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq war, I feel I must say that the story, the plot, the performance, and the description of what the soldiers go through on returning to their homes was pure rubbish. It was as if the director / writer / who clung to any clich√© about returning soldiers, ran with him and ran with him and ran with him ... Not to mention that I guess there was no research in this movie. The "Marine" uniform seemed fresh from a surplus store shelf and was a pattern that had not been used since the first Iraq war. I will not continue forever, this is a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
