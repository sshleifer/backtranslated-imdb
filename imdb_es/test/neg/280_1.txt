Ocean's 12 starts in annoying and gets worse from there. As in a celebrity awards presentation, each actor / main actress performs in short 60-second scenarios that seem to fall short with a "clap now" sign blinking. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disconnected, poorly edited and, at times, unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of history, ... there's one, a little, ... but it's barely visible to all the "look at me" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually "act" during this movie ... the rest of the cast seemed to be there only to participate in a pack rat session. As for the robbery, the action, the drama ... it was included in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and it was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!
