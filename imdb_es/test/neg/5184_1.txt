I really can not think of a good point in this movie. The story is absolutely terrible. The acting is as forceful as a carrot, and the script is so bad that it makes you want to kill yourself. Okay, it's fine if you love it (and you have to love it to understand it) snowboarding you can enjoy it microscopically better, since it has great mountains and some great moves, but other than that it's terrible. He has some absolutely stupid ideas and is racist with both white and black people who insult the races of others. The only time you will laugh is when you laugh at stupidity or feel embarrassed about the movie. I have seen many movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you have this movie, I suggest you take it back to where you bought it and return the money.
