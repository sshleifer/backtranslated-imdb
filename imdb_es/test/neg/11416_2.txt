"Stop smoking while you're ahead" is a phrase they never learn. Typical scenario of the Hollywood sequel: if the first movie was shocking, the second was not, hopes that the third is the worst thing that comes to the screen this year. Even worse are the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you have not seen the first two movies you will not like this one. It's like starting to see The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the latest film in the trilogy. So "independent", this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first movie about the revenge of the Lucians? Do you remember the second about the lost wild brother? Well, if you saw those two moments of 5 minutes and paste them together, would you get? A prequel of 5 min. But the creators thought that these 5 minutes were vital historical events or simply wanted to give a job to some actors, the cast and the team and maybe earn some money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make films to make a living and I get bored, what am I going to do, I know, I'll make a movie." Do you still get this 5 minute prequel and stretch it for 90 minutes? that is this movie And you know what will happen with the main characters "immortal", so there is little suspense. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was that mom had killed at the beginning of the movie. Sick. The rest was the remix of Braveheart. If you want a comedy, go to Braveheart first and then to this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to talk a little? The movie put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire versus werewolf" in the first place? He's older than me and aged just as fast. And why do vampires resemble Goth girls in heat, while werewolves resemble psychopathic bears? The hiding of bad films behind the division fails. Is not it time we had some thin, healthy werewolves with an upright posture? How can their immutable werewolves reproduce if they destroy everyone in pieces? And why with all their powers did vampires not rule the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa ?? What a waste.
