A good and young cast is wasted in this empty, mawkish and manipulative film that tries to be a combination of a beautiful comedy and an insightful drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem to have no end, since the characters do nothing but regret and excite. The dialogue is full of forced clich√©s and biscuit attempts of the fortune of pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> Apparently, with the aim of being a moving and profound look at life and love, the film ends up being simply pretentious. The only real weight is the load that the talented cast is required to carry as best as it can. But, never fear, they are supported by the puppet strings of the artificial plot.
