After a while I realized that it was only my IQ slowly decreasing. Frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where nobody, and I mean nobody, is not even trying. I encouraged the dorky hero to die inside that trash can (how did he manage to fit in there, anyway?), Traci Lords, the queen of the B-movies, was terribly unattractive and ripped me off me and my friends by not showing their tits only once. <br /> <br /> The "characters", although I use that term lightly, are people so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they could have used cardboard cutouts. The "jokes" (I also use this term lightly) are simply hilarious. The fart of a man causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" receives a full acupuncture from Traci Lords. Oh God, I can not breathe! The blind man uses the word F repeatedly! This is too much!!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want about acting, but I thought Adam Grimes did a good job playing a snowboarder with mental problems. Apart from that, the only source of entertainment value here is boobs. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the film, scattered in about five minutes of screen time. That's five minutes worth seeing 83 minutes of garbage without grace. Do not look at this Look at Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson, at least there was a lot of nudity and action in that shoddy movie!
