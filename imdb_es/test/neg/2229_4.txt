Some of my fellow writers have covered the elements of the plot of the film, so I'll stick to some of the comments on the bracelet ... <br /> <br /> 1. This is entertaining, but not for the reasons that you think It's corny, but somehow you can still see it. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. The Christian girl that Dan ignores is much prettier. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole Mr. Spock's shirt. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I'll have to request a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Well ... apparently ... Dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of horrible journey of guilt is that? Muriel says that it was Dan's prayers that kept his parents together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they can stay together is if they decide they are going to do it. <br /> <br /> 5. I will echo the comments of the atheist about how this film portrays non-Christians. Apparently they are all scruffy thugs. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. It gives the film a bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. He practically holds this movie on his own.
