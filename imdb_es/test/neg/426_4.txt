Jeff Speakman never got to surpass the lower ranks of martial artists turned into actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert", you can see why. There are three main problems with this movie: 1) The plot, or should I say, the frames, are everywhere, there are some characters that have a lot of screen time but they serve little, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them without any relation to the main plot and others that take place in the dark, 3) The musical score is too fervent and dominant. Oddly enough, this is really the most annoying thing about this movie: the score tries to convince you that you're watching a kind of big epic, rather than the low-budget limited-action movie you're watching. With all that said, at least there is James Brolin around to give a touch of credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
