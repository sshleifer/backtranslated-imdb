Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really do not know. As for the longer version, it all boils down to the fact that I really like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alice in this. <br /> <br /> Now Tatyana Ali makes a really good effort in this movie? I must say that she is one of the best, and she is emerging as a pretty decent actress. I really want to see it in action, when you have a better material. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie was terrible, and my score is based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen, 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali, and 1 star for not To think that it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse movies for that. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule should stick to rapping, it's not my favorite rapper, to say the least, but some seem to like it, and if it's contained there, I'd love to not see it contaminate the acting scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here? You used to be a great man. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor, who has been in so many terrible and good films, does not have to copy it Ving. <br /> <br /> The rest of the semi-big names in the Cast: it's fine, there are bills to pay, and we all have to do things we're not proud of from time to time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It has such massive flaws that it is quite difficult to know where to start. It's more like a lot of scenes that were thrown together, as the director did to say "we need to say this, and we need to say that." There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising or inside of it. To say the least, the changes in the plot of the story were all too obvious and, therefore, it was predictable what was going to happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To summarize in one word: Really nothing good
