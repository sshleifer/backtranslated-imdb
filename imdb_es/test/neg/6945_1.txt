This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. They said that this was the man's response to Waiting to Exhale ... All I'm going to say is that we really did not respond at all. I could not believe it was really done. The director must choose another profession, because he can not make a film. The script was not good. It did not make sense and it was very messy. The betting movies are much better than they were, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad excuse of a movie. If I could return the hands of time, I would not go back to Media Play to never buy the movie, I would just keep it wrapped in the shelf, instead of wasting time looking at it.
