If this movie was made two years earlier, it could have been much better. But unfortunately, it was made in the decade that I had no idea how a horror movie looked or acted. When I first heard about this movie, the people in IMDb classified it as the sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how wrong they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was in that, but Uma Thurman sure was not. I would really like to find the person who started all that rumor sequel. I'm sure many of us would. I'm not going to reveal anything because, frankly, I do not remember how this movie ends! I'll just tell you to watch a real horror movie from the camp ... The Burning, starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the geek from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. A word for the wise: just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title does not mean it's worth seeing. Oh, and another thing, ANY FLICK OF HORROR MADE AT THE INITIATION IN THE MID-90'S, WAS CONSIDERED TO VEIL!
