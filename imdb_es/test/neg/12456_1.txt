I'm not even going to waste any more time describing how bad this movie is. In short: he acted horribly, had huge holes in the plot and left absolutely NOW. The only good thing about this was the description that my digital cable gave for the movie: "A married man with a business with problems has an affair with his secretary". Eh ?? Apparently, an incorrect film, although it could have made things a little more interesting if any of the descriptions were true. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
