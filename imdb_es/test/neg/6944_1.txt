This is by far the worst movie I've seen in Bollywood this year. I may not lie, my wife really liked this movie. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal that made this movie incredible, but Amisha Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman who gets into trouble when she almost falls off a mountain where (fortunately for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). Here I am surprised how a blind girl is aware of the danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she can not see her surroundings. From this scene I began to see the film very closely and in each scene there was a flaw in the performance of Amisha Patel. The way he plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way he does it is not to look into the eyes of the person he is talking to. When I saw this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with his performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level by acting as an actress. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's the story of the clich√©. Suddenly, Arjun is killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is desperate, but Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor from my point of view, but he can not take the film to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep into the ground. I must say that Bobby deserves better roles in better films than he has achieved so far. Bobby grew up acting from the first movie his adorable dad gave him. It was so bad acting in Barsaat, but when you see him act now, you shudder and believe every word he says. Only a film with a high potential like a Yash Copra movie has to find its way. <br /> <br /> Well, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, someone enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this shit? I do not. Why did not they give their role to one of the ugly kids in the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and gave Bobby a role in one of the biggest blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a shout for an actor like Bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) Patel. This movie was so horrible, that I regret having bought it.
