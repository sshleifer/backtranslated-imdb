My friends and I rented this movie confusing it with another about skateboarding. Watching Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is very funny. The film is so incredibly predictable and exaggerated that it ended up being a festival of laughter. Even though I gave it a 1/10, this movie should be seen, especially if you manage to capture it on TV anywhere.
