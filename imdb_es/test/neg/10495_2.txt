I give this movie Vampire Assassins a rating of "2" mainly because I did not have sex or nudity. Apart from that, I'm not sure why it was made. It was more like a training exercise on how to make a movie with a very limited budget. The Derek and Slovak characters were the best actors. They were followed closely by the "biker-dude" with the pleather pants and the silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the movie was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse. If you got tired of seeing the stunts of kung fu boxing, you can see Scott's packages, Windex and other cleaning products. You'll have plenty of time to do this, trust me. I almost started making a list. The dialogue and the kung-fu acrobatics were extremely slow. They spoke slowly, they fought slowly, etc. I do not know why. At least with the extra slow delivery of the lines of actors, you could hear everything very clearly. I'm trying to find good things to say about this movie. We saw it until the end to see if it improved, but it was not like that. We could never decide if the actors really knew the martial arts or simply acted as if they knew martial arts. You can look at yourself and decide. My favorite line was something like (vampire speaking :) "What are you looking at?" Another man responding: "your bad dental work".
