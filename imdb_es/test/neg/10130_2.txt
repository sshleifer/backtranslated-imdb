This is what the Disney Channel shows to children who are more foolish than messages. It suits them well. It's not fun, acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and everything in this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. You want to know why? This is not only a waste of time in the air, but the main "actress", Selena Gomez, looks like a pig. The character of Jake T. Austin needs some Ritalin. The character of David Henrie needs to visit a strip club and be wasted. In addition, the writer of the show is inconsistent. In one episode, the security guard is called "sir" by a character and is called a woman for everything else. <br /> <br /> Hello? It's called correction and editing. Do it ever, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promotion of the new "saga of bloodsuckers in four parts"? Disney wanted his own version of Twilight vs. Harry Potter. Except a million times lick. The Wizards of Waverly Place Movie? Think about it for a minute. The family goes on vacation and their 16-year-old daughter wants independence from her parents. The same plot of The Proud Family Movie, etc ... <br /> <br /> What is worse is all that Emmies and ALMA got. And most of the audience is between 4 and 13 years old (and there are no teenagers in life). how many more years before Selena Gomez shows her tits? <br /> <br /> and the Disney shows are all garbage ... hacking writers ... hacking shows ... destroying the minds and wallets of today's young people ...
