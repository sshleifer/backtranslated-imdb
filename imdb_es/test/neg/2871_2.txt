I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time, I like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more. I think a lot of that was really stupid and I had no argument to be a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie, but anyone who likes live the bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he's a much better actor than most of Haggard's people and he probably could have made this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and he should have had more bam skating.
