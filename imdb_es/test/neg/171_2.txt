Oh God! It could be a very interesting movie and in fact it is. I would have liked to give it a 5 but I give it a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really POOR !!!!! It's still shaking all the time, in a completely unflavored frame! <br /> <br /> It is really painful to see this movie so interesting in a movie theater. He gets dizzy quickly and has to make a big effort not to throw up in his neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame because the story is edited non-linearly, which is quite rare (and a very good idea) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Look at this at home!
