This started as a good sketch comedy. The first shows were very good and I expected a long journey. What was really fun was the imitation of Mariah Carey and the takeoff of Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair fight. The heavyweight battle Delta Burke vs. William Conrad was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows were downhill relatively fast. The writing became uninspired and as predictable as if the show had acquired a cult in its youth. Nothing new was offered and the recurrent parodies were boring. An example is the family of weapons (or whatever it is called) that became a weekly feature. This sketch was not so fun to start with, let alone be a regular feature. An example of a fast promising start and then a sudden fall.
