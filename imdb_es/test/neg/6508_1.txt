Maybe it was the excessive weight gain that Seagal had put on. Or maybe it was the awful Wayans performance in an action movie. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to the conclusion that Seagal should never have made this nightmare of action. It is true that the story was good. However, as an avid follower of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his clean, pure and healthy Zen Buddhist lifestyle, especially in his on-screen conversations with Wayans. (Then, again, his real life adventure with the "babysitter" was also inconsistent!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what another action figure does. in "Kindergarten Cop" ... put material or comical situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. Otherwise, leave the wise cracks and useless attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer. Seagal is not a kind of natural humor. It did not work <br /> <br />
