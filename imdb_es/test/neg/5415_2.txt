This movie tries to scam Predator, but that movie is much better. This movie has really terrible special effects and a meaningless plot. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientists is a combo of male delta commandos, tough and robust, and pretty but tough women. None of them is too bright. All the characters seem more than willing to run into the woods alone and head towards a spear or sword and his death. Some of the pyrotechnic products are very large and must have cost a package. But the creature's close-ups are ridiculous, as are most death scenes. All the clich√©s writers could think of were used. If you are looking for a festival of mindless killings, this can fill the bill. The night I saw this was very slow, so I sat through the whole thing. I have to admit that it's been a while since I saw something so bad. There is very little to redeem this movie. I'm surprised that garbage like this occurs.
