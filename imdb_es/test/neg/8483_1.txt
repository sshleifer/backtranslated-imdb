Loki, the Nordic god of mischief, creates a mask that gives the bearer the power of cartoons. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the film looking for the mask so that it can not cause more pain to humanity. Meanwhile, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc etc. If this sounds like a very thin plot, it is. Add to this the fact that the film is handled ineptly from beginning to end, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you will have to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a preschool, but in the light of scenes like the baby's mask urinating copiously in six different directions, including his father, this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought could have been the target audience for the film, and he answered "condemned convicts", apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. <br /> <br /> a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would overflow. What makes it a sin is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of trash. To put things in perspective, the day after we saw the Son in the mask, my son and I saw "Good night and good luck", a film that won six nominations for the academy awards (including the best photo) and that was done for $ 7. million. It's okay. Only one-tenth of the amount of money spent on Son of the Mask. This, then, is the sin: throwing good money down the sewer, when it could have been better used to make movies to watch, feed hungry children or, for that matter, almost any other purpose. The producers really should be ashamed of themselves.
