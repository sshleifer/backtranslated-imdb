I must admit, I love horror movies ... especially 80's movies. Hell, I even love cheeses like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But, I did not think much about this movie. The scenes of death were not very well done, the CGI was terrible and the performance was boring. Worst of all was the story that did not make sense at all. I would say save money, but most likely, if you want to see this movie ... anyway, do it. I did not hate it ... it's not very good. In general, it's just another insipid and lifeless horror movie that has no life (no wonder it's been on Dimension's shelf for more than a year after it was completed).
