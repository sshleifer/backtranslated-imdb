The website of the satirical movie Dateline Hollywood jokingly said that "Son of the Mask" was a prank-starring practice that Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment." If only. And if only the movie had been half as funny as that piece of satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for the attractive Jim Carrey that so many spectators write; He also loved men over 12 years old when introducing Cameron Diaz. Therefore, having less follow up to both was not a good idea, plus you would have thought that New Line would have learned the lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd". But no ... although to be fair, having a brand new cast is in harmony with the original comic book (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). However, as Lance Khazei wrote and was directed by Lawrence Guterman, there is nothing in return, except a steady stream of FX certainly decent by the usual squad of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improve in the dance of "Ally McBeal" "and in its own" Baby's Day Out ", with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension, etc., and even more support for the cartoon fans by having our hero work in an animation company (responsible of gems like "Siamese Popes"), naming his character as Tex Avery and working not only on references to classic cartoons but on real clips. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the last approach does not really work, partly because most of the attempts to bring the cartoon ornaments for live action are nothing special (especially the cars that enter the party environment) and mainly because the tributes to the Flintstones , Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits in the shambolic sambhicle along with the tense feeling (the underlying theme of the story is the family, our hero is not ready to have a child, and his nemesis, Alan Cumming as the Nordic god Loki) is far from the apple of Odin Eye ... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros." it's out of my reach, and Kennedy is simply not in the same league as Carrey in the bizarre bets, though it's not as if he gets any help from the script. Also keep in mind that unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (like the mother of the mask's son) does not have much to do; Giving LA the mask could have helped the movie. <br /> <br /> More points are lost for discarding Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated runtime (which would account for some plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt to make an internal joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of "green boy" as an animated television series, "The Mask" became a live television animated series, and was a better follow-up until this sequel. The fact that this was opened in Britain before the United States should tell you everything ... with this and with "Blade: Trinity", New Line seems determined to corner the market in terrible aftermath with cast members of "Two Guys And A Girl. " "What's next," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone to stop this.
