This show is terrible. I can not overcome the total loss of great talent that this show contains. This is not an entertaining improvisational performance, it's just a cheap attempt to throw a famous comic actor onto a stage and have him present a badly improved scene. I have really done an improvisation job as an actor, and this show is not improvisation. <br /> <br /> What the audience really is laughing at (if they really laugh at this show, it seems pretty fake) is the shame of the guest star lost like a deer in the headlights. The silly and unrelated things they do are the things that people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell you it's wrong! I find that this show is a disgrace to art and makes me cry for programs like Whose Line is it Anyway, which had great talent, great improvisational games and, above all, it did not make me want to change the channel.
