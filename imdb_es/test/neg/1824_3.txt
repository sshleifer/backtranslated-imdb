On a mission in picturesque Italy, the beautiful Lana Turner (as Fredda Barlo) meets the singer and Prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love, while enjoying the beautiful Italian countryside. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza is called to the death bed of his father Kingly, leaving Lana in the lurch. Twelve years later, Ms. Turner is an actress from Los Angeles, about to make a movie about how to fall in love with a King. Turner is being rompeded by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her. So, King Pinza comes back into his life? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Imperium" provides a tired story for the sex symbol Turner and debutant vocalist Pinza, who appeared for several decades with the Metropolitan Opera of New York. It is likely that Pinza won his MGM film career after appearing in the highly successful stage production of "South Pacific" (1949). The album of the cast and the gold single of "Some nights enchanted" of Pinza, sold millions. Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
