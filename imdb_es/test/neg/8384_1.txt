It seems that I can not find anything good from this miniseries. Why the hell would you ban chocolate when you could ban something much more practical, like smoking or drinking alcohol? Also, the fact that it is an Australian program and everything is set in England and that everyone is imitating British accents is stupid. In general I think that this show is unrealistic and cheap.
