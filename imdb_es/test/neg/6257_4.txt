"Based on a joke that Jim Wynorski said" ... that's what I read at the end of the final credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must have a tremendous sense of humor then! This movie is terrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of the series The Slumber Party Massacre; The third movie was pretty useless, but completely visible, compared to this shit! There is not even a killer killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reasons to see this turkey are the girls: if this movie were a porno, I think it would have worked much better! The film also lacks blood: the first scene (the one in the store) could be more bloody and the scene with the headless boy who knocked on the door lasted a second! Some moments of slight emotion can not save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him as the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there's a pointless part with Brinke Stevens, who played "Linda" in the first Slumber Party Massacre: the police bother to know more details about the killer; But what we get is just some images from the first movie! Neither a dialogue, nor a monologue, nor anything about this girl still traumatized, who is forced to relive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), without giving us any clue about the murderer! <Br /> <br /> View at your own risk.
