Most people have the luxury of writing the title of a movie and getting to know the movie before seeing it, but unfortunately, I've never been one of those people. I would not even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to that because if you ignore those warnings and even give a movie a shot after it has collapsed in theaters, enter at your own risk and you could end up a bad taste in my mouth that is exactly what I feel about this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of their songs (and they seriously exclude the title track). Even the always promising talent of Kangana Renaut (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here when she plays Ruhi, the woman who has captured the attention of the main male characters played by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ, a producer of music without roots). and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses the path of AJ). Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH required from a social partner that is abandoned by Reggi (whom she helped put her foot on the door of the record industry). This does not sound like a mix or movie that should include Anupam Kher, right? Well, you're wrong because he's in that as Reggi's father (another lost talent). <br /> <br /> The movie might not have been so bad if they had not killed the writing behind Deol's character. The moral message was too predicative (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the ending was too exaggerated to make you wonder why you sat before such a silly movie in the first place. In truth, this is the epitome of shit.
