On the scale of 1 to 10, I gave this one a 4. I thought that the movie was not very good, with too much violence and without a single character that I liked. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale, I give this to 6. Many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. I always enjoy nudity, and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant appear, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
