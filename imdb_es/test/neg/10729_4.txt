Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) end up in the line of unemployment when the company for which Dick works is caught in a corruption scandal, and after trying to look for work in a desperate and unsuccessful way, the duo resorts to to the crime to get it. out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been a while since he made a direct comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty, which was pretty good. He has shown that he can make serious dramas, but comedy is his real element. The fun with Dick and Jane shows that he still has it. Even though the movie was fun, it was still a bit disappointing. It was not as fun as I thought it would be. It's worth seeing once, although unlike most Carrey movies, it does not have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak since this is the same guy who did The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes are simply discouraged and other times they seem to be trying too much. If Jim Carrey were not in it, the movie would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She is a good actress, but she is not very funny. She does not agree well with Carrey and seemed to be calling on the phone in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and actually gives a decent performance. It was not as annoying as most children's stars. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm a bit biased here. The film in general was quite normal, but I liked it more because of the performance of Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey fans should enjoy it but that's it. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
