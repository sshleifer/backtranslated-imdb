I saw this on the cable. Someone had to lose his job to give this green light to the air. The fact that a film is made does not mean that it should be shown! The wild instinct must be shown in ALL kinds of movies. It's the perfect template for not making a movie. The issue alone is so upset that you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (bad) monkeys, traveling through the unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The audio is often not readable. Interim? I can not call anything of what I saw here acting. Reciting? Hmmm I can not call it that either. Default? That works. All this said ... IT IS HILARO! I can not emphasize enough that there is not a single factor that can be traded in this "movie" apart from the hilarity derived from its own incredible ineptitude. Fun, in a strictly masochistic way. Look at it ... if you dare.
