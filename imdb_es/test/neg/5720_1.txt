I remember the trailer of this famous and weak spin-off of Conan. I watched the movie years later and I laughed. Unintentionally! Poor Briggite Nielson. His career never had an opportunity thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is as follows: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of warriors who were killed by an evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb that the warriors protected and uses to destroy each city through which it passes. Sonja goes in search of Queen Gedren and later discovers that Gedren killed her parents. In his search, he reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his clumsy idiot servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they will hunt down Queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are bland. I mean, Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who lost her entire family, as well as her classmates, Sonja does not seem at all embarrassed. Arnold is playing his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr ... what an annoying and annoying brat he was in this movie! The bad-tempered Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the film, although sometimes they are not so good. The scene in which they fight against the mechanical marine creature made me laugh until my ribs hurt. The dialogue is also a hoot. It's as if the scriptwriter thought no one was going to take the movie seriously, so he gave everyone stupid lines to work on. I can only recommend this movie if you like your most extravagant epic movies. Anyone who does not bother.
