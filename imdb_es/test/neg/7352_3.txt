This could have been a good movie if more things were explained. Too many plot holes to find this nice. The final in particular is outside the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper return to Dundee so quickly and Dundee appears in the house in two minutes? Far away from here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation at all. If Pete, the policeman knew Lancaster was in danger, why did not he have a cop at the hospital door? This and many more questions remain. Pity because the premise was there, only bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> A good deal is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? The character of Lancaster lacks development and Dureya is simply blah as the "bad boy". <br /> <br /> This could be remade with a story of cohesion and better writing. Of course I would be much more violent with lots of free sex and everything. I guess the edition would also be uneven, so let's leave it pretty good.
