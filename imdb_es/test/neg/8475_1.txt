This "film", and I use that term lightly, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: "U., stupid poopies!" <br /> <br /> Like that joke, this movie can only attract the very young, the very immature or the very stupid. <br /> <br /> That said, there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects, to which most of the reputed $ 100 million were allocated, are kinetic and convincing; that is, as convincing as the kinetic CGI effects can be. The CGI effects for babies are not very good, but I imagine it is very difficult to do well ... although for a hundred million dollars, they could have been better! <br /> <br /> Moose, the dog of "Frasier," telephoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but nice. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Mrs. Avery was as pretty as a button, as expected, and Jamie Kennedy stank, as expected. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, it's not. <br /> <br /> The writing and the direction were, in any case, worse than Kennedy's performance. I half remember an intelligent line (although intelligent for seven years) that I wish someone would quote accurately for the section "Memorable phrases". Something about the disguise proposed by Avery is the "most horrible craptown crap", it was a second degree joke, but something funny in its context. <br /> <br /> Above all, since there is nothing lower than a "one". I give this movie a "one".
