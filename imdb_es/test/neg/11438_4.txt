This movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay in a house to get money by renovating it and then discover that the house has a Deamon woman in it and that there is a portal to hell. In this movie there are lots of stupid scenes like at the beginning of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start dancing a corny song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in costumes who try to make scary sounds and there are some good bloody scenes, like when the Professor breaks his face. I only hired this movie because I'm a big fan of horror movies and it's only worth watching if you're a horror movie fan. The acting in this movie is really bad, the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the great movie Jaws and, above all, this movie has many flaws and my score is 4 out of 10.
