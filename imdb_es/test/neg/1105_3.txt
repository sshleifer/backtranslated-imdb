I really wanted like this movie. A movie with zombie children coming out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film was at the bottom of the 3 horror fest films. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters try to move on after their husband / father died of an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. They end up fighting because of the whole environment for different reasons. (The children of Zrazy Zombie fall into this category) The film never gives any sentimental bond to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not produce fear or skip valuable moments, the film just shows Children doing what they are supposed to do. .. Kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast, this movie could have hope. Until then, pass it on. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 actually.
