Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not just about being beautiful on the outside. The interior counts for something too. Many of the past winners have seemed semi decent, but they are horribly cruel and are beginning to give problems to the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in each season. The only thing that is worth seeing Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-operative transsexual. I felt that I should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy that was shown through her feminine appearance. Tyra should have given her advice or maybe she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl. Instead, the participant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive reviews. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model really needs a lot of renovation and a little more humanity.
