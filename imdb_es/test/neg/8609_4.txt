I saw the world premiere of this in the Starz action channel. They call it vampires: the turn. The plot was a bit confusing. There is a voiceover in the introduction about an 800-year war, and I did not fully understand it. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I do not think the movie specifies). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe escapes and is kidnapped by a gang of biker vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires that do not kill humans, and enters a battle with the motorcyclists. A human group of murderers is somehow involved, and the final sequence of struggle takes place during a solar eclipse. This movie is not related to Vampires or Vampires: The Dead. Confusing, but decent action. Four out of 10 stars.
