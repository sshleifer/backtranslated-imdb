This has to be the worst show I've ever seen. I always liked Chuck Norris in movies, but why do we need to make these programs politically correct by adding a black sidekick that is as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker? I also thought that the program was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African-American who looks like this Trivette guy and they kick his butt once a week. It's all attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the congratulations he receives, I think this show started very well but lost strength as time went by <br /> <br /> They should have thrown the side kick of Chucks
