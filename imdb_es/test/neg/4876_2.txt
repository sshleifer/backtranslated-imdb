This film presents several well-known actors that I generally like, so I had at least modest expectations when I rented this on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I went to have some sandwiches somewhere for the last half hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen instead of going back to the television. The performances of the actors where they were poor practically in all areas and none of the environments in the film felt very convincing. Virtually every scene had that "just a movie" feeling to them, I just sat there waiting for the director to call "CUT!" followed by the team that has a small talk about the scene before moving on to the next. <br /> <br /> As the film is about gang members, most of the characters are difficult and similar to the mafia, the problem here is that all this is bad - the child's attitude is played so badly that it feels like a joke. The constant drilling soundtrack of the guitar also tries to emphasize this atmosphere, but when the same song is played the 18th time, it adds to the already strong feeling that everything is false. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just a really bad script, maybe it was badly executed. I'm not a film critic, in fact, I think it's weird to see something that's really good, but this was just bad, no matter how objective and forgiving it is trying to be. NOT recommended, not even as a rental!
