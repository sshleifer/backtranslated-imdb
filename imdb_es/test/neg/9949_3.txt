As I sit and think about Poison for the Fairies, I realize that it may not be fair to the movie. My 3/10 rating may have more to do with my disappointment with the movie than with its quality or real entertainment value. Based on the description of the plot, the reviews in IMDb and the IMDb classification of 7.6, I would make sure that I had run into a little known gem. Unfortunately, he simply did not do much for me. For whatever reason, Poison for the Fairies almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison for the Fairies is the story of two girls in 1965 in Mexico City. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her. That is really about that. Actually, it does not happen very much and the film is prolonged again and again when Veronica tries to terrorize and dominate Flavia. A commentator on IMDb described it as "the most terrifying movie in the Mexican cinema of the 80s." My comment ?? If that is the case, there must not have been many horror films made in Mexico in the 80s. Another commentator wrote: "Look at it if you want to scare". My comment ?? Are we sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples that I have given. For me, it was boring, uninspired and badly performed. The framing of the scene is especially annoying since the director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia have long extended conversations with family members and their teacher, but we never really see the faces of these people. It's an annoying trick.
