The sometimes memorable dialogue of Scenarist Frederick Fox and a cast of old professionals can not save this warm western over targets trapped in the desert by a band of Cheyenne Indians thirsty for blood. Apart from its occasionally catchy dialogue, you will not find any surprise in Fox's script about this meeting between whites and Indians. The characters in "Dakota Incident" generate only a minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand out as much as some of Fox's dialogues. Unfortunately, good dialogue is Fox's only contribution because this conventional little freak withers with a dull finish that contradicts its previous 80 minutes. The ending is as artificial as they come and lacks credibility. Most of the characters are nice, but some simply lack common sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is appropriately strong and corpulent, like the outcast John Banner, one of the three bank robbers who has to shoot with his low profile. Down, partners without an account. Veteran Western character actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) feels like the best of bad men, while Skip Homeier, wasted in an inconsequential role as Banner's brother, Frank Banner, later dies of an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to shoot Banner at the beginning of the action, but our armed left-handed hero fakes his own death, tracks Largo later and hits the leather with him in a town called Christian Flats. Naturally, Largo stings the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers on a stagecoach from Christian Flats to Laramie turns out to be nothing less than the bank teller from whom he stole the money. John Carter (John Lund) is not only on a search to find Banner, but also wants to clean his own good name with the bank that has issued placards for his arrest. Evidently, the authorities have confused and expanded Carter's role in the theft. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and turn him in to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he meets Amy Clarke (the former beauty of Twentieth Century Fox, Linda Darnell), who wears a bright red dress and still has a large breast. As everyone else here mentioned in their comments, Republic Studio's Truecolor draws RED on everything from Darnell's outfit to blood spilled on the floor. The problem with director Lewis Foster's handling of this passing oater is that everything gets stuck after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hide in a dry wash to defend themselves against the Cheyenne. The good guys and the Cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" never runs out of clich√©s. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the path of red skin. By the time this 88 minute powder lifter finishes, you'll feel like you're trapped in a ravine and threatened by marauding Cheyenne.
