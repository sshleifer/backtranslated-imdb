This was included in the album "Shorts: Volume 2", a rather boring collection of short films. The shorts are among my favorite movie style, but somehow the people who assembled this second collection had difficulty finding quality content, and it was not as good as the first volume or other collections of short films. <br /> <br /> This short film feels like woefully incomplete. There is a story, but no answer, that the viewer, like me, feels a little excluded. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (which is a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that, at times, is a bit difficult to follow. Since I have hearing problems, I would have loved it if I had been subtitled. Anyway, the groom goes swimming while she sleeps. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. She panics and makes the boy follow everything about looking for the dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being unpleasant. Then, out of nowhere, they stop having sex. Later, they find the end of the story. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, they both seemed rather dysfunctional and unpleasant. She was a demanding and demanding woman and he seemed to despise her. When you asked yourself why they were together, their little sexual pause showed what bond kept them together. <br /> <br /> Some may like the characterizations: I kept finding the people irritating and unreal, more like cartoons than people you could meet or know. Also, the reward for all this is simply not worth waiting for (unless you want to see the naked man).
