After watching Avalon (which was only decent due to the very good digital fx) and several anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic), I decided that I should see the Oshii movie trilogy set. Since the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment here on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent in a long time. The first time I saw Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. It saddens me to say that these films are possibly the two most boring movies I've ever seen. For only about 10 minutes in each movie, you can see some action between the characters, who are only dressed in the "Panzer Cop" outfit for some fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very strange scenes full of boring dialogues in less than impressive places. I do not really understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the costumes of the Wolf's Brigade and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT to watch these movies, and I certainly do not buy the box as I did, unless I enjoy the waste of money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think of the third movie on the set, Talking Head, I did not even dare to see it before removing the package from my DVD collection through eBay with a loss of $ 20. If you want action Japanese live, check out Returner, or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
