You already know the story of "Sweeney Todd", probably thanks to Tim Burton's recent movie. You probably do not know, however, of this version of the old story by Andy Milligan, the famous seedy merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. <br /> <br /> It had to happen with time In my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s, I'm finally reviewing a movie by Andy Milligan. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us a lot of horror movies and exploitation, none of which was good, and you could hardly see it. "Bloodthirsty butchers" are no exception. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue and, well, it is spoken, and that is one of the things you will find here: lots and lots of conversation. The film reaches almost the levels of "Hands of Destiny Hands" sometimes, while you wait tirelessly for something to happen. Although I love the cheap gore effects, violence is very scarce and, despite its reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love the cheap and sordid exploitation as much as the next devotee of garbage cinema, but "Bloodchirsty Butchers" is the kind of evil that MST3K tears ruthlessly. Unfortunately, Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991, and if there were any movie of his that I would say I'd like, it would be the delirious "The Ghastly Ones." Although this is not "Ghosts", it's just bad.
