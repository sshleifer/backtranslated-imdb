Please, do not waste your money on this excuse apology for a movie. The only way I could see someone watching this is if they are fans of Erika Elaniak, but it would be better to surf the Internet than watching this garbage. I prefer to see the dry paint than to see this. <br /> <br /> They attract you with Casper and Erika and lead you to believe it's a Dracula science fiction movie, but it quickly becomes a farce about the genius of Van Helsing (you understand the point) grandson, here , ironically, for a final confrontation between him and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The movie also tries to make a political statement, I think, when it seems that none of the characters in the future knows who God is that they have not been taught about him and do not understand when they see a cross. I could have done a lot more with this idea. It's a pity that it came out the way it did.
