This was a very good show. I enjoyed the real-time construction and flashback, seeing the old Diggers meet again and remember the terrors of their captivity in the Changi prison camp. The main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a holiday camp than the place should have been. I'm old enough to remember movie images of the men who were freed from Changi and other Japanese prisoner of war camps. No actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance to the state of those men. They made the Jews of Belsen look like sumo wrestlers. I have met several Changi veterans over the years. Many will never travel in a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and mental torture these men endured was too horrible for them to even talk about. What percentage survived? John Doyle might be fine writing a comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate that too), but this is a serious sugarcane story that should never have been tolerated. I'm glad that the satirists write "Brian's Life" and make fun of the Crucifixion because it's obviously a comedy, even if some people consider it to be in bad taste. "Changi" is written as a representation of a real event and, as such, could be considered by young people as a true record. The great performances of a fine cast can not redeem this light script.
