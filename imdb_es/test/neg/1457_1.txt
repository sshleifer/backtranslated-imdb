This is a movie that has gained any interest or praise that it has received simply for the merit of being a piece of lesbian interest. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to the best movies in the GLBT interest genre. The entire visible value of the film is obtained through a modest hold over whether the family members of the couple will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship and when. The best element of the film is probably the beautiful landscape of New England, although much of the film is set inside. It's hard to imagine how any viewer who watches this movie and does not seek affirmation of their GLBT lifestyle or wanting to see the affirmation of others, even through a poorly done drama, could appreciate Treading Water in a meaningful way. It is a terrible movie.
