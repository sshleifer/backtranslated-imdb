This was intolerable. (SPOILER # 1) The protagonists avoid the useless revelation of agonizing truths to their loved ones, lest they renounce this state and assume the roles of the antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) The writers would make us believe that the exposition of multiple transgressions, on the part of the transgressor, represents a threat and provokes a retaliatory response on the part of the main victim of the transgressions. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes, I anticipated a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; instead, it was like discovering that Lieutenant Columbo's dog is the REAL murderer. The story was not credible, and I do not think the best director in the world could have saved it without a massive edition.
