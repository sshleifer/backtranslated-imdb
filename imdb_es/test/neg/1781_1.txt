Even by the standards of most B-movies, this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster costume looks more realistic. The effects of ocean water are especially ridiculous, including the only scene in which they tackle the mini-sub, and the "water" seems to be frozen instead. The problems with this movie are so numerous that I will simply stop here with the details. Needless to say, I do not joke when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other B-grade movies that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
