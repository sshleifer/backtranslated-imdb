S l o w, l o n g, d u l l. . . <br /> <br /> Oh my God, bored. <br /> <br /> So annoying characters, you'll shudder every time you see Jimy Smits, or the boy who played TomTom from now on. They should never have rehearsed or checked the movie in progress. Mel Gibson was absolutely wooden. <br /> <br /> This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it was almost directly to the video, it says it's very close. <br /> <br />
