Ok, I wanted to see this because I had some good reviews, but this movie was horrible ... Just horrible. The characters were one-dimensional and nothing the actors could do could give them life. The story was abysmal ... The wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway ... It just completely forgotten. The visuals, although they were great, were incredibly long ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the floor, 3 minutes of a girl putting on makeup. I do not know what this guy is trying to achieve ... it's as if he had no plot or dialogue and the film needed to run so long, so we do not edit scenes ... Foreign films are great for creating an unused dialogue, this movie makes me think that there is no way that American cinema can do this. I want to stop watching movies completely ... Bad bad movie!
