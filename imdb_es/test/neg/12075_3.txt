Wow, this episode started on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise is moving forward when suddenly, Abraham Lincoln is floating in space and welcomes the Enterprise! Is it just me, or is it a really awkward idea? Lincoln gets on board and welcome them. Abe suggests that they move to some arid planet, where they meet other famous dead people, both good and bad. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has brought together a team of GOOD and MALA people to fight for supremacy. The whole thing seems really dazzling and intrinsically unfair, since the GOOD side is saddled with Surak, a Vulcan who makes Gandhi look like Rambo! Despite a totally INCREDIBLE premise, the action is quite good and it is great to see shots from above of obvious double fighting in this fight of resentment. But, do not confuse this with art or deep science fiction. The conclusion is that the series was in its last stages as a series of first race and this really seemed that they sprinkled this turkey and filmed it despite the absurdity of the premise.
