Take the insanity of the secret agent / James Bond of the sixties, mix some concepts of Fu Manchu femme fatale of Sax Rohmer and add an absurd twisted revisionism of the director Franco: you have the lesbian Sumuru that hates the men or "The 7 secrets of ... ", better known as" The Girl From Rio "in the USA. UU., Remembering "That Man From Rio", which has nothing to do with this. Yes, this takes place in Brazil, you have to give it that. Sumuru, or Sumitra, as it is also known, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise", played here by the actress Eaton with that shy and familiar smile that most of us met in "Goldfinger". There are numerous shots in the foreground of her fixed camera, which slowly opens her mouth, probably while observing something unpleasant (however, she has doubled in her key lesbian scene). She controls an entire army of warrior women, dressed in colors, and governs a city called Femina or something like that (outside of Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which appeared earlier in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru", sound great, but, despite some intriguing visuals and designs, they follow the same pitched atmosphere of, for example, the very old-fashioned "Some Girls Do," which It arrived at about the same time and it also had a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, generally aligned in a row, captures the interest, but after about 15 minutes, you realize that there is nothing beyond configuring the visual. <br /> <br /> The plot follows what appears to be a secret agent, a man, who arrives in Brazil with 10 million dollars. It attracts the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, who criticizes him as a Bond-type villain), who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to face him. This prepares everything for a three-way conflict between the agent, the lord of the crime and the mysterious Sumuru (the lord of the crime wants the secrets of Sumuru). Sumuru also keeps several prisoners in glass cages, maybe that's one of the secrets. This sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace; there are many shots that could have used a lot of trouble: a shot of an arriving plane, for example, remains in the ship when it stops, as if it had never been captured in the film before. There is an approach similar to a typical sunset, as if there was something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very deficient, as if the filmmakers had to use the first shots. To add some production value, there is a scene of the true carnival of Rio halfway. I suppose there were several budgetary problems, especially evident in the climatic battle, where the false sound and smoke effects cover a lot of false actions, such as the lack of real-looking pistols; use plastic guns and simulate that the bullets are being fired, falling unconvincingly. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early description of them after some restrictions were lifted. But, above all, you will be rolling your eyes. Hero: 3 Villains: 5 Fatal Women: 5 Henchmen: 4 Fights: 3 Cheats / Persecutions: 3 Gadgets: 4 Auto: 4 Locations: 6 Rhythm: 3 Overall: 4
