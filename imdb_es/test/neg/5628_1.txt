Famous for being so bad the British film that had to be given away for free with a newspaper, the quality of this "thriller" of the Children's Sub-Film Film can be deduced by the abnormal number of 10/10 votes it receives and the large number of favorable comments from posters with no publication history and no other comments in their name. The regulars know what this means, the gullible could be scammed. If they dive into the waters of this, they will not last long before they are dragged. Technically inept with the boom of the microphone when firing or the reflections of the visible crew, it simply continues forever in a forgetful SUB-DAVINCI CODE of $ 5 per day. The ending is only insulting but do not worry. It's not like you get that far!
