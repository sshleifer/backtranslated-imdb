The producers of the film hope that the name of Cameron DÃ­az will help sell this film. Unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some beautifully shot European locations and some solid production design elements, the film fails mainly because of its uncomfortable and incredible romance between Brewster and Eccleston. A cinematic experience without complications.
