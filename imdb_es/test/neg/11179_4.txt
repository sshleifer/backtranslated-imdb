Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a steel factory in Pittsburgh who works to recruit workers in the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family and neighbors. What makes it even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a communist to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike in the mill, so the pro-strike movement will take the workers to a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to deal with the beautiful Eve Merrick, member of the party and teacher at her son's school, who realizes that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve finds out the horrible truth about the real motives of the match, the reds decide that it must be liquidated and Cvetic must help her without putting herself in danger. The film must have a lot of suspense and double crossing, but there is very little in this movie but (by today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or emotion. Lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem apathetic. Few surprises here and how did this film receive an Oscar nominated for the best documentary? Score, 4
