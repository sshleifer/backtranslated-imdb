Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are well below the level, even if they were in a playstation 1, it does not matter a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the movements of the camera disorient. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I love Warner's Batman animation and it's great that they do all the games this way. Batman: Vengeance could have turned out very well since they got off to a good start by keeping all the Gothic images and voice actors, but they were seriously tripped up when it came to gameplay and graphics. The result is a boring game that seems incredibly cheap and is not fun to play at all. I really must underline how bad the graphics are. Do not let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better things in a Commodore 64.
