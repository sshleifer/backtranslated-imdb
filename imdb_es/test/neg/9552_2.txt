I just saw this early in the morning on the Fox channel by accident (my dog ​​woke me up). He had seen it for years and thought he remembered it quite well. As a child he had enjoyed it. But now? As another poster commented, several of the reels were out of service, and although at the beginning he was disoriented and strange, he seemed to fit into the production; what was horrible became surreal and funny. Musical numbers for what I think was the "big" fundraising event ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most children are in show business, we're going to do a show ") out of nowhere BEFORE all there is talk of putting on a show and then disappearing without applause to the" direct "scenes totally unrelated. The main man's girlfriend appears, spits lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half awake, and I loved every minute of madness.
