This movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. There are some good performances, but the subplots are strange and are not resolved. <br /> <br /> Also, I found all the characters unpleasant, and if you can not identify with at least one character, there is not much to get excited about. All in all, this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.
