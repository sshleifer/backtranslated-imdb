When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, be careful with its soft and colorful upholstery. <br /> <br /> The movie starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a couple who are having a difficult time with their relationship. One night there is an argument and, to compensate, Josh asks Emily to come on a road trip to her father's house, where Josh plans to deliver a LazyBoy violet recliner for his father's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flying brother, Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow who has more contact with other people's lives than his own. between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (initially it is very dirty and melts until Josh "convinces" the original owner to recondition it). Rhett quickly realizes that the cause of all Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and puts him on the torch one night ... <br /> <br /> And that's the last thing we hear from the chair, although there are many minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the movie is The Puffy Chair, when it is not the chair that occupies center stage. It's the doomed relationship of Josh and Emily and the way the trip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair is destroyed, it is never mentioned again, even though they arrive at the place of Josh's parents on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does his father mention it. There is no connection between this and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why is not there a relationship with it in the end? Bad script. <br /> <br /> The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and he's not very good). Almost all scenes have a quick approach to characters that appear grainy and unfocused before the camera's autofocus is updated and self-responding. Initially, it acquired an artistic and picturesque feel, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All the actors / actresses did good jobs. But the poor quality of the production, the forced end and the lack of coherence with the title caused many problems in this film.
