Horrible, terrible, terrible The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force myself to see it until the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it's much better and you will not have to endure all these silly images and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I've never seen such a bad movie.
