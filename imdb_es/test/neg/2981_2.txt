I saw that this movie was coming out and I could not wait to see it. I have to say that I was very disappointed. This would have been better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed very hurried. They did not explain things very clearly. In the end they showed John Paul II, alive and well, and in the next scene he was dead. Never an explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC dropped the ball big in something that could have been great. In general I think this movie was a blur. It seemed that a drunken monkey jumped from one point to another of John Paul's life and never explained how or why things happened. Like when his older brother leaves, it was never explained to him that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home. Also when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was it. I was very disappointed with the film in general.
