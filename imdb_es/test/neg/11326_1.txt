Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture sounds true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. In the final scene, I was encouraging the car to run over that ridiculous child, one of the worst childhood actors in history. <br /> <br /> I've only heard one name on it: Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!
