When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it could be a good thing. but no. It was a good movie, it's not good, but it's not bad for most, but then you get to the end and lose all credibility. They should have left him dead. They did not leave the last bit, it did not make any sense. If they had something in the beginning of a plane crash, yes, but we did not, so it did not work. The first thing is fine and I give them credit for that, but the rest is just bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and see this movie DON "T" It is horrible to go and rent something that is really worth seeing. 2/10
