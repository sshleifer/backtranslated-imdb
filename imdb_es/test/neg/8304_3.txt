Wow. Simply wow. I had never before seen a horror movie in which I seemed a fan of bad insertions that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I came across "Lady Frankenstein." This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and puts it completely upside down ... and not in a good way. If you have seen this movie, or you have found it on Italian television, or have the version dubbed in the 50 Chilling Classics Box that I have, like the number 24. And let's say there is a reason why these films are here. Because they are not very good. however, enough of that, in the movie. <br /> <br /> Start with Dr. Frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who ... obviously is not igor for some reason. Your daughter graduated from the university (?) Appears and declares how you have just graduated with a medical degree, because yes. There were so many doctors back then. So she says how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no. And then he makes the monster and kills it. Then she laments for exactly 7 seconds and then invents a story with the assistant how he was a thief. The monster escapes and goes on a rampage. <br /> <br /> Okay, I really can not believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. dies like ... 20 minutes in. and then your daughter takes over. that ... does not make much sense, but of course. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is now devastating ... is to make ANOTHER monster! Oh yes, how I love your logic. so his new monster gets the body killing someone and putting the wizard's brain into it ... I know. Just nod and continue with this. So the monsters meet and surpass it. I love how the assistant asks "why do not we let the mobs kill him?" and she responds with "They would not know how to kill him!" And in the end he kills it with an ax in the head. LOL. oh yes, no one else could have discovered THAT one. so in the end the brain changed the new monster kills Mrs. Frankenstein. The End. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. Seriously, it was as if someone had written a fanfic of autoinsertos. There is no other way to describe this movie. There were also some strange nude scenes. Like, this girl was having sex naked in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the boy leaves. LOL. Good Guy. Then she struggles a little and dies ... to be honest, I really do not know what she died of. But whatever. It's Lady Frankenstein. It does not have to make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie had many of those "Why?" Moments to the point that I just gave up. Movies should not do that, but for some reason I see more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So the last word, it's not the worst movie I've seen in this package, but it's a bit boring, and it's full of many holes and random things. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets 3 porn scenes of Frankenstein, out of 10
