The film by Olivier Assayas stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who is in financial trouble. In desperation, he will sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle, a Far Eastern company. When Madsen begins to move away from his company, Asia Argento returns to his life. The couple had a torrid love story that included doing business favors for Madsen (with said Golden Eagle). Once Argento enters the film, the film follows it when we see the tangled web that is woven and how the complications become dangerously and violently out of control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. Actually, I was quite bored as the film seems to go from one pillar to another for much of the first hour during which I kept asking myself what was the point rather than to provide a substantial role for Argento. Argento, daughter of director Dario Argento and director in her own right, is a unique actress. Sometimes, surprisingly good, it is more frequent that she does not give a strange image of a damaged human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. I do not think it works completely here mainly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. I did not care what was going on, so her injured girl just rubbed me the wrong way (she looked more crazy than anything else). I do not blame the actors, but the writer / director Assayas, who once again has built a complicated story with the kind of parts that the actors love to tackle, but which make the audience scratch their heads because they do not really work. <br /> <br /> If you must try it on cable
