I was not so impressed with this movie, which I found quite boring and simple. The line of the plot was interesting, a boy who created his own university and enrolled hundreds of children, but the laughter was few and far between. The jokes were not really funny and I did not bother with any of the scenes. The characters were not intriguing and I felt nothing for any of them, not even the fat and bespectacled kid who tried to join the group of fraternities. It was a good first watch, but it did not impress me and it is not one I would recommend. Comparing it with other films of the same genre, that is, American Pie is simply cruel, because there is a movie that laughed a lot. This ACCEPTED could not raise a smile!
