I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but seeing this was like coming home and seeing your wife having "relationships" with a flame. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I'm supposed to write 10 lines, but I do not even know what else to say. I laughed a couple of times, but only because I was drinking. A movie like that should be at least fun when you're drunk. Was not. Maybe the flames are just fun and normal cartoon people are not. Either way, just stick with The New Groove from The Emporer if you want a funny movie, with cartoons and flame themes. Line 10 is this line here.
