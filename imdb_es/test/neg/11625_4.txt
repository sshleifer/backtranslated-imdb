When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, I was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always an eternal story that will never die, well, hopefully But I thought I would see the sequels of The Swan Princess to see how they were and, unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that simply disappoints rather than entertains. The only character I found still very funny was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. But with the changes in the voice, they were remarkable and also bothered me a bit, I do not want to be demanding, just that it was too weird for me. The story was also taken more or less from the first Swan Princess, only the villain of this film follows in the footsteps of Rothbart. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their first anniversary, but Derek has been too worried about fighting for his kingdom to keep him safe. With his mother's birthday that is also approaching, he forgets that as there is a new villain in the city, Clavious, who hopes to go beyond the powers of Rothbart and kidnaps the Queen on his birthday. But Odette must change back to her own swan to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> Swan Princess 2 is, of course, more than good for children, that does not matter to me, it's good. Clean fun for them. However, the reason why these sequels are disappointing is because it is usually only for children, that is the audience they aspire to, but it is more pleasant when everyone can enjoy the jokes and the story. Now there are some laughs and giggles here and there, but this was not so smart in my opinion for the first Swan Princess. I would recommend it for the little ones, but if you are looking for a funny cartoon movie, I recommend that you stay with the first Princess Swan. <br /> <br /> 4/10
