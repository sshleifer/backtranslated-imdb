Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that are not successful in what they were trying to do. The film is an ultra-slow, questionable, effective and irritating 76-minute experience that attempts to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens with God presented as a psychopath in a chair. The man who tears open opens his stomach with a knife. Mother nature emerges from the entrails, blood and human waste. She proceeds to impregnate herself with the semen of the dead god. Later she gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A retard who constantly mistreats a group of cannibalic people whom I believe represents the representation of humanity. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" has a twisted and disturbing look about the origin of life. Demonstrate the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark of humanity. The problem in the movie comes from two points. One is that the film is too slow in its display. What we get is a good thirty minutes devoted to showing how the Son of the Earth is constantly trembling naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by humanity. Such insipid prolongation becomes boring rather quickly and lacks the strength to strike the spectator's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point is the visual appearance and sound of "Beggoten's". The cinematography of a grainy, inverted, black-and-white frame enchant the disturbing factor of the plot, but these novelties often work only in short periods of time. Then, gradually, begin to lose its effect as the audience gets used to the appearance. The audio suffers from the same problems. It is constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast that I felt the need to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses its charm shortly after it begins. Try to be original and creative, but fails to expand the ideas hinted at by the vague plot, but repeats the same scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "Begotten" is stuck in a moment. Although the plot tries to advance, the images and audio remain the same at all times. Show the same action in a slightly different way with only a slightly different sound. A trick can not just make a movie. It also needs rhythm and variety, something that Merhige seems to have forgotten.
