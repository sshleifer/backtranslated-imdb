It is easy to say at the beginning of this film exactly what will happen and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on vacation. This was done during the late seventies Ultra Nazis, when supposedly blonde women were ultra-American survivors and brunettes deserved death. About, and the viewer knows it. There is no mystery or suspense. People fight, but everything is very predictable for the prejudices of the time, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The five people run into two wild young characters, and they go crazy. Everyone is crazy, so the team of directors and writers can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the boy is attracted to the blonde, who does not really have much to do, and ignores a super sexy brunette that any heterosexual man would go crazy. One should remember that in the seventies, films were aimed at attracting women and not men. <br /> <br /> Totally horrible and totally depressing.
