I'm going to this game and it's fine, I suppose. I just expected a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely difficult, even if you read the instructions that you can not get. Also, the graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could benefit from some improvements, says that if the guards are walking in the water and you shoot a sticky electric discharge in the water, the guard fry but nothing happens. In my opinion, this is the worst of the three. I have not played the first one, but I played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. This game deserves a 4/10 however. I could do with some improvements.
