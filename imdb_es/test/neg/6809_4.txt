Dustin Hoffman's first feature film is not as bad as it is said to be; a Spanish / Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is uneven but in general it deviates and deals with a large number of somber characters in search of $ 1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite being a third party billed, after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself expire before the sequence of credits has come to roll!). <br /> <br /> Hoffman's performance, obviously, is not as nuanced as in later films, but he manages to avoid embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to a kind klutz - an agent of the US treasury of Sicilian descent Accident-prone (called Puzzu, which no one seems to be able to fix!) sent by his company to recover the money and told him to remain "discreet" but, on the other hand, he is always getting into trouble, although ultimately he demonstrates be surprisingly ingenious in finding the loot, thwarting the thieves and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter, who is a little lost here)! <br /> <br /> However, the best moments of the film are those of the soft gangster Riccardo Garrone: aside from his possible hard character and the hilarious use of the dialect, he is flanked by a trio of idiots that more often than not! Do not prove an obstacle in fulfilling your various schemes! Also, in view of the history that takes place in Rome, it is strange that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (no doubt a requirement of the co-production agreement). <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've missed Hoffman's other Italian comedy, ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972), several times (I think, mainly, because Leonard Maltin only qualifies him * 1/2 in his "Movie and Video Guide" ... but, then, MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a PUMP!); with Pietro Germi directing and co-starring Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable, and I really hope it will reappear on Italian television soon ...
