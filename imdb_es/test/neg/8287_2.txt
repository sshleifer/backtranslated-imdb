A star of the high school track falls dead after winning a race; Shortly after, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to realize that all members of her sister's athletic team are disappearing. Who could be the killer? You may not care enough to want to find out. <br /> <br /> The rude, cheap and amateur slasher has no value, although Christopher George (as the nasty track coach) tries to give him a boost with an intense performance. It's not even worth mentioning the gore. The whole thing is lame from beginning to end, beginning with opening the film in a music montage at the disco and the E.J. Peaker, once was co-star of the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character called "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie." This may mean that we should not take the movie seriously, but in any case it is chaos. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of routine slasher trash that makes "Friday the 13th" movies look like plays. of art in comparison. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest may be wanting to see an early appearance of the Vanna White movie, of all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
