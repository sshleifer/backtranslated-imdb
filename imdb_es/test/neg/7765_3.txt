All my friends and other co-workers think that this show is great. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I could be the only woman alive! I only saw him because my best friend loves him and he thinks he's Charlotte's character! <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot (if you can call it that) is about four Samantha Superslut women (Kim Cattrall) who most likely have all the sexually transmitted diseases available and the mossy, brown and green, considering that it is sexual tri (will try anything). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most women in her 40s, even in New York, but it's not the show she would not have some entertainment since Samantha (along with some good New York scenery) It is the only reason to look and those are not enough reason. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a high-class, well-dressed NY idiot who still believes in the myth of Pince Charming. No matter how sweet and beautiful it is, do not let that fool you, it spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is angry, stereotyped, feminist. I think that in an episode one thinks that she is a lesbian, but apparently it is not ... What a pity it is almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the most annoying character. I swear I thought I was looking at the man in front of Twisted Sister, Dee Snider, more manly looking, dressing, sissy, brother! This is a girl who seeks can not live without you, love ... Have you heard of a puppy? <br /> <br /> This program is stupid and I love to make fun of it because I hear it is something like New awakening for women. That's just sad if you look to see addicted people, pathetic and whore with too expensive clothes that drink cosmopolitans and sound like a 15-year nuisance with cocaine, so there's a show for you ........ ... Simply use protection.
