One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, commercializing a "shock" or "gore" factor to sell tickets and buy Birch a new diamond necklace. Another of the worst things is to completely misrepresent the real facts of an incredible saga by making events, dialogues and images to the director's taste. Finally, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is to use the actors at the base of the barrel and film it all on a sound stage that is rented for fifty cents a day. The three of these transvestites from whom the creators of this film are guilty. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. Filmmakers should not only be ashamed to have done it, but they should feel ashamed to exploit negatively the heroes of this story, who are the people who experienced this tragedy first hand, both the living and the dead.
