My partner and I decided to see this obvious scrap piece purely based on its slogan. After almost 30 years of bad bastards and rudimentary teenagers, I can not believe that only now a nerdy brainiac nerdy presents the brilliant witty slogan "They Axed for it"! Apart from that, the "Slaughter of Miner" is as random, annoying and forgettable as all the others. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and presents all terribly stereotyped characters to whom you want a horrible and painful death. The effects of Gore are designed by computer and, therefore, are more than lamentable, and the "big" obligatory stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely wasted despite their high turnover. Damned mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal scenario of terror. the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" already discovered it in the early 80's? but his boring film simply does not have innovative ideas or remotely surprising elements to offer. A handful of greedy twenty-something losers, who refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly can not stand it, desecrate an old mine in search of the gold that is supposedly hidden there. Of course, they unknowingly resuscitate the zombie miner in this way and he only has 150 years of rest to prepare for a massacre of teenagers. Hurrah! The cast is exceptionally irritating in this case. All the girls have impressive frames, but they refuse to show anything. Instead, everyone prefers to whine endlessly and take unnecessary risks. Low-light kids clearly serve as screen fillings. In her barely five minutes of play, Karen Black still manages to play dumb by representing the most crazy and hysterical local woman in history. The zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but it looks good and is reasonably menacing when shown in the shadow of the moon as it swings around its pickaxe. Since the best of "Miner's Massacre" refers to the slogan mentioned above and you can read it in the box in the video store itself, there is not much more to recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler scored some modest successes during the 1980s, notably the original "Troll" and a fair sequel to "Friday the 13th," but obviously it's time to retire now.
