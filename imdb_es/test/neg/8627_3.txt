A true insult to the original "Spoorloos", which is one of the most disturbing films (and I try it as a compliment!) That I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is chilling and bright, the new version is flat and even boring, especially the end of the "happy ending" removes the bit of suspense that was in this film in the first place. <br /> <br /> Although it is a distortion of this type (especially the grafting of a "The happy ending" that was not there before) it is quite frequent in the "Hollywood" remakes of European art films and it could be expected, The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this dwarf mess was created by the same filmmaker who made the original "Spoorloos" ... <br /> <br /> Why Mr. Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in that way , surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination at all costs, since it could ruin the original for you even if you observe * after * that, let alone the other way around ...
