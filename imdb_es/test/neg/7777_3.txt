There is no way to express in words how bad they are, without form, without form and without laughter these films of "Vice Academy" really are. You have to experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row, writer-director Rick Sloane does not show an ounce of talent to write or direct. There is nothing here that a person over 5 years old will create or laugh at, but the nudity (very brief) and other elements of the "plot" make the films not suitable for children. Which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental abilities of children of 5 years. Elizabeth Kaitan is a more than welcome substitute for Linnea Quigley: she is more and more cheerful and beautiful, and her wonderful and big smile is almost the only thing that can make the spectator smile. But seeing her and the other girls in this movie is like seeing a bouquet of flowers in a desert covered in manure. (*)
