We can see who the good guys are. The Union. And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals the elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys, so when you watch the movie, this can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst type of filming: manipulative and childish. The plot focuses on a cop who is between the good and the bad, and is caught in this ugly movie. It's boring and meaningless. Star Keach's narrative is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, overcame the hilt, playing the guy who does not like anyone and who is not supposed to like us. It takes a long time for this hole to take off, and for the title to assert itself; then, when it takes off, it crashes a minute later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
