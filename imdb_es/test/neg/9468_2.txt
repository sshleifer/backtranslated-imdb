A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the release of the DOCTOR GORE video (also known as THE BODY SHOP), in which he mentioned his collaborative efforts with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson invented the "gore effects" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and some other Lewis movies in the late 60s. Lewis comments that while 2,000 MANIACS was a "five gallon" movie (in reference to the amount of blood required on stage) , the productions of Lewis-Patterson were images of "fifteen gallons". Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen-gallon" movie; he only talks about the movies he and Patterson made together. Lewis has confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he had even seen the Patterson movie! So take it carefully. <br /> <br /> This may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels it has an "ending". Only a little connective tissue is missing. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a definite stage presence and a dry sense of humor, which helps make this simplistic show a little more visible than it should be. There is an extremely squalid plot, even BLOOD FEAST is more complex, and a musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and a lot of skin. The complete central section of the film involves the construction of a "perfect woman"; This is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty and laughable. <br /> <br /> Patterson, the director, is well above his head, but he strives to tell his story creatively, if it is possible to use the Frankenstein clich√©s creatively. But the best reason to watch this movie (on Something Weird's DVD, if possible) is to present Nashville's perfect whining, "A Heart Dies Every Minute" by Bill Hicks. It is not the truth!
