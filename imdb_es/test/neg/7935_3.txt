OK, here is the deal. I love action movies and, in general, I have no problem suspending a lot of disbelief about plot holes or other unlikely actions. However, this film went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me understand. The police sent a gangster and a notorious police killer (along with other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. Then they are forced to stop in an enclosure where exactly two policemen work, one of which is one day after retirement and the other is a fire. Apparently, the building was about to be closed, so, somehow, the police decided that everyone else in the compound had the night off for the eve of the new year. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne appears to get Fishburne out before he can throw him and other dirty cops. (Although we never found out anything about their relationship or treatment). Interestingly, the cops who launch the assault on the premises are in complete SWAT equipment with night vision goggles, assault rifles, the full nine meters. Later, they even bring a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can not just leave the station with a full team worth of equipment without someone asking you what you're doing. And the police helicopter? In the supposedly terrible winter storm? Also, is not there anyone near the venue who hears or sees this important siege with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire firing? I mean seriously, come on. I know this is set in Detroit, but even there it would generate suspicion in a supposedly secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the test room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and can be used. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were not No other obvious problems too. On the one hand, the first few minutes of the film were recorded very well in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought I was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the movie has no sense of rhythm, tension or drama. The "characters" are not related to each other in any way, which is probably due in large part to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is not enough interesting action to make this a good action movie, and there is not enough development / character narration to make this a passable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing that the director tries to make interesting or intense. Oh, and by the way, the final scene in the desert? Uh, I thought this was in the middle of a deteriorated industrial section of Detroit and suddenly we're in the woods. The acting is not terrible in this movie, it's just that the direction and writing are atrocious. I really enjoy some of the other movies of Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy, but this one is terrible.
