It is so false! The plot looks like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation movie. The common themes of blaxploitation, such as racism, oppression and the struggle for the integrity of their community, are described in a simplistic / superficial way. And the jokes are not even funny! Dolemite does these stand-up monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this canned laugh. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's imitating funk. For a better comedy in a blaxploitation, try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience, try "Black Heat".
