I can not believe I really bought this movie! That sucks ... Where I live Mexican movies Mexican films are never announced, they are not even available ... they can not be found in regular rental places ... so I had to buy it ... I really like the Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots, to my people, and they are very different from what you used to do ... but this was so predictable! You could guess what would happen ... It's not a horrible movie! It just was not worth what I paid for it! haha ... but if you have time and you are really bored, yes, you should see it ... but if you like Mexican movies and you love theater, then do not see it, it will be painful! Hahaha
