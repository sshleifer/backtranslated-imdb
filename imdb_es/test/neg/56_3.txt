This program should be titled, "When bad writing happens to good actors" taking into account that most players have shown immense talent elsewhere, for example. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope that the frantic pace of the show adjusts as the series unfolds along with the obvious cliches and dialogues, so absurd that I wondered how stupid the writers imagined the main audience would be. They hit us in the head with the main points of this program, instead of letting it be discovered gradually, almost as if the writers felt they had to explain that the main character is a kind of avenging angel, sentenced to redeem himself. of sins, both venial and mortal, through going in your taxi to many matters. Watching the premiere required a lot of suspension of disbelief, that Mike Olshanskey's fares would spill so quickly into his guts and he would feel compelled to intervene in the lives of strangers. That possesses those abilities of "Super-Cop", to be everything for all people, weapons expert, master of martial arts, psychologist, father-confessor, locksmith, etc., to infinity. Pure and drastic fantasy. What about the recent Philidelphia-based television shows that everyone seems to be imbued with an ugly ex-wife and a very malicious creature? Exaggerated. I wanted to like this program, I really did it, because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different from that of many of the clones that appeared in the program this season and stars in some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid this is another good idea possibly ruined by careless execution.
