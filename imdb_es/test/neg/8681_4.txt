On the positive side, this contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, particularly related to Himmler, the SS and its research branch. It also has good piano music, some interesting images and excellent camera work. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very poor historical work. It does not have a clear objective and everything could be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler established a department in the SS to investigate the origins of the German race. They were all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all kinds of places ... (None of these routes were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were hardly refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were the same through historical proof. They did not find any. The members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS and, therefore, linked to the Holocaust, and were seen as well after the war and continued to run the German institutes. Fascinating, but never thoroughly explored and no coherent argument is presented in the program that condemns these people or exonerates them. Nor does this seem to be the objective of the program, the objective of the program is not clear, it jumps from one topic to another. The witnesses, although presented as credible, are few and not supported. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not know where it goes or why and fails to impress. The topics are fascinating, but this program tries to cover a large area of ​​research and, as a result, does not seem to know what is happening. I would avoid this. <br /> <br /> Also the 'Holy Grail' is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except in the passage. Mentions of expeditions are made to look for the Christian holy grail, but they are never fulfilled. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is unconvincing and incomplete.
