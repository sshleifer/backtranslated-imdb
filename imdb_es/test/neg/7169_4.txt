George Burns returns as the almighty joshing after enjoying great success with "Oh, God!" From 1977, an optimistic fantasy that succeeded in a sudden need in the 1970s to move from thrillers driven by the devil to comic redemption. The original was more in line with the "Topper" comedies of the 1930s than a return to religious cinema to feel good. Here, God appears to a young woman (Louanne, who had previously starred in a theatrical production of "Annie") and asks him to spread his Divine Word, causing nothing but problems on the part of adults in the process. A quirky, family-oriented film seems to be affectionate enough, and Burns agrees with a good deal of ironic teasing, but the writing is half slapstick and half serious, with the adults of the piece considering putting the little one Louanne away, all of which makes God look more like a troublemaker than an old friend. Louanne is another problem: a cheerful girl with bright eyes, is not trained to act on the screen and, at times, seems uncomfortable. The production of medium budget has a television movie appearance, with few elegant touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first "Oh, God!" in the sense that it brings a melancholy feeling to the mix, which is welcome. It is the most subtle moment of the movie. ** since ****
