I wish I had voted this movie a ten, it's so funny. If they had wanted it to be so fun, I would have given him a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it's the most fun you'll want to see. See the giant flash on the screen! Where he came from? What is it? It flies, it terrifies, it's electrifying, it's on ropes. This bird has true personality. I was about ten years old when I first saw him, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were the same!
