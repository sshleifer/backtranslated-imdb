Surprising that something like this can be seen by the public. I knew it was because of Uwe Boll, and I found it in the bargain bin in a store for $ 2 (still quite expensive, considering) but morbid curiosity led me to see this, and: <br /> <br /> 1 ). I'm pretty sure this is a scam of Seven, Silence of the Lambs and American Psycho, all in one, with a dialogue that may have been written by pre-teens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and it's so utterly weird and creepy that almost anyone could KNOW that he must be the crazed serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a homemade dinner, and what does she get for her problems? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop, who drives a VW Bug, a new style, that is, with a siren. A VW Bug ... that will instill fear in the hearts of criminals when they see THAT coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks up with her fianc√©, but she still has a "non-committed" party, complete with "it's not a wedding cake." Imagine the surprise of everyone who appears (he was, of course, invited) and everyone is shot. <br /> <br /> 6). Actually, this should have been # 1, really. The killer in this is known as "The monkey maker." This is, without a doubt, the most stupid murderer name that someone could have found in a million years. Presumably, it has something to do with the saying "do not see evil, do not hear evil, do not speak evil", complete with monkeys. It is possible that the monkeys also have something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there is a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the movie. Is there bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a cage surrounded with links in the chain with, uh, gang members hitting each other with baseball bats? That is what it seemed. And, of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, really cool stuff (?!) It happens in the basement, where a questionable "actor" tells a woman to sign a confession before being shot, this being I suppose, a snuff movie? I'm not sure how this fits with the rest of the movie, and Boll probably was not either, so if he was not worried, then I will not worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you are seeing something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe of which is TYPE like ours, but where things are enough so that they do not seem correct. You have entered "The Boll Zone". Get out as fast as possible, and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
