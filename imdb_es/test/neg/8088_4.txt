If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of fake Patagones at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it feels to have sex with a girl while she throws up then this is the movie for you. Alternately, the way to break the neck, between the romantic and disgusting comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The charming Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz (tell me another) who is in many situations silhouetted with other women, but surprisingly, there are no nudity. Jake Busey rebels like a hunting dog you would not want as a friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are good and they are a convincing couple, but the film is too busy trying to get upset to be good.
