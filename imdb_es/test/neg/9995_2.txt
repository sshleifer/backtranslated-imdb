A lot of people said that this was a great movie with Hoffman that offered a great performance. I went from suspended disbelief, to restless boredom, to almost leaving. There is not there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman does everything possible. He is committed to performance. But sometimes, interpreting an affected man is similar to the affected actor who chews the stage. <br /> <br /> No character in the film other than the cape is much more than the placeholders: nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film shows the manipulative, groomed and dishonest sides of the cape. he shows them so many times that I began to wonder why: do the filmmakers believe that we need everything to be clear? and again? and again? He often refers to Capote's genius but does not show it. He shows him surrounded by fanatics and flatterers, but he never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> but my goal is not to deconstruct the movie. I am sure that others will have other interpretations. For me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.
