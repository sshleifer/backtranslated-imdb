This film twists the facts of Anne's and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was in fact quite a dim and foolish creature, and turn her into the "good" sister is nonsense. It is Anne who, in fact, was the much more interesting character, and that is why her life has been counted so frequently, and not Mary's. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I do not get it to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... for me, it's Henry the real criminal. Whatever Anne's motives for winning the king and retaining her affections to win a crown and husband, the timing of these real-life events must be taken into account. Anne, in comparison with most of the courtiers of her time, was a relatively innocent figure. Most modern historians discount or have refuted most of the myths and slander that this film perpetuates about her, and I have never heard of someone who really believes the rumor that she has slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone, without knowing anything about this period in history, could go away believing anything that this film has presented as "done". <br /> <br /> I won 'I do not even get into the weird movie of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure the cameras were not invented in the 16th century, so I do not understand why Anne and Mary are talking to one throughout the movie ... it's a very bad idea of ​​the plot and it's jarring and annoying, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Anne of the Thousand Days is not accurate either, but it is infinitely more entertaining and at least it comes close to telling the story of One of the most intriguing women in history. Do not even think about renting this ... it's two hours you'll never go back!
