I did not buy this, I did not rent it, I was on PPV and someone burned a copy and lent it to me, so at least I did not waste money. For someone who did Darkness, The Nameless, Devil's Backbone, this is a pretty boring movie. It seems to have something to do with a group of girls who were in a convent in the past and now they have all grown up and chasing and killing them one by one for a nun who comes out of the kitchen sink. The toilet, and even managed to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. And what makes this nun so bad and nasty (and wet?) I do not know, this was so boring that at some point, in half, I stopped him, I kept it and watched something else. I was not even interested in discovering it, really. Oh, sure, there are some lovely ladies to watch but, hey, are they two lesbians? I suppose there is a picture on the bedside table of a young girl's bedroom and what horror movie worth its salt would not be complete these days without a lesbian couple? Yeah, whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and that's what Adrienne Barbeau has, by the way, not John's Malkovich).
