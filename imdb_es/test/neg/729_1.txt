Usually, when I do not see a program in an original career, I find it later on the cable and I realize that it is a gem. The "Gimore Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I lost it. <br /> <br /> I really despise the programs that fill every minute of the actors' space with jokes, stupid and boring. This is only one hour of that. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she is bipolar and does not have lithium. She never stopped talking; Every minute, every second, talking to each person with whom he interacted. Worse yet, his speech is childish and moody, like, Valley Girl. He talked about the boys, his hair, his mother, his clothes. What is the sitch like? (by situation). I have seen this program three times and I still do not understand the point of this series. It is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it does not make sense, except to make three generations of women in a family resemble the "Girls" of the Planet Mars. In comparison, the males are intelligent and make the show a little visible. If Lorelei ever existed and tried to hook me into a conversation, I would have to make an effort to get rid of her. Obviously, she does not know how to interpret in a subtle way to stop talking and start listening to another person. She also does not know how to realize the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In a show, Lorelei arrives home after a date close to 10 pm. He got the date after chasing a guy he met at an auction. She enters her daughter's room, where the daughter asks him how it went. She tells him how boring the boy was. Your date somehow has some words on the edge. Lorelei complained that the man did not stop talking (drowning). I wish the date knew how lucky he was. <br /> <br /> Another person here commented on how the mother acts as a teenager and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her child. This obviously a 40-year-old mom dresses and seems to hit the mall with her friends from high school. <br /> <br /> I thought that this program should have been followed by "Just Shoot Me", because that is exactly how I felt.
