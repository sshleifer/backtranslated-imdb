This could very well be the worst movie I've seen in my life. Normally I do not watch movies like this, however, I was forced to see this at school. What torment! <br /> <br /> The story is as normal and boring as it can be: boy meets girl on the Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is in against his love. At the end of the film, the film becomes a kind of strange kung-fu movie where the boys in white fight against those in black. Terrible! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad that it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie that I think are supposed to be great are so simple and ridiculous that even I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan is possibly the most annoying person I've seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming the Dutch Ed Wood. His movies are so bad that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> However, Victor LÃ¶w offers a surprisingly good performance and Daan Schuurmans also acts well. <br /> <br /> So, for your own good, do not do it. Do not watch this movie However, if you like to see soaps, it may be worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
