There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something that I found really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey began to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, "Smoooooookin!" 'Nuff said. So, why do a sequel / prequel? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey would not do it, should have been enough clue that he did not deserve to be created. But then they simply make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy Why is this man still allowed to breathe? Writing and history: terrible. Why would I want to see a baby with the mask? Also, why would I want to see it fly? Forever? HOW COULD SOMEONE COULD THIS BE A GOOD IDEA? The acting is despicable, in fact, almost everything about this movie is. I'm trying to stay calm, or IMDb probably will not allow me to post this. In a few words: do not look at this piece of garbage. Pick up the original, see how good Cameron Diaz looked and how Jim Carrey used to have a career, and laugh. Do not waste a second of your time on this.
