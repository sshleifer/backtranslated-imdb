I spent a lot of time reviewing all the criticisms of this movie. I totally agree with almost all the critics when saying that Noah's Ark is shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Do not the executives of NBC have class? I feel sick to see both parts of this miniseries. The script is so silly, so useless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURED! I can understand making some changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie changed almost everything in the story. God himself will take the trouble to kill the entire population of Earth, but somehow he misses a guy who is trying to sell things to Noah. Give me a break! And what happened to Noah's children acting like Indiana Jones, saving girls in distress? If all that is not bad enough, there is a part where God apologizes to Noah and says "I'm sorry, Noah, I was wrong". Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN NOT BE BAD! This film is the most insipid and dishonorable Bible film ever made.
