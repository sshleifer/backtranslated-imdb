Like most of those who watch this movie, I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. The two are extremely underestimated and, unfortunately, because of that, they have to head a lot of garbage. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and offers help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie is not as terrible as it could have been. I have seen both in much worse, both independently and working together (LAPD, horrible movie). The direction was quite bad and the script needed some rewrites, but both give the best possible performance with the material offered. In addition, the ending is quite strong, so it can be said that the story had potential. But when a brilliant review of a film is "it could have been much worse", it does not say much for the film itself. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one that can be easily omitted. If none of these actors attracts you. But if you're a fan of either or both, give him a watch. Both give strong performances that overshadow the obvious defects of the film. Trust me, there are much worse options out there.
