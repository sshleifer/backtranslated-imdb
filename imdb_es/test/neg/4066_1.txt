You gotta see This. I could not stop laughing at the stupid things that I saw in this film even after the event. Maybe there are a million individual errors and stupidities in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it much later. We had a great time AFTER the movie. Truly. My friend and I spent 40 minutes on a long bus ride home chatting about this movie as we have seen the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately we were talking about all those bad things that we had just seen.
