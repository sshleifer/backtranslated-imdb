How one of you gave more than 2 stars surprises me. I made an IMDb account just to comment on this cr @ p movie. The performance is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. It would not deserve any star at all if it were not for the soundtrack of the descent (and yet, there are still some outrageous clown tracks, especially those that present the oboe and sound like the background music of the cartoon comedy in white and black and nowhere, they fit the anticipated mood of the haunting scenes and quality cinema.The dialogue and the plot are as complex as those of a Dr. Sues book.These actors are horrible. Actually, I'm watching this movie right now and, with every word, I'm surprised that everyone is bringing this shit in. The only reason I did not deactivate the movie was because I got involved by creating an IMDb account and posting this review. conventional films, I dig stupid movies, I dig indie retro movies and almost any other type / genre if it is done well. My brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and that He has a great taste for movies; From the moment he told me the title, I looked at him as if he were crazy. It's costing me a lot to finish this tirade because there's a lot of badness to talk about. The only way I can rationalize good grades here is that they were paid to give high marks to this movie. It is so badly done and it is not close to the dramatic, artistic, complex, well written, well formed or even bearable. If this were the final product of my hard work as a director, I would be embarrassed to release it to the public, so I do not even feel sorry for the director if he reads this. What the hell were you thinking, boy?
