I had stifled high hopes for this David Lynch movie, whom I really like, but everyone's bad performance, but Naomi Watts was the first clue that this was a futile effort. Some Twin Peaks characters are recycled in this movie, but it was not strange, it was not interesting (except for the topless Watts scenes) and the peculiarities were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'll probably give Lynch one more chance, but the exaggeration around this movie just does not work, especially for those of us the fans that we saw Eraserhead when he first came out.
