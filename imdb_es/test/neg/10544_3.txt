The Toxic Avenger, a horribly deformed creature of superhuman size and strength, is back in this sequel that makes everything go wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, who is in collusion with an evil corporation that only wants the avenger to leave to obtain a Tromaville domain in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who have a different name in this, a much less lugubrious, much more comical, and a plot that can not contain a candle to the original. Even with the totally uncut version that can only be obtained if you buy the DVD set Tox Box, the gore is the only thing that happens with this. And if you run into ANY other version, forget about enjoying it at all. While the first is a low budget classic, this simply is not. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast pinch slip; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a villain is completely naked; and some extras in the scene of a bath house show several amounts of skins <br /> <br /> DVD of director's cut without Tox Box classification Extras: Introduction and comments of the director Lloyd Kaufman; Second comment with the director Lloyd Kaufman, the editors of Troma Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japenese TV; Interview with Fangoria's editor-in-chief, Michael Gingold; Interview conducted by Mike Mayo de Videohound; the same damn Radiation March that is on EVERY Troma DVD; Clip of Lisa Gaye; "Toxie 15 years later" mockumentary; 2 PSAs; Troma intelligence test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Announcement of the autobiography of Lloyd Kaufman; Gallery of stills; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Nuke 'Em High Class", "Sgt.
