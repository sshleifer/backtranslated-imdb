If you are looking for summer success, Dark Harvest 2 could be your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it seems that they were filmed with a Sony Handicam and were edited with iMovie), especially the sound effects: they sound directly on the CD "Spooky Halloween Sounds"! The scarecrow on the cover, although it does not appear in the film and otherwise has no relevance, is terribly realistic! From the beginning to the end, you will see how a man searches aimlessly for his daughters through a MAIZE, a game of words. In the climactic end of the movie, you'll see, well ... you'll have to see yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is that you do not get close to 1000 yards from this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be a funny type of "Troll 2", but it is not. I cried after seeing this movie, because I realized that I had spent money on it (and I found the $ 4 that I spent on renting it). Actually I fell asleep for 20 minutes and I still knew what was happening.
