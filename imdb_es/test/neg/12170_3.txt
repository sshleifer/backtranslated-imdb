First of all, this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, story, novel or anything else. From the EW website, and its review on the program when it was first broadcast, "... he never writes to his audience, and never reveals contempt for his subjects." His first original work for television, "The Golden Years of Stephen King "'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 pm), is no exception." <br /> <br /> The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, What we never saw The end after the cliffhanger they let us in. But this was never made clear to the spectators who were left wondering how this all ends. <br /> <br /> When the series came out on video, it was said that it had the "never seen ending". "I should have said:" the end that should never be seen! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The ending was the only significant part that was changed for the video (although parts of everything were omitted), and that changed the ending It was what destroyed the story, for example, instead of our two intrepid FBI agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad and fleeing the Jude Anderson's evil The Shop (as it was originally issued), Jude just walks up to them ... And they shoot him Bang, dead, and no real emotion to speak on the scene .Ditto in the bit with Harlan and his wife While the original ending left us with a spectacular perch on the cliff, in the video, they simply leave the cock-a-doodie car. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** < br /> <br /> It was a sad ending to a well-made miniseries, and it makes the video not worth buying, not even renting it. Horra your money and your time.
