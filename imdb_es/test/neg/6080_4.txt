I am always interested in watching sloppy movies that seem to have good credentials, but in this case the negligence of the film seems justified. Obviously, based on some real incidents during World War II, the film simply does not connect with the viewer for some reason that is not very clear to me. A very likely reason is that, in the impression I saw in TCM, anyway, none of the scenes where the Germans spoke to each other were given titles. This interesting concept of direction, to allow the spectator who does not speak German to simply guess by "context" what the Germans say to each other, is, in my book, a total failure and helps block the viewer. Also, the way the movie starts, simply by letting us fall into a very confusing situation without much configuration, is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputations of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be questioned by this movie.
