This is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander had a good performance, but he did not look anything like Michael. I feel that Michael was portrayed as a stupid person that I do not think he was (although he sometimes trusted the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think Latoya should have been represented in this, she was always photographed with her brother in the 80's. I never thought that any of the secondary actors resembled their counterparts. There were some things that were inaccurate. Lisa-Marie Presley's son looked like 4 at the wedding scene, even though he still did not have 2 when Lisa and Michael got married. Also, when Michael tells his mother Katherine that he believes he and Debbie should get married if she is taking her son, it was Katherine's idea that the two of them get married.
