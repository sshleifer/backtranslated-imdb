For those of you who have some kind words for this movie, I suspect you did not see it when it was published as "Parties: The Clonus Horror". <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring movie. The mark was lost in at least three ways. It was not good enough to be scary; it was not bad enough to be fun (although MST3K took care of that); and, even in 1979, the plot was not original. <br /> <br /> The first candidates are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It is the same idea (clones as spare parts). The film is entertaining, and had an excellent cast. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Do you remember the flattened nose? And "clones" (1973). The last two frames are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they are earlier than Clonus. <br /> <br /> There are also several fiction books from previous decades that deal with the idea, although often the word "clone" is not used.
