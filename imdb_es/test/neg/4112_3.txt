I will begin by admitting that I enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site. I find that if I can see what the creators were trying to do, I can appreciate their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack when telling the story. In general, they tried to create an entertaining movie. The plot was invented, but most of the action movie plots are. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but he still holds up as an action leader, considering he is not asked much. The main problem, destroy the whole movie, is the horrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable that animals and funds look so fake. Apart from that, the animal conceptions could have been really good, like the action scenes, but they failed because the production failed. This could have been a really memorable movie if only it had been finished. It really looks like they intended to go back and fix all the horrible CGI, but they ran out of money and they still released him. Save your money because someone failed this movie. I give it three stars because it really could have been good, but it was totally unsuccessful somewhere. I can not say enough.
