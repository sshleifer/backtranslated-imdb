This film is an abortive and inanimate attempt to unite several bad movies and make some kind of extra-bad movie. Fail even on this, since there is too much "plot", and there are not enough ridiculous puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the types of suits do me very well. The performances are, at best, grade C and boring, with special support for the Spec-Ops man who spoke a kind of strange dialect of the East Coast / Venus that was almost impossible to decipher. It's not that you really care what he says, since only the curses are different. Cinematographically, it is not offensive, more or less what you would expect from direct hire dismissals (like the script). The fact that New Concorde has used images from the "Carnosaur" films is offensive and quite confusing. To shame, New Concorde. To shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and somehow they ruined it and made it almost inseparable. Watch the movies of "Carnosaurio" if you want to see the chaos of the dinosaur with less money. <br /> <br /> I give it a star because I really like the movies it steals from me, and also because the scale does not have a zero.
