During filming, was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon? It was as if she was reading from an autocue. I have seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe that was all part of the character? Whatever it was, it was very annoying, I wanted to shake the screen to hurry it. I read the book a long time ago and I did not like it very much, except that Septimus' descent into madness was very well done, but I do not think Rupert Graves showed it very well, his performance was very superficial. The connection between her life and Clarissa's is not very well made either, but I suspect that the attempt is to show the sacrifice that the soldiers made to allow people like Clarissa to continue with their vapid lives. The film is very small and does not have a real unity. I hated it.
