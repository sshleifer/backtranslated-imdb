I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this has been much better (there are signs of it: the dialogue should occur long before the big scenes of f / x (to introduce characters) that would make sense long before, it gets stuck later in time) Perhaps the original script was for a longer execution time. But maybe not, in any case, this sucks. All the characters are not interesting, and "all" speak expositive passages as if they were speaking the word of God. characters that are totally expository: the "Abbot secretary" of Dianne Wiest is simply horrible, explaining things to his assistant (and, indeed, to us), in endless speeches that NO ONE would say to anyone, ever, in real life ( When she is not explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to HER that SHE already knows._ There are characters that are completely one-dimensional: the evil of the power company, the pilot who simply will NOT STOP on his person life and concentrate on your work.The "well-meaning" superdooperuber-hacker-type energy company that can be blocked <br /> <br /> * everything * in Chicago (including phones) - and then gives you the oh -no-what-i-have-i- Speech pronounced (but do not leave a back door?) The cross-reporter who abandons his principles in the blink of an eye? The shift supervisor of the electric company that left his POST in the middle of the worst crisis in Ch icago since the Fire, without consequences? Hospitals ABANDONED by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not kidding, that's in the movie). <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, and it's full of Hollywood moral clich√©s: generally women are good, men are evil, unless you're influenced by a woman (the latest is punk with the gun : deprived of a woman's influence, literally goes crazy); an evil stupid act (like what the journalist did with hacker-bozo) is fine, as long as you "have good intentions". Evil men die, evil capitalist men die as horribly as possible, everyone else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And I heard someone say that the nuclear power stations had to be turned off because there was no electricity to run the security systems (think about that)? <br /> <br /> There's a ray of sunshine (if you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his "Independence Day" character (you know, "Hi guys, I'm crazy!"), this time as a stormy hunter with an infinite range SUV and super-dooper batteries for your camcorders. However, they kill him, mostly, apparently, so that the audience appreciates that tornadoes are quite dangerous things (something superficial, that). <br /> <br /> Give this one a pass.
