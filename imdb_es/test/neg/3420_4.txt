Summary: I'm not entirely familiar with Shakespeare's story of Macbeth, but I think this is quite similar to the original, only established today. Tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valuable hired killer and is in favor of the Duncan leader. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than that, and they plan for Duncan's murder, and any throne competition. This is a story of cold and brutal betrayal and death. <br /> <br /> Comments: A very interesting idea, I must say. To use the story, but change the setting to the current time, but keep the original dialog box (?). It establishes a great contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that keeps, but not in the notion that I imagined. It is very bloody, but the violence is slow. Not only talking figuratively, it is calculated, it is also, but also literally. A lot of action slows down in slow motion and that's what causes the film to get on its knees. <br /> <br /> What could have been a unique force, the contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence. , now it becomes something completely different. Now, both slow the movement with much pain, so much that sometimes it becomes boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Also, I can not understand the context in which the three witches act. Prepared to present time and reality, I think that such magical witchcraft had no place in the film. Apparently he does, but to me it seems completely out of place. It is not a secondary argument, but a complete secondary argument with its own rules, completely different from the rest of the movie. It seems completely out of place. Surely it must have been possible to turn that part into something modern as well. Maybe hallucinations induced by drugs (which I suspect the director insinuates, but then has left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they only bring sections of the film that are clearly next to the story and I just waited for the real movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespeare lovers? <br /> <br /> 4/10
