If you feel that Reshammiya as a singer is too painful to watch on TV, try to watch him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is soft throughout the film and it is very funny to see him perform in demanding and intense scenes. This is far from being a real love story (Teach the spelling, Reshammiya, it is not luv or reeal), and it is completed with him doing a dance of Mithun da, car wrestling scenes, incarcerated Himesh, Himesh accused of murder, he flees from prison, etc ... If you want to laugh, there's nothing like this, especially the scenes where he howls at Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal tinnitus and want to know out of curiosity what can make you two hours of Reshammiya, then do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stop laughing from the beginning to the end The only saving grace that this film has is the cinematography, the places and a couple of songs. Even then, until you are a Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
