I saw this movie in the theater and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, who now gets worse in the sequel, is the biggest intolerance I can not stand. Junior annoyed his father because he would not go to school, which drove his father Ben crazy. Also, the operator of the Crazy Dance ride is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the trip. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer for Junior because she made threatening insults for Junior, which is why I can not tolerate this movie. Even if the film is relaunched again in the cinemas in the extended version, I would still not see this movie because this movie is not something I can tolerate. In fact, it sucks!
