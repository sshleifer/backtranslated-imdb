That's what this movie really takes. A great piece of cheeze. This film is about a duo type of sister and brother type Bonnie and Clyde who creates their own party line to attract their victims, catch them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of getting away with it? Richard Hatch arrives, who introduces himself as a man of the ladies. A true BAD version of a man woman. And he gets involved in finding who is behind all the murders in Los Angeles. Finally, meet a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for fun and fun. But there are parts in this movie that really set me up as the scene with Lief Garret dressed in his mother's wedding dress acting like a ladybug in front of her sister who tells her that he needs her and that he can not live without her and that the Mira gives him a slap in the face dominating him. I can not believe it was Lief! Well, I suppose I could. But it's worth seeing, but only to see one of the worst Garrets movies he made.
