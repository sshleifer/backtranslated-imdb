This was a Hindi movie. Hindi = Horrible. reasons: cheap dialogues, cheap special effects, cheap direction + stretching of a 2 hour film maximum in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... little% %%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specifically for this movie: 1. The dialogues are not fun. They are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay did his best performance for which I admire him, the comedy was not funny at all! I laughed only 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the movie was useless for the history of the second half. The second half was the story / real movie. The first half was past time / accumulation. 3. The characters are not adequately developed at all. Paresh Rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the second half / rest of the movie. We do not really develop any feeling or care for akshay, and govinda. His characters are nothing more stupid. They do not seem to have difficulties in their difficulties. The jokes are fun, but they are not fun in a very serious scene. The characters in the gang and the drug dealers are corny and have been used in the last 20 films. There's nothing new about those characters. Once again, it shows that they are stupid for being funny. however, stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the movie. the only character that made sense was lara dutta with a real story. 4. The special effects were garbage. In the end, people fall off the ladder of a fire truck. You notice that they are not really on the ladder in the air. Second, people begin to fly when the ladder begins to move. ppl can not fly off a ladder when it is moving ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity. 5. The whole movie was dubbed. All the dialogues were recorded after the movie. The lips of the actors are barely synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap, but I can not remember them. Watch this masterpiece of shitty Indian movies from a non-intelligent, even stupid director, and you will agree with my opinion. For people who like Hindi movies, increase their expectations of decent quality in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that not all Hindi movies are bad. I like some I did not like this <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the effort of akshay and lara)
