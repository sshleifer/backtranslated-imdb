The "airport 4" is basically a mess for Universal Studios to try to make a new twist, the supersonic aircraft Concorde, in its "disaster in the sky" formula. <br /> <br /> Spoiled with involuntary humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy pulls his hand out of Concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a missile seeking the heat that follows flight path of the plane, and the simple fact that these mute passengers come back to board the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> It's not really related to the other 'Airport' movies.
