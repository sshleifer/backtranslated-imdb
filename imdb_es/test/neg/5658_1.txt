Nickelodeon has gone to the bathroom. They have children who say things like "Oh my God!" and "We're screwed" <br /> <br /> This program promotes hatred towards people who are not beautiful or who are not in the crowd. He says that sexual promiscuity is fine, having girls drool over guys without shirts. Not to mention the overweight child who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically reject anyone out of the ordinary. Carly's friend, Sam, who can be a lesbian, beats everyone who crosses her path, which says it's okay to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity that nobody should see it! I give it a 0 out of 10 !!!
