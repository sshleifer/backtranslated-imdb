I felt I was seeing an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director filmed it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible script. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting. <br /> <br /> The worst production I have witnessed. A couple of bad effects of CG and then the rest of the movies were spent walking in what looked like a junkyard. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not write movie reviews, but I was moved to warn everyone about this one. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste time with this movie!
