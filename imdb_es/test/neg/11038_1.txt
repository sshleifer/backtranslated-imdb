Let me get this out of the way before destroying this movie: I love the work of Park Chan-Wook's director. While I do not agree with the masses saying he is the best director working in our time, I can not deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In addition, the performance of Min-sik Choi was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously. . . for 1/5 of the execution time, that is. <br /> <br /> Now the bad: the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I will never understand how critics can tear apart a Hollywood box office success for being a cliché, and then talk about movies like Oldboy, which are so unoriginal and clichéd, if not more so. In any case, Oldboy is one of the most generic and non-original films ever conceived. * Spoilers * The man is captive, the man seeks revenge, the man discovers that he had sex with a family member, the life of the man ended. * End of spoilers * In short, this plot has been used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies / books in between. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the great revelation occurs, I laughed out loud. Does that mean that I am a crazy desensitized without emotions as some reviews of this film about people like me say? No. What it means exaggerated plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved it, and Oldboy also proved it. Why can not people think of something really disturbing rather than just spit out the proven clichés masked with elegant camera work and classical music? That brings up the blood / blood issue. In a nutshell, it is not there. The director is too shy to point the camera at the screen when something "bloody" happens, as if we were watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were Anyway, I heard Oldboy call "the most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie in history", but when I saw it I could not see anything even remotely bloody or disturbing. All the "gore" is off the screen, and even then the level of violence is nothing that you have not seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why this even got an R rating confuses me, let alone "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that make Oldboy look cute on all levels when it comes to violence / blood. <br /> <br /> The other great dazzling and cheesy flaw is the main villain. Most of his time on the screen is showing his naked butt to the audience in the comic American Pie-style, but am I supposed to think he's so mean? When he is wearing clothes, his hair is combed back like a bad Asian mix of the villain James Bond plus cheesest mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager who is recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that it made me laugh once more. Seriously, Oldboy made me laugh more than any comedy this year. . . <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who drink a good wine, have no sense of humor and talk about how boring their lives are at dinners. It is for those people who are so trapped in their own ego that they forgot how unoriginal they are and, consequently, they forgot how unoriginal and boring the "movies" (never "movies") are that they enjoy. <br /> <br /> For those people all I can say is this: I like "movies" and also "movies". I like reflective dramas that really say something about the human condition, and I also like the actionless movies that put me in a coma. But the thing is that, for me to like both "movies" and "movies", they have to be original. They have to be something that I have not seen so many times that I lost count of how many times the plot has been used. When something is not original, it is dispensable. If he does exactly what others do, it is forgettable and boring. Before giving Oldboy another perfect score because it "touched" you, maybe you should think of something: would not it be an equally moving movie, but at the same time the original would make you think more? I just want someone other than me to understand. <br /> <br /> In general: Oldboy is forgettable and corny. <br /> <br /> 1/10
