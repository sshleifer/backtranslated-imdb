Supposedly, the director William Shatner had in mind a much more "dark" movie when it came to 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier', but the trials in Paramount, looking at the huge box office receipts received by his forefather full of humor, He insisted that the new movie also has a lot of laughs. So, what we get is possibly the weakest and the dumbest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas in abundance, along with some good ones, and if you are in a charitable mood, you can watch 'The Final Frontier' in the same way that you would with a regular episode of the television series. On the positive side, Laurence Luckenbill is a good actor and offers one of the best performances of 'guest stars' in any Star Trek, either on the big screen or small, with the Commodore Decker by William Windom. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half brother, constantly lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too often. Charles Cooper is also good like the fat old Klingon General Korrd; Too bad that his role is not as big as him. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, because he was willing to blame the incessant nonsense and the not very convincing action scenes directly at his director's feet. The reason is that I always felt that, of all the Trek regulars, Shatner was the least "tuned" with everything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special for its fans. After reading his memoirs of Trek, it is very evident to me that he considered the program as another series of action and adventures that by chance had a science fiction environment. He preferred the vision of Gene Coon to that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work in the popular western series, 'The Wild Wild West'. Shatner also mentioned that one of his favorite episodes of Star Trek was 'A Piece of the Action', a second season foolish episode co-written by Coon. Then, finally, he is given the opportunity to direct a Star Trek feature film, would not Shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-packed film with a lot of ironic humor? Well, someone did it, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' ended up being. Shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of "the cutes." In the opening scene in Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say which is worse, super-cursory special effects or gruesome dialogue. The gossip about the equipment malfunction in the Enterprise has been developed since 'Wrath of Khan' and, therefore, the fifth movie of Trek, have gotten into the ground. He also has the idea of ​​a 'skeleton team'. A new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura, and suffice it to say that one does not exactly feel the flames of passion that burn between the two. It is a meaningless subplot and does not add anything. The climate scene where 'God' is found does not add much; Whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself does not make much sense. (The abilities of the creature "God" seem to vary according to what is needed at this time). About half of this is a tired repetition of the climax of "The Search for Spock." Leonard Nimoy manages to save Spock's integrity, even as he spits out lines such as "Spock", such as "Contrólate, doctor". And DeForest Kelley, as usual, beats Shatner and Nimoy; He really came as an actor in the final films of Trek. So this Trek tour is not terrible, it just is not very good. Before the baton passed to the 'next generation', there was going to be a more original Trek Trek movie, and it was much more suitable for the task than 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'.
