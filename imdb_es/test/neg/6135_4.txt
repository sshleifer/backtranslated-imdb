The army soldier, Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze runner, is attacked for doing audacious tricks without a net and alienating his cohorts of high cables; Meanwhile, there is an elaborate "show camp" for soldiers and Army personnel, and the entire M-G-M studio has appeared to join in the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unctuously), presenting acts like Kay Kyser and His Orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and M-G-M Dancing Girls (who seem to dress like vegetables). Red Skelton is a little sympathetic with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comedies suffer an apparent gap between the artists and the audience (they are very silent until the editor interrupts them to obtain exaggerated reaction reactions). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a night of jumps at Carnegie Hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls "hep"). The production is brilliant, but the manic energy feels false, fabricated. ** since ****
