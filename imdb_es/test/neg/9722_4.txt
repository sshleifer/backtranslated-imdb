The television commercials for this film showed sorcerers hitting a truck head on, then breaking into pieces and reforming on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the general style of the movie was weak. This is the television series "Bewitched" with three children instead of three. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is a fourth unknown member of the clan that is Going out to get them and consolidate all their power. In addition to driving in trucks, these children can fly around the sides of houses, out the windows, push each other in piles of trash and make the veins in their necks open. But if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the children is evidence of this, since he sits in an attic made to look like a mummy but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good wizards are each one of them immensely rich. His own right, completely spoiled, hateful and annoying. In any public school, these children would be beaten every day. Their eyes and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the children in the hood. Unfortunately for all good people, these Charmed boys were sent to the Hogwart School of Reform for sorcerers who could not enter the Harry Potter class. <br /> <br /> So, what was the movie about? Three teenagers acting together and with their girlfriends. Another teenager who envies his power and money and turns out to be a lost relative. After a few scenes where the Charmed show their powers and have sex with their friends; The film arrives at the plot of the revenge of the unknown adolescent sorcerer. Predictable things happen. The evil sorcerer ambushes several friends of the other sorcerers, and eventually begins to attack them as well. The final confrontation happens, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, this is a good movie to watch.
