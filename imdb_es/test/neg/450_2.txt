Every time I see Larry King Live, he throws most of the softball questions for his guests. He rarely receives useful information because he does not ask the difficult questions. This comes from its beginning on the radio. <br /> <br /> King was established on the radio and, basically, has not changed a bit the format for television, except that his talking head is visible. It becomes like a puppy for your guests and the only time you really get useful information from them is when they volunteer it or if the person calling the program really asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a kind and friendly father. Type of interviewer This means that you should not have a prime-time program on an important news network if you consider CNN to be one. I do not do it because of the history of CNN. <br /> <br /> Copy (ie, by cable) The new network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news, as he could broadcast news 24/7. When it began, the only television competition was from NBC, ABC and CBS. Because of this, CNN copied the format of its competition and achieved respectable ratings. <br /> <br /> This worked well for CNN until they obtained competing networks that were innovative and provided better / fresher news coverage. In response to the heating up of the competition, CNN refused and criticized its competitors who were eating their lunch and ratings because CNN wanted to resist the change. This did not work for long and his grades started to plummet. <br /> <br /> Now, Copying News Network is trying to recast itself by reinventing itself and copying the leading news network format. Unfortunately, this show represents a big part of the problem. He is 21 years old and shows his age very badly. <br /> <br /> I regret to say, King needs to be removed from Prime Time or discarded altogether.
