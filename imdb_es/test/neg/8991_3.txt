The film begins in Latvia just after the First World War. As a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was great concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there apparently to protect the interests of their nations. However, sometimes they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, since the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "Whites" win. However, the whites were deeply divided into factions: some wanted the return of a Tsar, others wanted a republic and others wanted something in between. Due to these mixed objectives and the lack of a real commitment on the part of the foreign armies, the whole expedition was condemned and left the USSR after only a year or two. However, what I did NOT know was that the German troops were also involved. This surprised me, since they had just lost World War I and were not in the best shape to mount an expedition of this type. <br /> <br /> This is the backdrop of the film, but it is also a rich pro communist. The lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him several times, but in each case he rejects her. Then, she sublimates these desires for several issues. While none of this sex is so graphic, this and the underlying reason why the man is not interested make this a pretty adult film and it would not show younger audiences. <br /> <br /> While the setup for this movie is interesting, the film in general is as gray and lifeless as the one I've seen. I do not recommend it unless you're an incredibly patient person or you really like overrated German movies. Especially, I warn anyone who suffers from depression, as it will undoubtedly make it worse. The simple fact is that there are many better German films waiting to be seen, such as MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS GOING TO HEAVEN, WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI, FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others)
