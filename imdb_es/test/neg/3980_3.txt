Like most other people, I saw this movie in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it received some deserved comments, it is one of the best films that will be presented in that program. <br /> <br /> The premise is better than even your Hollywood blockbuster average these days; It raises some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes annoying, it also provides some beautiful moments when Richard is walking on the river. By watching the movie, you can see where many plot developments looked great on paper. Richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder, and the ending would probably have been a good mental game of the 70s if the previous issues had not been so foolish. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is Visibly cheap, making the flaws more obvious. The "clone farm" is obviously a university campus, and a can of beer serves as an important point in the plot. Lena and Richard have no chemistry; we are supposed to believe that this is a gathering of likeminded minds, but there does not seem to be a brain cell among them. The "old couple in a bad mood" also becomes very old, very fast. There are also some errors that can be attributed to bad management choices, such as the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> In general, a noble effort, but still it is It looks better in MST3K.
