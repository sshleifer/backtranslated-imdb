Sorry, friends, but all of you who say that this is a great documentary ... and that prize that won at Sundance ... well, everyone has been deceived. I've listened for some years to how I had to watch this documentary and finally I saw it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out, and reality TV did not have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed entertaining. But Mike and Mark are playing so obviously, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are fun and some of the lines seem improvised, but for the most part they do not seem to be true. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but it's set, it's an exaggeration of themselves, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people think it's the real deal. They did not fool me, so it was actually a bit boring. Slightly entertaining, but do not miss much if you miss it.
