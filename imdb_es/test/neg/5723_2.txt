Summary: Ever since Warrior Queen Gedren raised and killed most of Sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, which threatens to destroy the world if it is not destroyed, killing Sonja's sister in the process. Now Sonja is in search of revenge, and to save the world. Along the way, meet the much like Conan (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the infant prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first, Sonja rejects all help, but then she is forced to accept it, and together they will save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you see a movie like this, and you think it's the story that is the best element of this movie, the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength to good fighting with swords and effects, and 2) the story is really bad. It is simple, uncomplicated and does not really offer anything in terms of character development or even suspense. It's predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry at all. And the child is just annoying. And most of the scenes are so long that they become boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill your time. And so we return to point 1). The fight is slow, uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows that most fighters clearly block the opponent's blows long before the opponent has begun to hit. In my sincere opinion, I think that most children, fighting with sticks, create more exciting fights by playing knights than this movie. In general, this is a really bad split, which should be avoided by everyone who liked Conan's movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
