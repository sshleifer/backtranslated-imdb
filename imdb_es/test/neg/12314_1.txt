The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold and humid day. <br /> <br /> "The Cat in the Hat" was the name of the movie. , and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played Cat, his mood was sparse, and children do not need to see this, the humor was not docile. <br /> <The movie was like drinking milk from a rabid cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. <br /> <br /> This movie, in short, is atrocious. The acting was bad, the plot was modified too, and the humor was surprisingly very crude. <br /> <br /> Start with Conrad and Sally, a breaker of rules and a future sheriff. When her mother has to go to work, she has Ms. Kwan take care of the children. Possibly the only fun part of the movie is when Ms. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, at C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat. <br /> <br /> The movie starts to get out of control. The cat came to try to let the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, which suddenly begin to destroy the house. Improvises a television infomercial and accidentally cuts its tail. And when the cat fills Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Possibly his only fun disguise is as a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn children about the Cat. <br /> <br /> Too bad he did not warn us that this movie was as fun as sour milk, or cut off your tail. <br /> Soon the children are out looking for the family dog, which has the key to a box on its collar. If the box is not locked soon, your house will be the home of the Cat's universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance, in general, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers to the Cat, saying things like "You dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a blow to the testicles while posing as a pi√±ata . Spencer Breslin is great as Conrad, who makes the problems, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, but by themselves they are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection that hopes to kill John Ritter (the accident is waiting to happen). Lawrence Quinn, Alec Baldwin's sneaky and slender, is disgusting, always trying to attract the children's mom, which is played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, mom's boss, and he's also the voice of the fish. The last three are also insipid. <br /> <br /> In general, if I were a father, I would not like my children to be interested in humor, because there is a lot of that and much more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As the great Dr. Seuss once said: <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Really, universal, for! Theodore is already stirring in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says: "Curiosity killed the cat" .- The Cat In The Hat * of *****
