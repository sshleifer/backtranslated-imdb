This film would have been fine, in fact probably excellent, if the directors had left the interviews and the images of the concert separately. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate the way it cuts into the best part to go to an interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the movie, or located in a special feature. The best part of the concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put on and just stop playing because the music is interrupted continuously. However, there are some strengths of this movie; The images of the concert, when played, is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long break without Osbourne and this film captures that well: Sabbath basically makes the fans vibrate. Fans, of course, have a sweet edge in the movie because they are watching the band live, of course, but they also do not have to endure the incessant interviews with which the DVD viewers are loaded. What a shame with Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this in the movie! Also, shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the movie that way.
