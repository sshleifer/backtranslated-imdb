I can not believe that I have set up a "seasonal pass" on my TiVo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something like that ... although I can not imagine it. After watching about 5 minutes, I thought to myself ... why am I seeing this? It's definitely not reality, and it's one of the worst performances I've seen on television. I'm a total addict to reality TV and there's nothing. Real about this THE PERFORMANCE ... (if you can call it that) is horrible ... The only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are destined to attract spectators to the show ... although they should be much prettier to save This train collision ... if they had more lines, they would probably change their minds as they probably do not have any talent either. Obviously, this is a very low budget production with "actors" that are apparently very cheap. There's no way they can get a job on something else. Someone needs to direct these people to a job in the food service ... Maybe they could do that. Oh, and by the way, Parco P.I. no longer occupies any space on my TiVo or TiVo season pass list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
