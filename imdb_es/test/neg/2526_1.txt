A root canal without anesthesia is more fun. This movie is disturbing and meaningless. There is absolutely nothing believable in any of these characters or in the plot line. What the hell were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie? The acting in this movie is incredibly bad, even from actors who are usually very good. "The In-laws" is a fun movie. "The Birdcage" is a hilarious movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous movie. This movie is just silly. I can not even begin to understand the kind of sick mind that is needed to write the "novel" on which this film is based. Honestly, I can not think of one nice thing to say about this movie. It just does not make any sense. People please, I beg you, do not watch this movie. You will regret for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst that has ever been made, but it is definitely at the top of the list.
