Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Less than 50 billion of 10. If you want a hard action do not rent it! If you want a good independent movie, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought I would see Burt Reynolds in such a horrible movie. It has the thinnest plot in history. Van Damm films should win an Academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe, once again, shows why he is not the most popular actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have been a better drug addict than him. I do not want to bore you with more facts about this fucking movie, except to say it's better to rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point, if you get my drift. <br /> <br />
