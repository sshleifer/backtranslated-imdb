I watched this movie for the first time the other day and I got bored to tears. I guess I was just looking for a flashback of the wonderful series I remembered. I watched the TV show The Mod Squad religiously on the day and it was fantastic. He was full of action and the relationship that the 3 had with Greer was attractive. There was nothing like that here. When they murdered Greer, you have the idea that these 3 would not have mattered. The actor who played Pete is really a good actor, but they wrote his part as if it were a mental challenge. Pete in the television series was quiet and serious, but he also had a fun side. They had this guy acting like he was drugged, drunk or just plain ignorant. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the television series. It will be a complete disappointment.
