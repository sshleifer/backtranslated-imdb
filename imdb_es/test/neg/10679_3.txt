Like all the cast and crew know all about making movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the adventures and problems of a murderous cockney vampire, and an old spit with her seemingly jaded vampire. lover. That plot itself stinks of clichés and promises boredom when it comes to a movie as small as this one, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that I do not discard movies because they are B movies, in fact, some of my favorite movies are B movies like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but it loses the mark by one mile . <br /> <br /> Anyone with some knowledge of low budget films Know that acting is rarely exciting and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a completely new dimension of silencing it on the screen. Some of the so-called acts are simply indescribably bad, with characters that throw out liners that fall, and speeches that express as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of tranquilizers for horses. <br /> <br /> A vast part of the film is also occupied by the vampire characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily shaking the mouth, showing off his ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very strongly. Literally, it must happen in almost every scene at least once, and it quickly became annoying and useless, as if those looks of supposedly fearsome vampire faces were used simply to fill a little time and eliminate the rest of this turd sandwich from a movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what other critics believe here, I think this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this movie seriously in many places. The large amount of excessively dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups tell me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate in its genre and not falsify it, and it fails miserably. Attempts of supposedly tasteful sex scenes appear as comical and silly, and the action sequences are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> Also the end of this movie was one of the weakest and pathetic conclusions I've seen. A movie, B movie or not. When movies like this force you to spend hours and hours just to be rewarded with an "oh, it was all a game", and the ending is really disgusting. The conclusion of the "plot" feels like an idea of ​​the director who realized the last day of filming because they had reached the end of their limited budget. <br /> <br /> But I have not qualified this film as a star despite the overwhelming stupidity, and this is due to the only positive point that I can really give to this film. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure that the parts that I found comical were not meant to be, and I found that most of the efforts made by the genuine gags were unsuccessful, but when you look with friends, it's a good movie to get the mickey out.
