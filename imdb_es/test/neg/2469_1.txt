Two dead graceless girls remain in Uncle Benny's beach house, his infamous death. Uncle Beeny does not like the party. But guess that? The deadly graceless girls have one, yes, you guessed it, a party on the beach without mortal grace. If you did not get the not so subliminal message that I'm trying to convey. First of all, you're an imbecile. I'd rather see a naked gelatin tag team watching a match between Bea Aurther and Cameryn Manhiem VS. Rosie O'Donnell and Jessica Tandy. This movie, and I lose the term loosely, is that bad. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kristin Novak and topless Charity Rahmer, Iva Singer shows breasts and buns
