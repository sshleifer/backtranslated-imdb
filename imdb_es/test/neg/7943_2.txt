This movie definitely made me laugh, but that does not mean it was exactly funny. Well, once again, my friends and I have a lot of fun watching it. <br /> <br /> I doubt there's anything in this movie that has not been done at least twice before, like in the plot itself. All the characters are clich√© cardboard box papers from overused movies that do not require acting skills; consequently, such skills are not delivered. We have the corrupt policeman, a ruthless murderer who says he cares about his men and their families, but he does not care about the people he shoots in the forehead at a range so close that he can get blood on his face. We have the "policeman spent on the edge" very well indicated in the discussion forums of this film; we have the old policeman on a day of retirement that almost everyone should have identified immediately as the most likely man inside, since he had a lot to gain and did not utter a reliable word throughout the film. How to see through a glass house on a sunny day. The great black gangster king was a copy of all the previous great black gangster kings in the history of cinema (they could have simply called him Marcellus Wallace), but a little harder and more ruthless, because something has to point out that we also know Laurence Fishburne In Actually good movies. Then, finally, we have a HIGHLY EDUCATED doctor who can not think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from his ordinary life and he spends most of the movie sitting in a corner trying to figure out how to stay. The weapon they gave him. DO NOT USE IT <br /> <br /> The whole history of the siege is not interesting, it is not original (it was used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting. There is the initial probe, then the placement of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. Meanwhile, a lot of frightened, stressed and scared policemen and thugs manage to stop a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the rather important advantage of VISION. Then, again, in the deep night, with the power cut and a snowstorm in the sky, there's definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision. <br /> <br /> But the best thing is that it comes right at the end. In the first scenes that show Precinct 13, we see that it is located on the outskirts of an industrial city; Factories and office buildings surround it everywhere. From this point, the besieged walk a hundred meters in a culvert and where do they end up? An alley that ends right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where did that forest come from? Who decided to place a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes within the forest it looked deceptively FLAT? <br /> <br /> From here I leave you the judgment, and your common sense. Go see this movie if you're looking for a good unintentional laugh, I can really recommend it.
