Have you ever wondered why these guys (Seagal, Stallone, Willis and others) manage to survive all those shootings in which they are outnumbered? I think I have it solved. The enemies always fail, and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a gun and overcomes half a dozen heavy shots from a few feet away. One of the heavy ones has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It really does not matter. There could be a thousand shotguns shooting at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, forget it. The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or with a blunt object, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever, leaves them aside with a few derogatory blows. Not only is he a master of these strange abilities, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once, he breaks someone's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. One breaks the spine of a man on his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I get into the spirit of the movie here because Seagal uses that line, "I'll tell you something," several times, along with "What's that supposed to mean?"). These guys deserve extinction. Any good Xenophobe manual. They are all black, they speak with an unintelligible Jah-MAYO accent, they wear dreadlocks that seem to need a shampoo, they torture and assassinate with aplomb, and here is the worst part. They are not Christians. It's okay. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> Actually, the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the movie. They got the components of the ritual quite well: cigar smoke, rum spitting, sacrificial chicken. They only left out the dance of possession in which the spirit assembles the dancer. They should have read Metraux in Voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot adheres to the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by the voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is made here to a friend of Seagal. What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "McQ" is made here to Seagal himself. At the opening of the film, when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his career at the DEA, he is now happily retired, and when we introduced ourselves to his friends and family, I tried to keep a record of his affiliates for see them. If I could choose which ones would be horribly killed or mutilated to generate their search for revenge. <br /> <br /> Acting does not really require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican policeman, played by Tom Wright, is really good. Wright has a considerable range. Here, he is an associate of dubious loyalty, rather sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars" has a comic part that plays to perfection. <br /> <br /> The Jamaicans never flew like movie villains. I do not know why exactly. It is a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica, stay in Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavy, and if you're in the mood for another typical standard action movie, this should be a satisfying view.
