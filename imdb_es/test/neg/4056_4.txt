The softcore has nothing wrong, but this is quite clinical: a lot of nudity but everything is false (of course, it's always false, it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, everything is random nudity and bad acting of "lust" and sex between them. <br /> <br /> Part of this is, of course, your personal preference. These women clearly have some bodily problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicone, not to mention their appearance too plastic and leathery, so if that's your thing, great, you can see all that here. <br /> <br /> I do not I do not think anyone's expectations are very high when you watch a movie title like this, but for many people, it would be a lot like looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost look real but in actually they are more creepy.
