When I first saw this movie, I did not know the title of it. I realized that I had Chevy Chase with the same name I had in Caddyshack, so I had an idea that it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I discovered it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie with another title, but do not call it Caddyshack 2. You give that great movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter when I first saw her looked like her wife. How old is this girl? Geez, what about making this movie a little believable. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
