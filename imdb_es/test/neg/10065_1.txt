The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the most false excuses of a movie that I have not yet found. I would have to search far and wide to find anything that approximates the level of ineptitude shown in this movie. Acting ?? Bad. Editing ?? Bad. Address ?? Bad. Special effects ?? Bad and laughable Plot ?? Bad. Illumination ?? Bad. Cinematography? Bad. Costume Design ?? Bad and silly Everything else ?? Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is as fun as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real resistance test. This is one of Lou Ferrigno's masochists or completistas (if they exist). <br /> <br /> Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you do not have the budget for real special effects, I rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. It will look great, trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are on a quest to recover the rays of Zeus, take some time to make frequent stops to oil your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two partners at Amazon. <br /> <br /> 3. Any fight with swords, use of magic and almost all other day-to-day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to that of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed as Star Wars extras. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to fill in the runtime of your fucking movie, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek-style credits and add great grandiose music. It also helps if you have a previous movie to extract scenes from. <br /> <br /> 6. The battle scenes advance much more smoothly if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did anything for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I did not think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film, Hercules (1983), look like an Academy Award winner.
