This whole movie is so terrible that it is a complete disaster. The story is so stupid that I can not believe that someone really sat and wrote about this and thought it would be a good movie! The performance is possibly the worst of all the b series movies ever made. I've seen a lot of type b science fiction movies before and some of them are really good, some of them, like From Venus, should never have been done. <br /> <br /> Some movie makers think that just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie store, that they have achieved something: that it is good and that people should see it. This is not always true, and definitely not from From Venus. This film loses in all accounts: horrible acting, stupid plot, very weak special effects, uglier costumes, unrealistic dialogues, bad direction, etc. You can only say that this movie only took about $ 20 to make, and I can be giving it too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this train of a movie for your own good!
