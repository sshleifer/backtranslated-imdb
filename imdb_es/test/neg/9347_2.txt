After missing these countless times at TCM UK, I decided to check it out because of its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree: I knew a completely silly trip awaited me, but it was also amazingly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script starts many sci-fi titles of the recent era: SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976), to the extent that it was filmed in some of the same sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but not very attractive: from the title it can be deduced that water is scarce in the planet where all this happens, so our buccaneer heroes are in charge of stealing ice. A blocks from the tyrant tyrants (!) Rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the deposed king; by the way, the cast includes another famous pup: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate bands. Fortunately, the actress's mistake in accepting such a role will soon forget her when she wins an Oscar. The guide of his father, nothing less than for the HONOR OF PRIZZI (1985). As STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the "Supreme Commander", the filmmakers chose to have their own screen legend: 78-year-old John Carradine (who has been tied to a kind of operating table during his brief scene! ). <br /> <br /> The most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: the extraterrestrial using the toilet; the castration machine the clumsy antics (even the karate-style combat!) of the inevitable robot companions; the silly make-up of slaves / eunuchs used at one point by the heroes; the recurrent attacks of "space lovers" (whatever that may be); the climax in which the characters grow old as they traverse a curve of time (Crosby becomes pregnant, gives birth and sees her son grow in 30 seconds, while leader Robert Urich is replaced by John Ford Stalwart. Hank Worden for this scene!) - by the way, the jump cuts adopted here (with the intention of denoting the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful, but they are downright irritating.
