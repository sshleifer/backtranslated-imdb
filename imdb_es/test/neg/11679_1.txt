This film is supposed to be about three young idealists, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. Actually it's just another movie about some rich and beautiful people trying to decide who they should go to bed next; The peasants and Naxalites and the political struggles of the time simply serve as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we do not hear the villagers say a word, it does not matter to learn anyone's name, therefore, they occupy the same "role" as the "natives" in old Hollywood movies. The movie is also boring, and the story does not take us anywhere, except to several rooms. We are supposed to admire the ingenuity of all this, which simply means that there is not a good song and a dance routine, which would not have saved the film, of course, but at least it could have alleviated the boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was upset by the immorality of the whole story, not because of the little bit of the bedroom but because of the uselessness of the story. The message seems to be that it is not worth pursuing ideals.
