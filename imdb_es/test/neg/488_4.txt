This short was the last and only Shemp of the director Del Lord. The problem: it was quite weak and the coffee scene was more or less a carbon copy of a "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was quite fun, and the initial part of the coffee part. But there are many bumps in this short. For example, why are the puppets hiding in the dumpster when the police arrive? In the remake, "Of Cash And Hash" (1955), the director Jules White fixes this and the reason why the crazies hide in the trash can is because there is a shooting between the police and the thieves of armored vehicles. The scene in which Moe is having problems with the oyster was done before with Curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The part of the spooky house was not so good, except for the hilarious scene outside the ghostly house. To make matters worse, the end did not have any problem. Score: C-
