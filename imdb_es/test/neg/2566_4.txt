I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and I thought it could be a real action thriller. No, it's a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is definitely a cable movie and not one for the theater. Fortunately, after 90 minutes, the movie stops, otherwise, the public should have taken an anti-sleep antivirus. One thing came close: it was the beautiful country where the film was filmed. You can really feel the American air but that's it. I hope for Steven Seagal to finally succeed in a great success. It is not a must because I and my wife voted an average of 4/10.
