Explore the borders of extreme boredom. Life in a small Canadian town in winter as an experiment of extreme sensory deprivation. Absolutely nothing happens as seen through the eyes of a protagonist in white, expressionless, totally disinterested. The spectators of this film must be prepared to hallucinate in the style of "altered States". <br /> <br /> In an innovative study, David Snowden discovered that he could predict Alzheimer's disease thirty years in advance by comparing nuns' autobiographical essays. Upon entering the convent. Those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose. The essays were calm and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy. <br /> <br /> Now, why did I mention that? Perhaps, my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable, autobiographical and contemplative film that shows, in a simple and direct style, the somber and stoic life of a small community, which lives next to giant debris of asbestos. <br /> <br /> This film became popular at the height of the Quebec separatist movement due to its presentation of this community as permanently injured victims. Tragically, his writer-director was soon diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide.
