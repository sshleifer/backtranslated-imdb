A placid New York lawyer (George Segal) is slowly going crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would NEVER send his senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later he is taking care of a senile and dangerous psychopath. Meet a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and fall in love. But his mother continues to scare her. Segal is ready to kill her ... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... THIS is a comedy? I have nothing against black humor, but come on ... there must be some limits! This movie does everything it can to throw every sickly joke that you can imagine and rub your face into it. Pity that none of the jokes is funny. The jokes involve rape, nakedness, public humiliation, senile old people, insults and racism. Basically, this is a movie that thinks it is smart to try to surprise people and think they will laugh at it. I was disgusted and I did not laugh once. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast is the only thing that kept me watching. Segal and Gordon were wonderful in their roles, especially Gordon. And Van Devere is also pretty good. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not fun) was a useless scene in the courtroom with Rob Reiner Jr. (and try to see his then wife, Penny Marshall, as a spectator). -The original ending made Segal sleep with his MOTHER and pretend he's dad! That was (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> A real bad and sick movie. Bottom of the canyon. I give him a 1.
