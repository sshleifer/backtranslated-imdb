The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed movie. In addition, the original release, the "long version" was recently shown at TCM, exposing the film, probably, to its largest audience. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie when it first appeared on a full screen at a 3rd Avenue movie theater across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and he retired the following Wednesday. Maybe it was not a fair release, but it was and it's a terrible movie. Seeing the full version, I recently confirmed that judgment and with thirty years of experience watching and writing about movies, I can better explain why. <br /> <br /> First there is the dreaded phrase "mise-en-scene" whose definition is at the same time so simple but so amorphous that it baffles even after being defined. It's basically everything that happens in front of a camera. For example, an additional crowd will be given an action, for example, simply walking down the sidewalk and a place to start. When the assistant director shouts action, the extra will go through his action. If there is another take, the extra will return to the starting point and return to "Action". All the extras do this. Then say that a taxi drives to the sidewalk and the star comes out and hugs another manager, while the extras in the crowd are doing their thing. This is a staging. In the theater they call it a blockade, but cinema is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of defining the staging is due to the fact that when French critics developed their theory of the author in reverse of an author. He was a metier-en-scene, even more contemptuously known as a "traffic cop." An author was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and, through the body of work of the director, a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a man of company who represented in a film what had been delivered to him on paper. It is the difference between, for example, John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, took over as director of films. Cimino first gained prominence in directing the first million-dollar television commercial. This represented a Chevrolet floating on the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears in any of the best television commercials of all time and it is remarkable only for how expensive it was and how exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three-year-old girl carried out to entertain the company, who gets her biggest response when she throws her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old boy, embarrassing for a thirty year old boy. So Cimino was praised from the beginning for spending a large amount of money for a superior image and thus learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic car that drives from one side to another, from one side to another, until it leaves from the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits that proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, had not intervened, the scene would have lasted until all the rabbits had been killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I suppose if you see the movie on a fragmented DVD as a miniseries, it can be impressive. This is because the scenes are directed with such a dense staging that each scene is like an encyclopedia, it is simply exhausting to sit for almost four hours. It's like sex, at some point it simply becomes a scourge. There are 40 minutes of opening, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed in Oxford, it is a kind of non-secuitur. Personally, I prefer the artistic way of developing a story instead of the more commercial _ "Now I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you" of most of the films. However, the entire preface adds up to a single line: Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later? All that time, money and effort, not to mention all the attention and energy of the public just to provide this information almost useless. <br /> <br /> Then there's the street scene between Kristofferson and Masur, which just goes on and on with a city populated with background extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to offer a bit of information of exposition. It is so exhausting. There is only one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty-pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible and ingenious dialogues, which continue and are exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, any scene taken out looks brilliant. In general, it is a rich piece to spin articles worthy of praise. Seen in shots with the ability to quickly move through the boring drill bits or turn it off if it feels shaken on stage, it is basically painless. But do not let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw him in 1980, there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene in which Kris Kristofferson is riding his horse and turns to one side and then the other, and does it about six times. "That's symbolic," he said, "that he does not know which way to go." That's basically, at its core, the basis of every critique in favor of Heaven's Gate. <br /> <br /> Look at it, if you must, but be careful, this is not a movie whose time has come, this is a Stinker that will smell forever. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.
