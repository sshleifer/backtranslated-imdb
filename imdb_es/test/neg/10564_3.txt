Okay, when I say "wow", I mean, "Jesus, please, help me." I have an old copy on VHS that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The film is about an extraterrestrial landing on Earth to terrorize us with a weapon that makes people fall into oblivion. WATCH OUT!!! And with that, I mean be careful with those special effects. There is an amazing amount of errors. The acting is terrible, but I would say that the only one who is making an effort is the Sheriff. The film itself is really grainy and poorly lit. In one particular scene, it's a day outside and then the shot shows the Night Beast firing his weapon with the night behind him. Then show the day again. * Shake the head * Normally I like low-budget horror movies, but I had to force myself to finish them because I never see a movie without finishing it. The only achievement that this film achieved was an extraterrestrial that was not stereotyped. So for that, and ONLY for that ... I give it a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you've had a bad day. You will be even more depressed by the failed attempt that this movie makes.
