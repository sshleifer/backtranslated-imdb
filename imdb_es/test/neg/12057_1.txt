How to round up all the clichés and possible stereotypes that exist in the horror genre and, later, group them in a massively bad movie? The answer: "Camp Blood". This is an amateur nonsense made by micro budget and a little too obvious, inspired by the "Friday the 13th". Four of the most intolerable teen characters you'll ever see? Are they like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying? go camping and quickly find themselves chased by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit. Do not even ask me what the killer's motivations were or even who he was, because if he appeared in the movie, I lost it completely. This is one of the worst movies that have been made, without inspiration or craftsmanship. The values ​​of production were so lamentable that there are actors who play multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. The only decent and worthwhile middle sequence throughout "Camp Blood" is the opening in which the stunning and voluptuous Meredith O'Brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout. Yes, I am fully aware that it is a totally superficial comment, but, again, it is a juvenile and delayed film, who cares?
