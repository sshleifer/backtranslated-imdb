The script is the worst part of this movie, as it moves from one premise to another, losing all the important fragments that would have made a series of different stories possible. (This movie is confusing, because the audience does not know what the story is). I had no problem with the low production values ​​and the performance was not excellent, but this is tele, so it was fine. I do not care if some scenes seemed to have ended in one shot. But having such an unsound script is completely unnecessary. Did any executive read it before disbursing the cash? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue in particular was so badly written that I needed a voiceover to complete all the details that had been left out. The prologue was hurried, it was not clear what was happening, that is. The Russian Revolution was reduced to "Some riots are happening in Petersburg," with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution, so I could complete the details, "those annoying communists." The prologue is better ignored. <br /> <br /> This could have been a careful study of a person who is confused about who she is. Establishes this premise in the asylum. Then I could have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the movie. No. He left. The film assumes that she is who she claims to be (although there is no empirical evidence). It establishes a melodramatic romance, a love so strong that it will believe everything it says. It's fine, a soppy romance. No, because it does not make sense. The love interest seems a crazed (and by the way, sordid) lunatic who explodes in wild gestures. This does not work either, because the movie stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Even though there were many love scenes, I never convinced myself of the reason why they were in love. It seems to me that com romances are more convincing, even though there are only one or two scenes that state that they have even spent some time together. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thriller-type movie in which the film assumes that she is who she claims to be, and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the court case is summarized instead of treated. The strange voiceover comes back, again to complete the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The most fun to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a crazy woman who went to America and married another crazy woman and they did crazy things together. Throughout his life, he had episodes of lunatic behavior. None of this in the movie either. There is a really annoying character in the asylum that emerges out of nowhere and announces herself as an informant of the type "Someone flew over the next cuckoo /" Twelve monkeys. "Fortunately, she disappears, having contributed nothing to the story .
