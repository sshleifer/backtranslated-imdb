In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is looking for an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some photos and letters of his old lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, the phone hangs up and the annoying and loving Carla has a brief relationship with Moira and has sex with an acquaintance at a party. When Matteo arrives in London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and behavior. <br /> <br /> "Transgredire" is another "soft pornography" of the sick director Tinto Brass with little depth and a ridiculous story where each situation is a reason to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. The amateur camera exposes the body of the beautiful Yuliya Mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is mistreated, touched and licked in every part of her beautiful body, but without showing an explicit penetration. This film is only recommended to the fans of this director and as a voyeur experience to see Yuliya Mayarchuk nude in erotic situations. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pervertida" ("The Pervert")
