A good cast ... A good idea, but it turns out to be wrong, since hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in court. So many good actors and everyone is acting so bad! So, why did everyone feel attracted to this disaster ... And yes, it has its good points like lighting, etc ... But in the end I asked myself two things ... How could so much talent lead to such a disaster? strange? What is that accent that Nigel Hawthorne is putting? He is / was a great actor and what is that accent about? Is it impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe it's his subtle indication as if he were telling us: 'I got involved with a turkey, so here's a shitty accent to go with it!'
