It is hard to make a negative statement here after all this fuss about how excellent the fact poll is, how wonderful the actors did, and so on. I did not like the movie. It is awful! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister sex, brother-brother sex, sex in drugs, sex without drugs , sex, sex, sex seems to rule your world, I guess the director desperately needs a place to fuck, the story is dirty and shameful, I wonder what made those people get up with this story. : Who cares? <br /> <br /> technical things did not satisfy me too.The sound is poor, just as the editing and "direction" is absent.the actors are well admitted, but guess what It's your job! Your job is to act! There's no need to jump out of your seats if an actor did a decent job.Do you get applauded when a bus driver takes you home safely? See? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all this I had something I can not put into words b charm of the movie? What fun? Nudity? I do not know.
