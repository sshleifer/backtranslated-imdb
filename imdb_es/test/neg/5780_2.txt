Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and attractive woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies in which I've seen her, she seems to me exactly the same character. Either in THE DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! She is always (does she play?) The good-hearted young woman, who is a little naive and does not know how to handle the things that happen to her. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions with which she works abundantly. Personally, I find it hard to believe that she can play a mysterious character and a little unpleasant because she is simply not here. So she's pigeon-holed like the good girl next door, which she is, but, once again, she's not up to the task when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: The same! The movie: frankly stupid. Since it was an American movie, it would have been a great role for Adam Sandler, who I do not like either. I was not offended by the fact that this is a movie with disabled people, I just thought that the jokes resulting from this were not funny at all. I laughed two or three times, but when I was halfway there, I was bored and upset and wanted this movie to end.
