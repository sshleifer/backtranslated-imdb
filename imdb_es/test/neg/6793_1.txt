This show is the worst show of all! Norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc. The only reason I see it is because my ridiculous wife likes it. How many times can Norris fly through the air from a single sight to launch a kick at an obviously blind villain? There are no trees, there is no building, only whoosh ..... pure air. ALWAYS solve the case or is the best in whatever skill there is. No co star ever gets the glory. It's all Norris. It is really evident that Norris is terribly stuck in himself and will not allow anyone to upload him in any scene regardless of content. Terrible performance, terrible script, terrible series.
