This shit does not deserve a critical review, so I will write information for those who do not know the background of this film. First, it is not the first Saudi film, they used this incorrect information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Second, they did it for money, not for anything else, so they chose the imbecile (Hesham) who won Star Academy (as Big Brother). It is a popular spectacle and the imbecile Hesham is popular but silly, cheesy and without talent, then he chose the famous Kuwaiti actor. Mohammed Al Sairafi (also silly and without talent) but has a popular (however, count how many times I will use the word "popular" and then send me an email to get your prize). The popular show and the Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan appeared. in the POPULAR comics show CBM (unfunny) so she is famous * PoPular! Then they chose some Saudi actors for ... blah blah blah. The funny thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I think the identity of the film is the identity of its director). Wait a minute! The screen was written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very horrible!) With the help of a Lebanese critic (famous as a critic, but in reality he is a money collector!). This group of multiple races (slaves of money) does not know anything about the Saudi culture, it does not represent it, but when we know who is behind this garbage, all our questions will be released! Waleed bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about the Saudi culture or the Saudis who does not even live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives, he will live in his own world, his world is far away) away from the Real world, the world of people, so he knows nothing and cares nothing, except for his infinite fortune. <br /> <br /> * It's not a Saudi movie (it's nothing about a movie). <br /> <br /> Screw them all. <br /> <br /> Beep of 10!
