My roommate and I have another friend who works on a local Blockbuster video. Find really horrible movies for us and tell us about them. One of them was a movie of "The horror of Christmas", starring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as a murderer Satna Claus. We did not see it immediately, but we did not think there could be anything worse. Apparently, we were wrong. We were shown this movie "starring" by Ken Shamrock against a murderous scarecrow. At first we thought Ken would really be the killer scarecrow, and that's why we wanted to see him, but he was not, and that made the movie even worse. What absolutely RUINED the movie was the teenage drama. If you want to prevent your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
