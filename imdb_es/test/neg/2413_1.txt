So I give it a star for its true quality, but I give it an eight and a half for pure fun. "Young Warriors," an incredibly bizarre hybrid of sexual comedy and suspense thrillers, is the kind of bad movie you would normally expect to find when you rogues on the edge of the video, though they rarely do. Start with a half hour of extravagant hi-jinx, sexual jokes and youthful shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that must be seen to not be believed). Then, the minor sister of the main character is raped by a group of morbid motorcyclists (an objectionable scene that prevents me from giving this value a 10 for entertainment value, rape is not entertainment!), And the main character receives the rest from his crazed frenzy Brothers who help him in a quest to clean up the city, find the responsible cyclists and kill anyone who is a little criminal they find on the road. <br /> <br /> It's hilarious, uninterrupted fun, apart from the nasty rape scene, and is essential for any movie fanatic. Trust me: I have dedicated my time to these things and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a big blinking slo-mo shootout at a shoddy bar (with a photo of a guy blowing his own foot that's pretty impressive), a couple of decent actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a pair of semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, the queen of the scream Linnea Quigley) and a couple of relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris's brother, Mike, member of the clan Van Patten, James ). He even has one of those big "What have we become?" write the end of the morality lesson, although the tipping point occurs when the fratboys watch a couple of children rob a store with a toy gun. I've always wondered why that was the catalyst that made the hero think; after all, if they were children and not hardened criminals, and if they had a real weapon or not, they were actually stealing a store, so I can say, it was just another job well done for our watchman brotherhood, right? Wonderful things Highly recommended, but do not blame me when you enjoy it in spite of yourself.
