Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charms. This movie does not do it. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man of all Austen's canon (unless Mr. Knightley of Emma has a privileged place) is made to be a creature without heart and mercenary. One or two totally strange characters are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversion looms over everything. I felt very disappointed when I first saw it in 1986; Even today it occupies a prominent place in the list of films that dishonor the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this a broad detour. It has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
