I just saw what way to the front? In TCM (United Kingdom) is a really horrible movie. If I had paid for the photos, I would have left. <br /> <br /> The terrible disaster of a movie. Byers (Lewis) and his companions walk in discarded uniforms from an Italian sci-fi movie of the 1960s. Were the insignia of the CND / peace symbol in the uniforms meant to be ironic? The sets were pure in 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood television could have provided a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The film is full of racism. The movie takes away the mickey from the veterans. <br /> <br /> It's not funny how Lewis has to make a movie to outdo me.
