A sadly predictable story and clich√© about a woman who was not better than she should have been. Sadly, too, the script is by the great experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original of the exotic Frenchman Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative and carefree Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) lifts her from the cigarette factory, but she abandons him. He warns his tall and young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. After a duel, Concha reproaches to Pasqualito the attempt to kill the only man that mattered to him, so he does not: he points his pistol at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young victor, she returns with the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected bit of Edward Everett Horton as Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spanish woman moving constantly, wriggling her waist and posing and then wriggling backwards, flying, shaking her head and so on. And she makes faces, and she has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photograph is strangely crowded: you can not shoot any outdoor scene, except through a tangle of bare trees, you can not shoot any interior scene without so many details so busy that it is almost impossible to follow the people who move to Through a room, no consecutive Dietrich scene can be Shot without major costume change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers that it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
