I ordered this movie on the Internet, since it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard a lot about my friends' TV shows and practically everyone in Turkey, I expected to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> My husband and I (who are fans of any movie with a bit of Turkish scenery and Turkish dialogues in it) just saw it because we had paid $ 20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while at other times underestimated. The plot was not only confusing, but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using a bit of toilet humor in the script to make 'Hollywood' not work for me either. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost too stereotyped that they were neither funny nor realistic and, as another user mentioned, Turkish customs and lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The movements of the camera did not matter. Adding some Dervishes (never seen in them in Kapadokya by the way) and broken plates (Greek style) only made the film even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. Surely there are worthy movies made by Turkish directors that deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 out of 10.
