This film earns 3 for poor quality, poor technical merit and continuity problems. Some people have given this movie a 10, and maybe that's fine if you're just writing it down for its fun factor. However, technically this is a series of inept films from beginning to end, produced by writers, actors and third-category equipment. That was really true in almost all the series because they were intended as low-key entertainment especially aimed at children. And there's nothing wrong with that, but "high art" is not! Spy Smasher gets a lower score than the average compared to other series because it is of even inferior quality and has MAIN continuity problems, even for a series. It was common for a series to have a "cliff suspension," that is, a moment at the end of the episode that seemed as if the good man died but miraculously survived when the next episode began. BUT, in this movie, it is much more unpleasant and ridiculous. You literally SEE the hero die in the last episode, but in the next, they filmed the scene again and showed that they did NOT actually die (although they clearly showed him that he bought the farm in the last episode)! Again and again in SPY SMASHER seems to die, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and somehow prevented death, even if it fell 1500 feet into a river, it fell into a mountain range or whatever. <Br /> <br /> Watch this movie not because of its quality, but because of a good laugh or to learn what it was like to go to the movies on Saturday mornings decades ago.
