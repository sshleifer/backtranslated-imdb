It seems that if you're going to publish here it's going to be a 10-star rating, nobody seems to dislike you, well, I'm honest, some do not like that, but here we go, the Rachel Ray show is just horrible. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the cute SNL character whatever it was if she had a cooking -any show.i must say that I liked Rachel in the food network for $ 35- $ 40 per day, but I'm sorry that you do not have enough life experience to make it interesting every day, give me ham on the street, anthony bourdain, interesting people, but above all I find it annoying, actually told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" "Yeah in a teasing way, but shut up, you're quiet, and who cares about your pet stories, I'm sorry, Rachel, they canceled you!
