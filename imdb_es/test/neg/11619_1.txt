I can not believe that this terrible movie was made by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Look at that and skip this. The plot is confused and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect that the editor went on vacation in the middle of the movie because fast and choppy cuts begin to appear that only confuse things instead of elucidating them. The end does not make sense either. <br /> <br /> This is predominantly a propaganda film made for the Serbs to feel sorry for themselves and to vilify the United States for the NATO bombing in 1999. They do so by perpetuating the lies about our Serbs allies during the Second World War, claiming that the whole world is unfairly against them, and completely ignore everything said and done by Slobodan Milosevic, as waging war in three neighboring countries. They seem determined to make a political movie, but they only show a few seconds of Milosevic on a television screen without sound. A nationalist agenda obviously exceeded any consideration of art that was not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Regrettably, I recommended this film to a teacher when it was presented last week at the Seattle International Film Festival. He also quoted the bad editing and the confusing plot, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You have been warned
