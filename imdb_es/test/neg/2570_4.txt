Apart from some rather impressive landscapes, this Steven Seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend some time looking at it. For a Seagal movie he has very little (almost no) action, but he puts some reasonable actions (for him) that act in artificial character development scenes. Not recommended. To anybody.
