It has been a tradition since my first VHS recorder that I compiled several of the incarnations of Charles Dickens' old chestnut, and I recorded this and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Fortunately, when it ran on the Hallmark Channel at the non-Divine time of 3 am, I was spared having to edit commercials of it. This was, however, it is only salvation. <br /> <br /> The writing was unbearably boring, with almost no clever scene to keep it from being more than a drunkard like Beverly Hills 90210. In this, a good man who was left out by his celebrity seems the only one logical explanation for her transformation into a presenter of Scrooge-type talk shows. Wasted Dinah Manoff, who only plays the goddess whore with the other goddess Tori Spelling (who, by the way, had more layers of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this Sad adaptation <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are wasted like ghost tickets. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly fun at the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey did not have one, evidently. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling can be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin, and that makes for a bad show all by itself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script does not really give him anything to do, except roll his eyes and let loose a really boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> And what is most irritating was that the transformation of Scroogedom to Tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now, if someone wants to write the latest Scrooge story of George Bush and Karl Rove, we could have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a fan of Mrs. Spelling and / or 90210, this could be your Christmas joy cup. I'd prefer a drink of whiskey and a cold beer to wash myself. It is possible that he will disappear before he is here with me for a long time. <br /> <br /> God save us all!
