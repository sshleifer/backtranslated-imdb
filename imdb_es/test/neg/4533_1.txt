"Film" cuts poorly directed (appears in high definition or betacam). Scream the film / video student all the way. The premise has a limited scope and the short actually feels much longer than it runs. Some interesting moments of performance and a decent production value, but not enough to lift this film from the "hole" in which it has fallen.
