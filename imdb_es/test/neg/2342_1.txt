For me, this movie is just a party movie for very bored teenagers with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotypes (nerds, jocks, popular girls, Sleezy boys, etc.) but with an underlying theme against drugs and drinking. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate opportunity to see this movie, pay attention to all references to responsibility and keep it real (I do not know how to put it another way). I guess it's the only thing that makes this movie great, it would be if the TV were burning it. That, or the DVD on which it exploded ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10000: instead, see Animal House.
