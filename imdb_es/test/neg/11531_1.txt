I had a great time the first 45 min. more or less, but suddenly everything went downhill. The suspense began to thin out a bit and the jokes are a bit similar. What kept him going were the good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it's trying to be cleverly fun, like Tarantino and God is that outdated thing. Tarantino, sometimes a little overrated, this movie comes ten years too late. In the best case it is for teenagers, and I am sure that many of them find the character of Johann fun, which is during the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with this is that the story fades more and more towards the end, you tried to find a point of recovery. Maybe he did not recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. Also, as in many movies, good actors who can afford it do not seem to demand a better dialogue, or simply reject the script.
