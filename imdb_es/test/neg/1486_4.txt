There was a good accumulation of suspense at all times. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering that minimum budget. We are witnesses of occasional episodes of good performance, however, this is quickly deflated by some rather cheesy lines. Understandably, there would not be much intellectual conversation, sitting in the trees while a crocodile is stalking you. The silence would have been gold here. There could have been a bigger game of suspense to say weakly, "I sat in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me there is a slight difference in your brother beating him up instead of being eaten by A powerful 15-foot crocodile. It's up to you. Throughout the film, it seems that I can not find a connection or, for that matter, sympathy with the characters, maybe because they do not develop one throughout the film, it's the character. Occasionally, some are frightened when the crocodile sneaks into the characters, again eclipsed by some questionable scenes. In one case, we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water, but then we sit next to a decapitated corpse with no limbs and only worry about a broken finger. A definite rollercoaster of a movie when it comes to logic.
