Strange with unnecessary chants and backdrops. At random, much of the action will occur on the stage giving the impression of an opera. None of that explains why this is such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It is the impression that there was not enough rehearsal or that no experienced choreographer was available. The performance is flat. Even the brilliant Ziyi Zhang seems to be waiting for his next move or line. You may notice the triviality on this site that indicates that she spent half a month in Japan learning to sign and dance. Read that again like 2 weeks and things start to make sense. Worse still are the little children who seem to be looking at their parents in the back of the studio instead of the camera. <br /> <br /> The cheap and cheerful sfx is simply cheap and cheap. The issue is staccato chops sprinkled with slices of nothing added to anything, except annoyance. Imagine all the dance scenes from the recent Zatoichi, in particular the closing routine, performed by your local high school theater club with a famous actress who speaks in another language (but enrolls her simply because she is very good usually despite of being inadequate), recorded in a cheap camera and then edited in three times its length without any ingenious order.
