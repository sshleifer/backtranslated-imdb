What a terrible movie. The effects were poor, especially by today's standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible repetition of every flood / dam disaster movie ever made on this piece of trash. The performance was horrible and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was very funny. They see the water coming and running for their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very old fat dog to not make Ms. Green look unfit). They manage to overcome the water for a while before taking refuge. How fast! Later, a moving car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. God, she and that dog ran fast! If you want to see a good movie about the breaking of a dam, it's not like that. Porchlight Entertainment produced some good family movies, but this time they simply missed the mark.
