I just had to see this dog, so I would say "Never again!" It is so deeply unmemorable that I had to read other people's reactions before I could remember something beyond (1) it was horrible, (2) Connery should have resigned while he was ahead, and (3) the movie included a gross total A bit, which involves simulating a scan of the retina through the most frightening (not to mention horribly inefficient) means possible. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never understood why someone would even prefer the best of the Connery Bond films, even the worst Outings of Moore or Dalton. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for that matter. Personally, I consider that Octopussy and Moonraker, among other Bond "canonical" films, are much more entertaining than this, and probably for the same reasons that others disapprove of Moore Bond movies, that is, their ironic humor and disposition. to surrender to the absurdity of all Bond's basic medium.
