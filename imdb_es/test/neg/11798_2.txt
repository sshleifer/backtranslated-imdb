Imagine if you wish: four teenage students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to verify the existence of the paranormal. If you see this in the dark and late at night; It is possible for the hair on the back of your neck to rise a couple of times. Otherwise, this mock documentary is a lazy theft of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What it is to be dialogue is very scarce and the actors are nice enough, but they seem to lack a genuine personality. It seems to take an eternity before something really creepy even happens. This film is excellent for "sleeping too much", when both eyes are barely open and everyone is yakin 'and snack.
