I watched this movie a while ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and they voted me down. I tried my best to get the story, because a moviemag had said that this would be a film that would be for Rob Lowe, that Pulp Fiction had been for John Travolta ... Well ... we can all see that not only failed, but that fell all the way down. This is actually the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen a lot of bad films ... it's just not worth watching for free on TV.
