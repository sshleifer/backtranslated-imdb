I must have lost a part of this movie ... I found myself wondering who is this? And when did that happen? It seemed to jump, but I kept looking for fear that I would miss something and they would explain everything to me. I loved Lonesome Dove but this movie did not make any sense to me at all. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? He made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part ... As for the landscape, I thought it was fine ... It made me feel like I was flipping through a book and leaving pages out. The ending also confused me a bit, although I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was destined to leave you wondering if his father would finally return home with his son and would be a father since his mother had already left. the movie ... I do not expect this to win any prize.
