Why is not this movie in the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my fifteen years of life. I had never witnessed such a catastrophic disaster before. Absolutely everything about this is uncomfortable and cheap. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast gives a decent performance. The dialogue is completely incoherent and the humor is not humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole affair. I can not help but cringe when I remember some of his lines, like "In or out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your friend is not a very good poker player, she just revealed her hand." <br /> <br /> The kidnappers are a joke. Even I could make dinosaur effects more realistic than these filmmakers have done without shame. It's an insult to the real velociraptors, or any dinosaur, for that matter. Not only that, but the killing scenes are too frightening even for me. I do not seriously believe that these animals tear their victim to pieces and throw pieces all over the floor just to make everything look fatter. Also, blood and guts are useless when you can see the deaths that come from miles and miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Jurassic Park movies and the dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers did not anticipate anyone with a dash of intelligence or sense to ignore the bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on HBO late at night, like I did. If I could say one thing to anyone involved in this film, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Try to show some respect."
