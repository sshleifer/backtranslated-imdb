A film by Almodovar- gives me a chill down my back every time. The uppercase impression that opens the last characteristic of the Spanish author instantly induces memories of seductive nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, crazy transsexuals and I have not even gotten that far to the critical work of the infant infant. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera walking through a cemetery swept by the wind animated by a horde of widows who feverishly rubbed the tombstones, I thought Pedro had me under his evil spell again. <br /> <br /> However, once, my nostalgia had diminished, there was very little to fill your place. For a director who delights in bringing humanity to murderers and rapists, he does a very poor job of finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, an obstinate housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental murder of her daughter by her abusive husband. Fortunately she lives in the Spain of Almod√≥var, where your friends will gladly help you get rid of a corpse by offering a round of cocktails. Add to the crucible the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentrically warm matriarchs. "Back" literally means returning, and Pedro seems to be recycling old material. The secondary plot of incest feels as if it has been added as the obligatory "taboo". Instead of commenting or subverting the issue, as in the treatment of pedophilia in bad manners, he feels forced and unconvincing amidst the sentimentality of the film. I suggest that Almodovar call his next film Exit (to move on).
