Well, I had the opportunity to see this movie the other day. I did not know what to expect since I never saw the trailer and that ... but what I discovered just by watching the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've had the misfortune to watch. <Br /> <br /> I wish I could give this film a grade of 0. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as it got to the party scene, I just wanted to go into a coma, it was very badly done. The actors had no direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that say it's good if you have a small child to entertain for 90 minutes, etc. But in reality, why should we expose children to this kind of film? He has a bad mood, rude and rude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of his time. I'm sure some people in Hollywood will take to the streets after this movie. <br /> <br /> Also How can 39 people give this movie a 10. I mean anyone who gives a 10 to this movie? He has some mental problem and works for the film company. This movie should have an average of 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 due to the people who rated it as 10. Very sad.
