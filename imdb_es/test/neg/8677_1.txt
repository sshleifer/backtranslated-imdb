I doubt that whoever wrote this script read Mansfield Park ... or if they did, it was not very good. None of the characters is what they should be: Fanny is cheerful and aware of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris's personality. In addition, a first-person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate for both her story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would say she is not meant to be. In addition, in the movie version, Fanny flirts shamelessly with Edmund from the beginning, when they were raised as brothers! Fanny, from Austen, would have shrunk from any kind of flirting, and the novel describes the Fanny / Edmund couple as something very uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park is not based on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a novel very different from the others; It does not pretend to be a love story I watched this movie because I just finished reading Mansfield Park, and I am absolutely horrified by what I see; Miss Austen is rolling in her grave.
