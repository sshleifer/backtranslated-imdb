If you pack all the clichés about firefighters in the city in 105 minutes; You have Ladder 49. <br /> <br /> It has a story but it is very cloudy by all the clichés. It makes it into a movie that with every event; It becomes so predictable that it's not worth seeing. There is no depth in the story and even the acting seems superficial. <br /> <br /> It seemed like I wanted to be a tribute to the firemen, but it ended up being boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison being fatally trapped under an inaccessible part of a building and the firefighters trapped under the rubble of the Twin Towers was too obvious. It does not set an example for future films about firefighters.
