It's a bit disconcerting when a studio refuses to screen a movie for the press before it hits the market. That so many films are not a surprise, but when a studio admits it in advance, the process of going to the movies becomes a kind of passion. Consider an anticipated Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that "Aeon Flux" is not nearly the affront to the taste and decency that one might expect, given the above. Although he is ultimately overwhelmed by his shortcomings, at least he has (more or less) an idea to play with. Pity that the director Karyn Kusama seems to have little idea of ​​how to execute everything. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There has been a plague. There is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. The latter are known as the Monicans, and far from being a cult to those who love the beret or the tennis racket, are in attempts to overthrow the first, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is occasionally bad for the citizenry, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and his friends can resist. Through some type of virtual reality biochemical technology, monicans receive orders from their beloved leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess who seems to have been crossed with a carrot. It is up to Aeon to circumvent some futuristic spandex complements that conform to the way to carry out the orders of the High Carrot, which of course are a version of "destroy the regime". Having seen years before her sister was liquidated by the Goodchilds, she does not need to be very convincing. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that things get complicated. The Goodchilds may not be exactly what they seem, and Aeon herself could have an unexpected story with them. Although occasionally confusing, the central concept of the film (of which I will not reveal further) contains some clear ideas about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for a much larger examination of what the film does not take advantage of, but the ideas are there, at least. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has taken the baffling decision to film almost all the action so close that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is edited in a series of jump cuts that leave us completely lost. The result is a serious spatial disorientation that takes over the film. The aesthetic of "Aeon Flux" is an elegant dress, architecture of strange angles and agile characters. Much of the action occurs in minimalist and open spaces that ask for some long and uninterrupted shots that can convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above. Instead, we have seconds of limb flight, broken glass and sound effects that accompany it. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good movie that tries to get out of the "Aeon Flux" tide. Put this in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, for example, and the results could be quite different. However, as it is, I felt that "Aeon Flux" was voluntarily distancing me from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This movie is not tied to its own strengths. Like a novice poker player who receives a real straight, he somehow finds a way to lose despite his potential.
