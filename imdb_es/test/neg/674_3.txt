Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter do not mind seeing all the ridiculous models to sell something. Strange places, too much makeup and too much skin is not necessary. Sex is not always sold when it is being sold to women. The same goes for the path of the horse tread that seems unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and need to have that in the show. My daughter has an interior seam of 36 ", she is tall and slender and a size 5, I am more average than a size 12. We would like to see both, I can not imagine what it would look like when a size 2 wears it, it will not fit I do not buy magazines because they are unilateral in this matter, we would love for the series to consider women of all sizes.
