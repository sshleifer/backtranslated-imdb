This movie is terrible, honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me tremble, the effects are completely lousy (which I do not normally care about for the older films, but this was done only two years ago), and all that bothers me. Some friends leave Halloween in the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that has the cliche "Do you really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story", the routine went on for a while. The witch's cannibal son became a retard (I do not know if it was because of comedy or to make it scary, but this movie failed in both). It has a minimum of bleeding and not nudity, which worsened a bad movie even more. Hell, the only good thing about this movie is the scene of eating legs, and even that could have been better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do not even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly not. consider buying or renting this; otherwise, you will kick yourself for wasting time that could have been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.
