I captured this at IFC last week and thought it was typical of the independent short film: loaded with style, little content and originality. Is it a surprise that a movie that comes out is starring an unusually attractive guy (and blonde to boot) with 70-year-old hair and too cool clothes for school? In addition, this film wallows at the end of the 1970s, which works for some ("The Virgin Suicides" by Sofia Coppola comes to mind) but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another critic compared this with the work of Harmony Korine and I agree. However, I do not see this as something positive (what has EL done lately, anyway?). "Bobbycrush" is really a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you see it at night on the cable, turn the channel and look something else.
