The exceptionally dumb activist with Braindead leaders in a story that would have been suitable for a Spiderman filler problem. The action sequences never really flow as they should, leaving some fresh fragments orphaned in a sea of ​​sounds and fury, which mean nothing. I really wonder how they will launch this in the West. Sam Lee behaves like a madman, the newcomer Edison Chan does not show any talent as an actor yet. The robot is clumsy and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (although made by sfx-people from the US) are ridiculous and totally destroy any remaining suspension of disbelief. I'm not looking forward to the Gen-Z cops ...
