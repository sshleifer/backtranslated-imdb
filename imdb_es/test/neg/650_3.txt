I really wanted to like this movie, but the pace was too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a good story, but it really was like watching a slug race. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been better served, if there was more action. I do not want to say anything great, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also have been helped by songs that set the tone / mood of the longest periods that were absent from the dialogue. br /> <br /> It's been about 10 years since I've seen it, so I may have to give it another try. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (of every four)
