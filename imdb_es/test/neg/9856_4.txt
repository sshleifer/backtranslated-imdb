This episode sucks. <br /> <br /> In recent years I have seen all the episodes of "Next Generation" and "Voyager" and now I am watching "Enterprise". <br /> <br /> I am completely enjoying this series Until this episode. I looked at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It's more like a slapstick attempt. <br /> <br /> It does not build the characters, but throws them to the ground, and leaves the audience breathless. It does little to build the series. <br /> <br /> Why it was once allowed to go on the air amazes me. Was it the writing? Was it the address? Was it the producer? We will probably never know. <br /> <br /> But a bad apple is not bad, I suppose. I say that with hope it is only one.
