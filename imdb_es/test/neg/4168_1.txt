Interesting concept that simply does not. I watched the whole movie, but I had to read IMDb's comments to find out what Code 46 meant. If / when it was explained in the movie, I must have been in a coma, or possibly brain dead by then. I only saw it by Tim Robbins. The fact that he did not know any of the other actors should have been a warning. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie should not be that. As for the 'virus of empathy virus', Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler, etc.? Also, why are all women so horribly ugly? If I want to see stick figures that are not simple, I will simply walk down the street. The best part of the movie was the car accident. It was totally credible, and not exaggerated like most movies.
