I watched him with great concern and, apparently, my fear was well founded. What was this movie about? Gentleman? The season? Players? What? I was all over the place all the time. I had no tension (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, an excellent actor, appears as sending anger by mail and releasing zero stress. Cheap shooting, like an episode of MacGiver. Contrast this main course of Thanksgiving with the work that HBO did in Don King's movie "Only in the United States" to show how to make sports biopics, warts and all. Do you realize that ESPN promoted it and then never showed it again?
