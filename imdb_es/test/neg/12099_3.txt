The horror genre co-stars of Cheesy 80's, Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash, along with Brenda Bakke, are some of the featured players in this tale about an enchanted health club. The ridiculous dialogue and some unpleasant effects make this film visible. Not bad, but there are no big tremors either. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and acting. Only for fans of movies B. <br /> <br /> B
