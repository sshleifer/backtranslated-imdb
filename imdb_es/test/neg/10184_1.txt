Movies about U.F.O. They are always a good way to kill time, so one rainy Sunday night I went back to this movie, waiting for what you can expect from a U.F.O. Mystery. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! Approximately halfway in the movie, it becomes very evident that the U.F.O. The theme is only a deceptive way of attracting confident viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christian movie of an average Christian. No, this is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist type. The class that is scary. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, the unbelieving leader is tricked by his colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the Rapture has begun (what Christians believe is what happens). at the end of time, when true believers go to heaven and unbelievers stay behind). <br /> <br /> When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer. "Just in case Christians are right." Now that is a more false excuse to become a Christian if questions! <br /> <br /> This film is still trying to convert non-believers through fear tactics: "Believe in God or you will go to hell!" is the message here Simple, but quite offensive, actually. this film is selling itself as something completely different. <br /> <br /> Now suppose that you yourself are a Christian fundamentalist and are not likely to be offended by the themes of this movie, is this a good idea? I'm afraid it's not, no, actually I'm lying: I'm glad it's not! The acting is horrible, the rhythm is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is ridiculously bad. movie, you immediately feel that this is going to be worse than I expected, and you will be right. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, it seems like at least trying to set up a passable Mystery UFO, but suddenly they bring this Count Dracula who looks like himself and starts babbling about the devil. At first you only think that this guy is a crazy maniac, but it turns out that he really represents the real opinions of the creators of this movie. As soon as you begin to realize this, you know how this will end. But in reality it ends worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
