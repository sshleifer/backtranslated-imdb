GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A comedy / western film with Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at the moment, which I have always enjoyed as the "third Stooge") doing its usual routine, and directed by the normally reliable Edward Bernds, who also made some of his funniest classic shorts, so one must ask himself, what went wrong this time? The most likely answer is that what worked quite well as a 15-minute double reeler is too much for a 55-minute movie. Unlike many of its classic short tracks, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth visiting again. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
