How I deserved to see this shit? Infinitely worse. The performance was horrible, when I read that this was a comedy that at least I expected to smile, once or twice, but ... If you're wanting to lose an hour and a half of your lives, this is the right movie. I recommend just looking at a wall or something, anything other than seeing this "movie". I can even watch a documentary (if you're a man) about pregnant women, I guarantee you will be more entertaining. paper. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
