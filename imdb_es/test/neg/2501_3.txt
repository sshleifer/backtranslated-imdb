As a big fan of terror, I realize that certain marketing tactics are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. So I would not call it naïveté since I assumed that this was a mild horror of the theft of the Cannibal / Zombie / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong since this is very hard. I should have realized that when I saw the odd warning "No real or identifiable child was used" it occurred. Do you realize the identifiable part as if it were challenging us to catch it? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikinis, is led by a boat captain with a penchant for fishing on the beach, in search of mutated native villagers. Due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation turned the latter man into a rapist / murderer. <br /> <br /> Writer / actor George Eastman is the only one who is dealing here and manages to keep his clothes on. The sex scenes are hit. Women walk naked, exuding a strange overconfidence, and one of them even asks for a rape when her husband rejects her. Well, two chicks that are slapping each other naturally become a lesbo scene because women are horndogs. I saw the girl throw another chick salad and touch herself. <br /> <br /> If there's something you should know about this movie, it's that. Because the rest of this crazy movie is the same. Oh, who am I cheating? There is much more to tell here. As the white "duchess" who pays 2 black men to be labeled in a room. Or the "duchess" who takes off the top part to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. When he rejects her advances, she begins to cry. So being the good gentleman he is, reluctantly lets him please him in front of the other members of the crew. I was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the "duchess" would ask if there's any other way to pay him. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they go to the island to carry out their research. Wait, I thought this was a zombie movie? But the zombie does not enter until the 73rd minute, but at that moment all the others have been "admitted" in abundance. I found myself moving forward a few scenes or several. This is my first splash porn movie and I do not think I do that subgenre of justice. I guess the woman inside me is talking when I say that I would like more plot and less sweaty, slimy and hairy sex. The funny thing is that this could have worked like a decent horror movie, since the idea of ​​atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family was good. Even the character of Eastman shakes his head and moves away from a couple who copulates. I wonder if it was the character or the writer who got angry. <br /> <br /> I do not feel like entering the sound or the quality of the film because you should have guessed that it was bad. This production was shot backwards with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which presents the majority of the same cast. Eastman has said that this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck. It does not matter, I want to talk about the sound suddenly. The sound was strange during the sex scenes because while the cast speaks Italian, it seems that they recorded voiceovers in English and played it in their dialogues. Then, while 2 people are boned, I can clearly hear someone in the background say, "No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly funny Italian score that could not save this movie. The SFX was minimal in the best of cases and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes. And I would like to point out that there were no violent scenes of rape as the brilliant warning label on the DVD cover said (ahem, another marketing tactic), so there is no fear there. Only fear the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented on a widescreen aspect screen of 1.85: 1. I saw the unrated version of Region 1 that ran at 113 minutes launched in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. Apparently there is a XXX version of Alpha Digital, which is the same execution time, so I doubt that something is different. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or, as I would recommend, do not pay anything and pretend that it does not exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Ship Mate: "Civilians are bad luck, women are bad luck, they are also scientists, they must be monsters." Extras on DVD: Original trailer with shots and unconditional killings to make it look more interesting than it is, Trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle and ENOTLD, and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Lame porn, but even weaker like a horror movie. Either get real porn or watch real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
