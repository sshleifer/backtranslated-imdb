The creature? Yes, and the movie that stars. Hell would seem infinitely more terrifying if the condemned were forced to see this for all eternity. Six university students take refuge in a condemned hospital to save money and end up being victims of an ancient monster that must claim five victims before it returns to the "dark world from which it emerged". In addition to having major problems of logic and coherence (plus the fact that it seems to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and directed, and makeup effects are almost non-existent. It's also significantly shorter than it claims (in just 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. It's the worst movie I've seen of the Full Moon productions of executive producer Charles Band, and that's BAD! <br /> <br /> As a note, I almost do not bother with a review, but this has received inexplicably good reviews. here and I thought that a varied opinion was in order. Proceed with caution!
