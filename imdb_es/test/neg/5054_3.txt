This absurd movie was about a teenager from "Goodie-two-shoe", who really wanted to be Valedictorian but finds her obstacle in the name of a teacher, Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces the "biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate comes with the sample of final exams that should help them pass the exam of Mrs. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle appears, catches Holmes, the classmate and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. Convinced that the three planned to cheat on the exam here, Ms. Tingle is excited about her chance to ruin Holmes once and for all with accusations that can eliminate any chance of Holmes moving into his class. And the classmate, who apparently has his eyes on Holmes, always wonders why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot). Feeling desperate, Holmes and his friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her from believing that Holmes planned to cheat. Everything goes off again when the classmate points a bow and arrow at Mrs. Tingle, threatening to do things right for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle defends herself, but eventually ends up being Holmes and the captive of her friend. <br /> <br /> During the imprisonment of Mrs. Tingle under Holmes, they do everything possible to tie her up and gag her in her own bed to blackmail her. False photos they took of the unconscious coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself cringing when the children were settling into Mrs. Tingle's house, eating their food and doing their private work. At one point, Holmes found Ms. Tingle's grade book and deliberately changed the note to her favor, lowering her challenge rating for the valedictorian. The ending was developed as a childish attempt to recover the comedy that was moderate at the beginning of the film, and was resolved with pure irony, slap and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This has to be the most unpleasant and perverse. The character that Holmes would interpret in all his life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle free herself to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and deceitful. He even slept with the classmate despite the great interest of his best friend in him ... and he did not like it. In trying to ruin the qualifications of his rivals by taking Mrs. Tingle's grade book and his best friend's man, one would think that Holmes would get what he deserves in the end, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires, proving that being mean, manipulative, selfish and whining can get you what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was supposed to be the character you did not like. They did not take me to that point once to believe that she was the woman who needed to be "taught this lesson." She was like any other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment for the next generation. Personally, I felt that her opinions about the young people were validated by the actions of Holmes and her friend at all times. He hoped she could free herself to call the police and locate Holmes. They kept her tied up in bed, they ate their food like a handful of pigs, they drank the woman's wine, they fouled their personal belongings and we're supposed to believe that she did not deserve to bring a bat to each of her companions. heads And the classmate has to be one of the most disgusted characters in the history of cinema. Forget about an idiot, we need a new word for him that is not in Webster's dictionary. He brought the biggest problem to Holme's life and then made things worse when he entered Mrs. Tingle's house, uninvited behind Holmes, and cornered Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow. I got emotional every time Mrs. Tingle had the opportunity to shoot her, or to strangle the aspiring best friend of the actress. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and want to see when the manipulation of a teenager and bad actions can make him or her move away from the world, watch this unintentional movie, full of cartoons and not intentional.
