This fantasy was absolute trash. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market in ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was much worse than what he ever did. It is not surprising that critics of the British media complain that it is driven by sensationalist journalism. This movie is the biggest fantasy of a crazy leftist that comes to life on the big screen. Anyone who is slightly to the right of such rabid Bush fanatics should be dismayed, as funding was once possible. However, I am sure it will work well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that in these days of crazy Muslims who exploit innocent travelers, there is someone in the UK who thinks that Britain should surrender in the war against terrorism. I guess it's not the country I admired for being alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. Greet Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!
