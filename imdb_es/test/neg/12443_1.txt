My mom brought this movie to me on a DVD. A guy in a rental recommended it. But, in fact, this could be the worst movie I've seen. You know, I did not expect much from this movie, but I did not have a good story, it was not even fun and it did not make sense. I really wanted to see Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved Step by step. Even she was a big disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the boys at the party is dead (in fact, he was not dead, he woke up later), it seems that the house exploded a bomb and that there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. But then comes a homosexual, a policeman ... There is a total disaster until the end and the boys managed to recover and everything in about 15 minutes. Come on, just be realistic at least. Lost of money Really...
