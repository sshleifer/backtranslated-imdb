1 Â° seen 1/1/2003 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): Sober drama about a wealthy doctor who gets into trouble to maintain a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings to live. them, as well as marry another in the same house. His search for happiness is not clear, but they do explain the reason for his unhappiness by showing the dominant trait of the females in his wife's line. Well played, but predictable drama.
