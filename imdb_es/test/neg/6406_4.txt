There was a time when Joel Schumacher was quite high on my list of favorite directors. In the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was associated with several great movies like "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down", he was one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. Then came the stupid sequels of "Batman", unfortunately, and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime script became a huge mess in the hands of Schumacher. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better movies and even the incredibly imbecile concept of "The Number 23" should have been transformed into a more convincing and entertaining film. Literally, from beginning to end, "The Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and strange thriller and, therefore, uses all the terrible clich√©s of the great book of film history, including high-voice narration, flashbacks, structures disordered, characters with multiple personalities. , numerous twists in the plot that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum environments. However, nothing helps simply because of the simplicity of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired commitment of the cast and crew. As much as you try to associate with the main character and have an open mind about the crazy theories, this is still a movie about a two-digit number and the two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non comic role) is a boring animal hunter whose wife Agatha gives him a strange book on his birthday. The book talks about all kinds of diabolical theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23. Walter almost quickly identifies with the protagonist of the book (a poor quality detective who investigates a bleak case of suicide) and begins to detect abundant examples of the 23 enigmas. in his own private life. I did a research on Google and Wikipedia and, apparently, this nonsense of total numerology 23 really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly related to this evil number. Well, that's just ?? crazy! But well, I'm not here to judge the beliefs and fears of people, no matter how insane they are, and I can only share my humble opinion about a movie that is based on an unbridled mad conundrum. "Number 23" has no suspense, despite several dark and unpleasant makeup effects, and never in a moment manages to make you reflect on the role of numbers in your own life. All the cast members perform below their normal abilities, but it was still a joy to see the lovely Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively large production again. Definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a night of suspense, solid and creepy, but durable and not entirely without merit.
