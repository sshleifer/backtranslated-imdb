I just finished watching an episode (S1- # 5 A boy in a bush), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on that episode, this is a very poor version of CSI. The acting is shit. The main character, Dr, whatever his name is, is so false that it really hurts. I would not throw her out to make a dog food supplement! <br /> <br /> The other hurtful thing is David Boreanaz of the fame of the "Angel", a good actor, he does a great job, but it's wasted because it's not like that. The idiotic performance of that woman. <br /> <br /> The cast is fine, but everything is ruined due to this stupid performance by Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing version of CSI, I'm really sorry to see it. It appears in the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it. <br /> <br /> That woman is really bad, at least in that episode. But based on this view, I will not even invest in looking at it even if it shows on the screen of an elevator.
