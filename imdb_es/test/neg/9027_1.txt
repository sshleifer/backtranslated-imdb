Vicente Aranda has made a terrible historical film. It shows the scarce resources of Spanish cinema. In the film, an unreal script shows Juana as a nympho, facing Felipe, worried only about sex ... but sex with others not with her. The technical errors begin with the wedding ring that shows Isabel de Castilla. Nobody noticed that? Then, the voiceover seems like a documentary, the actors and actress of the film sometimes laugh (check out the sequence when Juana comes to the council that wants to keep her isolated); the castles are almost broken when at the time of the film they were recently built, the crowds are only "four" people, the lights are badly placed ... Compared with Amelie Poulain, the French movie for the oscars ... has no sense to talk about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
