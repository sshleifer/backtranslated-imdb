Although I do not recommend this movie, I do not recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Although I have not delivered the ending, or most of the twists of the plot, this movie would look better without prior information. It is difficult to identify the main problem with the movie Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have compiled enough teen anger scenes, nighttime stoner tirades, justifications and a harmless and banal philosophy to inspire twenty dramas of adolescent anguish; then he combined them into a single two-hour package with a touch of science fiction. The result is deeply distressing, for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to guide the audience through complicated paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with the one-dimensional characters and, above all, expects them to ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unrecognized loose ends, hiding it below. A CGI and neo-surrealism effects page. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and hostile and disaffected by his suburban life. We are destined to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes it is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie responds with a theory of his own, his friend complains that Donnie acts "all smart." Donnie's speech, however, is not smarter than his friend's, only more angry. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his director's description of his standardized test scores as "intimidating"; but given the inclination of the director against the simple categorization of the human elements (as shown in the sequence FEAR-LOVE), this is a poor substitute for the development of the character. Donnie takes prescription drugs to combat mental problems, which are not directly addressed in this film. In fact, the whole drug issue is underestimated, and one of the first opportunities the director has to redeem the movie is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all this may be a product of his imagination, takes a back seat, which makes the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very unstable. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best they sound like uninformed and detached ramblings. We have the idea that the writer of the film once read a book about time travel or some chapters, and we can not remember how it worked, but I was sure it was really interesting and I wanted to include it in the film. The scientific part, as a result, depends to a large extent on the expensive computer animations that the real development of the theories involved (at a given moment, a professor who discusses the journey in time says that if he continues talking about the subject, it will be fired). no more explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit various vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a delicate matter. It hurts your school, but it's okay, because your school does not treat you like a person. His punishment of a spooky defender of self-esteem (similar to the character of Tom Cruise in Magnolia) results in the public humiliation of man. But should the audience believe that Donnie is a kind of avenging angel, attacking ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems to ignore the effects of these actions until after the fact. Apart from these faults, the film is riddled with flat and uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story takes place in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director touches this point during the film. However, the focus extends exactly here: Donnie's gruff, blue-necked father is voting for Bush, while his rebellious, free-spirited daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing remotely like a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter must be left out. In the same way, Donnie's sincere speech about not being able to group all human emotions into the vapid categories of "fear and" love; "This does not ask the audience to make big leaps of understanding, everyone knows that there are more than two emotions, and the particular emphasis on this fact has no value." Mr. Kelly pays tribute to various symbols of pop culture in The 80s in his film: ET, Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future In his heart, this film feels like the director's, Homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disappointments, sewn approximately by untrained hands, complete songs are reproduced in a music video format to the actions of the characters, apparently because the director likes the songs, the characters that have little or nothing to do with the plot ( including the archetypal bully, the fat one and the right idiot teacher) are given an unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in. Somehow, the uncomfortable mess that is Donnie D arko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in a meaningless, messy and sinuous effort. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10.
