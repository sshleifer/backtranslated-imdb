How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of those who wear lenses with thick black frames and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, I just do not see how he is still paying this guy for making such a gut. How can Lynch, in a careless way, make the images of a failed TV pilot and turn it into a disaster with no sense and bad performance, and make the critics comment it and really include it in the best lists of the year? <br /> <br /> I'm confused. If you are looking for a good black cinema, rent "Bound". If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie try with "Memento". But beware of this stinky exaggerated unless your idea of ​​a fun night is to discard 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard earned money.
