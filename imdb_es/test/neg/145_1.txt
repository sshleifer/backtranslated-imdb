This movie is really a big piece of trash that tries to look like a Hollywood production. Sketch of a poor story (stupid story of a robot) ... a very bad performance of the idols of pop without talent ... and they are trying to "FIGHT"! My God ... those miserable actors use wires to make them look like they are "good fighters" ... :( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen! I will play his movies again ... ¡¡¡¡Válido a todos costa !! I wanted to give it a negative value of ten ... it's not even worth 0/10.
