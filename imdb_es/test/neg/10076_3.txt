To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our mistakes, inconsistent plots, untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this film. The story seemed trivial to the point of inconsequential and the lines of the plot as undeveloped as the embryos of dinosaurs still encased in the jar of shaving cream from Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the characters generated any kind of sympathy or feeling In short, this film lacked the suspense and emotion that the first film offered from the point of view of a story. <br /> <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyls). Brief shots of the new species and only 2 really participated in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and paleontologist from earlier childhood, the lack of real scientific content (not that it was realistic, but logical). The way they built the dinos in number 1 and the ramblings of the malcom chaos was also disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie seemed to be no more than an excuse to return to the dinosaur scene to make some money. I hope the filmgoers do not fall into this trap again (although apparently I did)
