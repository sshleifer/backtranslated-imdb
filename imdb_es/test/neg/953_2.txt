As an iconic show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the biggest fall of G4 TV; it is a spectacle (and a station) that has fallen to the point that the sex parades to try to cover its obvious faults. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place to solve technology problems and explore the latest and the best in technology. It was a good show with a nice staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments that the team could organize. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 annoyed some fans of the station for a long time. , but the first performances were really promising. The emphasis on games was a good addition and I really enjoyed the coverage of E3 and other great entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS is now just a shell of its own self. Those who oversee the channel have changed the focus of the technology and gaming channel and are heading towards anything that can cause the drooling of young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends so much time marching with Olivia Munn or promoting the adult film industry as it does with games. It's so bad that you can hardly see it. <br /> <br /> While some may get a childish joy with this kind of thing, those who really enjoy the games may wonder where the good coverage was. Equally worrying, the young players who could be tuned into G4 thinking they are getting games, that group of active games between 10 and 15, instead, receive food aimed at a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. In G4, it is tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another channel aimed at men, has good programming as CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little to offer. <br /> <br /> Very bad, really.
