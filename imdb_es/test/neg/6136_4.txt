Jumping Butterballs, this movie stinks! It is a boring and apathetic drag that never ceases. It is a wonder that someone has bothered to make up Groucho with his strange eyebrows and mustaches, since there is nothing ingenious or scandalous to do or say throughout this boredom. Chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo offers a smile or two, and there is very little of that for everyone. He figures in a noisy hotel manager and another odious comedic comedian in Frank Albertson, and the road becomes even more rugged. <br /> <br /> A true misfire.
