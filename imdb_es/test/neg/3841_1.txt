I would like to start by saying that I would not see this movie again if they were handing out solid gold popcorn and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can not give this a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars. The acting is absolutely terrible. This movie is a farce based on the classic "The most dangerous game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo provides a better scenario, Ben should reassure the ladies who see him. I'm not upset about the $ 7 I paid to see the move, I'd just like to have the 90 minutes of my life returned. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me back my time?" Samuel L. Jackson, Changing Lanes
