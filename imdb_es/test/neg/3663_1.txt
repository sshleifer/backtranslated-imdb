Is not it the best movie in the world? That was an understatement. Personally I did not like this movie at all. Not by the line of history, not by graphic violence and nudity. Nudity did not really need to be in it, it did not do anything for the story, except that maybe the girls were going through a difficult time, and being naked probably had annoyed them even more. But one of the things in the movie that I hated ... was that it was very dark. You really could not tell what was happening. I think if it was not so dark, and you could see where they were, then it might not have been that bad. All you know is that it's a basement somewhere. You do not see any house, no road, the killer in it, all you could see was half of his face for about 5 seconds. I want to see some things in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of quite dark and everything you see from time to time is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that really stood out to me that was good with the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the suspense of how the film will end, but the suspense of ... I can see anything in this movie, except some naked bodies and several blinking lights. But, honestly, people, this was an aspiring Saw with Blair Witch Project. Both first level films and both with the correct lighting to discover what was happening. Forget about this movie if you can see ... if you're a blind person ... maybe you want to rent it to hear the screams if you like that kind of thing. But, again, if you're blind, you're probably not reading this either ... so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
