Being too young to have experienced Hammer's films when they were new and fresh, I am discovering their sacred horror films when I found them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry of the Christopher Lee series. The original vampire story Hammer had a great atmosphere and a fantastic story to get involved. Lee was a great Dracula, a vibrant vampire, if possible, at the early exit, but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that is almost always around and looks threatening. Fashionable young people talk like cartoon characters (a Although my aunt lived in England during the 1970s and says that people really spoke with those horrible clich√©s). I had no interest in who lived or died among the younger people. They were all pretty terrible characters anyway. I enjoyed watching a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; But she leaves the story too soon. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing add an air of authenticity to the film, but they can not draw blood from this empty film. It is D.O.A.
