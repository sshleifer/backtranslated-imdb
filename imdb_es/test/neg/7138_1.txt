What a horrible movie. This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and it was just confusing. All the time I was watching it, I was looking forward to it! I felt that I lost 2 hours of my life and that I will never return. Save your money and do not rent this movie. Now I see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was hardly in the movie. The first movie was great, but this was just bullshit. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save money and watch the trailer because it is the only thing worth seeing with this movie. This movie also did not have a real story. I'm still wondering what I saw.
