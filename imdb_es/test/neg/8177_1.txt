I do not mind a bit of adult humor, but this feature was completely dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor swore to a guy who took pictures and followed my profanities. I do not know what happened between that moment the last 5 minutes because I left. After seeing this, I never looked at Richard Pryor in the same way again. And to think that he was actually the host of a children's show. <br /> <br /> If the profanity and the bad taste, the dirty jokes and without grace make you laugh, then probably you will enjoy this. But if you're an "old-fashioned" type, then do not bother.
