I really wanted to see this movie, I thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. A policeman (Andy Garcia) has a son who is dying and needs a bone marrow replacement to live. The only coincidence is a convicted serial killer who escapes from jail. To save your child, you have to locate the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the convict in one of the many disappointing aspects of the film. Keaton is a great actor sometimes, but here it is quite boring. It is exaggerated to the point where you simply stop worrying. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better, but he tries too hard for a movie that does not measure up. Barbet Schroeder (once such a promising director with films like "Barfly" who almost did not represent anything in the US market) heads well enough: I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big mess. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director, all due to a faulty script. What should have been a tense and stimulating movie is just an act of Hollywood action.
