Seriously, I thought it was a parody when I saw it in the rental store, but I realized it was crap, I can not even believe I did not turn it off, as we all know those snakes were not rattles, they were pythons and Gardner's, the performance was lame and I still can not believe the end. If you're going to see it, just look at it for the end. It was much more valuable than the sixth sense. I do not even know if the creators of the movie actually. I thought that this title would fly, the only time it will really fly is when I throw it away ... I only see it to laugh, it was very funny in the most stupid way. NO SHOPPING ONLY RENT.
