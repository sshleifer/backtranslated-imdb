While watching "End of days," I had the feeling that the filmmakers were perhaps trying to make this unique for the Hollywood average action movie. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams really tried to direct this time, instead of just producing another flat action movie. He tried to inject atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en") but here seems like a cheap trick to try to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shots and fight scenes, except for the mediocre, sub-par / f final "battle". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates his real capacity, showing good work and movement of pictures, but it is nothing more than solid work. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the movie's biggest enemy. In some parts, the script actually shows the characteristics of a good religious thriller, and sometimes even shows some almost intellectual thinking (the scene of the temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small advantages are stifled by a river of negatives . Generic dialogs / characters, protruding plot hollows and convenient plot points that simply point all characters in the right direction are just some of the standard Hollywood black holes Marlowe frames. The shadow of the good movie may have vanished very quickly. <br /> <br /> The movie, surprisingly, has a good cast. Arnold, who still has that attitude bigger than life, tries to play a depressed policeman, to the limit, with results nothing more than average. Stick to being the invincible hero Arnie, that's what you're good at. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the whole, bringing a pleasant air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In a role of mature villain to exaggerate, Byrne refrains and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, can bring at least some laughs to the movie, but he has done better. Also look for a small stellar role by Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams looked like he was trying to separate him from the faceless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was heading in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to take him there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
