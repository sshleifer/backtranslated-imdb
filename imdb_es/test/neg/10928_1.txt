It seems that the people involved in this movie are filling the urn to increase their ratings. The good news is that apparently only 18 people have seen it. I guess that makes me the 19. I'm not involved with the film and I do not know anyone who has done it and I'm an IMDb user for a long time (check my vote and comment history in the last seven years), what I promise I am giving an honest and impartial response. opinion. You get a 30 year old terror fan who also appeared in a couple of low budget movies. <br /> <br /> Aside from a couple of interesting video effects, "Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent, Bored, and technically flawed beyond reason. Apparently, it was recorded on a silent paper and the audio was copied; Most of this seems like it was recorded with a can and a piece of string, anyway. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I watched it from start to finish and I have no idea what the story was, even if there was one. It seems that the director is being impressed mainly with long and panoramic shots of the corners of the table and dead black spaces that do nothing but eliminate the film. That would be a problem if we were actually developing a plot and making a movie that had a certain sense of rhythm. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It does not matter how the scenes are recorded because they do not add to a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is an exercise in futility at all levels. Anyone who has worked on that is writing and yet they are trying to influence the rankings here in IMDb, this is a bad and tedious thing. <br /> <br /> That's the honest truth. If you are thinking about spending your money or time on this, think again. It is easy to find something better because you will not find it much worse. <br /> <br /> And that is the truth impartial and unadorned.
