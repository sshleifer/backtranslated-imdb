Film based on the best-selling novel by Jacqueline Susann. This is Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless television presenter who makes his way to the top. He details his love life by focusing on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and instead lie down with any woman he can get. <br /> <br /> The novel is not a work of art (it is not even good literature) but it is a fast, silly and poor quality technique. read. But this movie makes it look like "Gone with the Wind"! This is a textbook example of how NOT to make a film adaptation. First they condense the novel terribly. The book deals with Stone's inability to commit and reveals why. Here he has been raised ... and ignored. There is also a truly disgusting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It is in the book, but there is a reason totally excluded from the film. And the book was about three women, not two. I do not even mean homophobia. <br /> <br /> Apart from the adaptation, the acting is quite terrible. The law is just as horrendous as Stone, VERY wooden and boring, you seriously wonder why all these women are after him. To be fair to the law, another actor was chosen but had a very serious accident before filming began and Law intervened at the last minute. Wexler is terrible like Amanda; Maureen Arthur is incredibly bad like Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (having a GREAT time) camps him as a gay photographer; Cannon is really very good and Robert Ryan is just great. Also Dionne Warwick sings the catchy opening song ("He Moving On"). <br /> <br /> IT'S BAD, but I saw it all and it's (in a way, really fun) a lot of fun. I give her a 3. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann also has a cameo as a news anchor.
