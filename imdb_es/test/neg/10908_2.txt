Another novelty: this French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. I may hurry a bit when I say that this is probably my last Rohmer movie, but I was immediately discouraged by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters talk about the love that I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how hard he tried, he could not understand why Rohmer is so considered among moviegoers. I thought she was one of those unpleasantly petulant people who are full of hot air. If this is a sample of what your movies are, I'm not interested. I do not care much about French cinema (generally reflective and speculative to some extent), so it may be partial.
