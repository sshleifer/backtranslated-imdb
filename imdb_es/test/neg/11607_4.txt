The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character is, as another user said, "unnecessarily cruel". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, and was well played by Robert Montgomery, who is well dressed but at the same time very clumsy. The movie has some fun moments, especially when the character of Montgomery makes a great effort to try to get his "wife" back. Understandably, she is upset because the marriage is not technically legal, but she only discovers it three years later. <br /> <br /> The character of Lombard seems quite cold before the sincere attempts of his "husband" to court her. Although not very skilled in that effort, Montgomery, however, is visibly affectionate and yet, Lombard is as cool as a column of ice. There are almost no clues that suggest some kind of reconciliation between the couple at war for much of the movie, and it's hard to see some kind of comedy, even dark comedy, in that regard. To some extent, the film almost suggests a sadistic tone, with the character of Lombard getting a "kick" from her husband's weak efforts. While this other type of 'Battle of the sexes' movie could be considered, the reality is that it is a very crooked battle, if that: the Montgomery character, though certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to be a typical example of the masculine. chauvinist / misogynist (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in "The War of the Roses"). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed not only by Montgomery's sharp dress (which is probably largely due to the perennially dressed actor), but also by his discomfort in trying, but not in, playing the role of a womanizer bachelor. His only important defect is his vanity, but that failure does not compare with the excessive cruelty of his companion. And there is no suggestion that she is trying to inculcate jealousy for subconscious love. This is what makes him so cruel and sad. The character of Montgomery simply looks weak. Actually, no wife would want such a weak man unless she "wore the pants" in marriage. But once again, a woman who wears pants in a marriage will never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role from the beginning. Therefore, the whole subject seems strange. This film is not even a champion of feminism (Lombard's character shows some signs of the kind of woman of independent orientation of the 60s, but that idea soon vanishes and the character falls in the 1940s), nor a fair battle of The Sexes (since the character of Montgomery is truly an encryption of masculinity and, therefore, a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This film is, on the surface, a slapstick, but under that appearance it is much darker, with sadists. nuances All of which makes your resolution appear, well, odd. (Maybe that weirdness was the point?). In any case, slapstick this movie is not.
