Rating: * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of those movies that will not stay in your mind until the next hour. Well ... only if you keep thinking about how bad it is. It is a piece of mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable garbage. One of those adjectives that I just used is the reason that made me add 1/2 star to what I would have given. So, is it a case of 'so bad that it's good'? No. It's a case of 'so bad that it's ridiculous'. <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad acting, plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, she has no friends and her neighbors do not know her. Suddenly, she is involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing happens to her. Your identity, bank accounts, etc., etc., etc., are all deleted, and now it's Ruth Marx. The conspiracy involves even the government and ... Wait! Have not we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the 90s, showing the computer as a villain. What a thing! It's a movie about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the ship's accident. I laughed when the camera started to slow down ... <br /> <br /> What makes everything even worse here is Sandra Bullock. How horrible is she! Have you already made a decent movie? "A time to kill" is fine. But she is still a bad actress, repeating the movements of her robotic face in each of her images. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey", the best, most. Smart and more complex film ever made. It is not necessary to compare "The Net" with it, is it ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The Net" is to laugh, as I said, and to see what it is about. tried to be The results, well, are a pity. <br /> <br /> ELIMINATE this movie from your mind!
