In general, I really like Lawrence and being in Australia I have not seen much, so when I saw him in my video store I thought: yes, I'll take a look. I wish I had not seen him now. Obviously, Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his mind, and I think he wants to share this with others, but this was not the time or the place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience seemed like a motivating speech in hell. He really did. I think the phrase of the night was "to walk until the wheels fall," which was interspersed with simply lascivious jokes that revolved around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not understand. He does not care about raw humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift to classify it in the manner of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just lewd, the only time I laughed was when he revived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were negative points, I would give them ....
