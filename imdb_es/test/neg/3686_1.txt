I suffered the observation of this film at the Sitges Festival last month. If there was a possibility of "not filming" a film to avoid its existence, it should be first on the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a silly woman who pretends that holding a camera with her hand and shouting "action" turns her into a professional filmmaker. That mistake! The film itself does not make sense and is a total waste of good actors who could be doing something better on another project. Val Kilmer does nothing more than put his face in front of the camera. His character has no specific weight in the film. The same can be said of Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It is a shame how the character of Rade Serbedzija was written. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of his time alone in the tunnels talking to himself on the road (now I'm doing this, now I'm without bats, I'll search my bag, now I'm turning left, now I'm turning right ...) just to give the audience a clear idea about their actions. It is simply nonsense and demonstrates the director's lack of talent. END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of trash among the audience was that the title of the film itself brought the track about the rating that everyone should give: ZERO
