The best around the middle, when most of the characters get horny and chase someone they have not had before. It is around this point that we can see the majestic breasts of Susan Sarandon (albeit through a veil). Interestingly, Beverly D'Angelo, who is not shy about nudity, shows nothing at all, while Aida Turturro? of all people ?? make. At the other end of the spectrum, the less it is said that Walken plays a homosexual, the better. The film itself has little plot; the dialogues of the play and the "normal" dialogues are often crossed and that is not the kind of thing I would consider a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Occasionally, dialogue has something in its favor, but the film is prolonged.
