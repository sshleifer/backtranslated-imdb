I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (not consecutively, of course). I saw it at the local dollar theater when I was 11, and it was so outrageous that I almost went out; I do not think I realized that you could leave before the movie was over. Anyway, it stayed in my mind as the worst movie I saw growing up. Finally I can give it the rating it deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (that was strangely satisfying)
