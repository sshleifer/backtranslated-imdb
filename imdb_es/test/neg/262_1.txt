There is no - there are NO redeeming qualities for this movie. They did not verify a single fact, NOT ONE about ... nothing. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and much more for his agent for not being able to find a more suitable place for him. <br /> <br /> Adults are all idiots. The effects are cheesy and lack any sense of reality. The music is honestly corny. The plot is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something good with your family, see anything else. Take some time and check for mold in your attic. My ten-year-old daughter makes fun of this movie while we see her. Unfortunately, you are learning that not all movies are worth seeing.
