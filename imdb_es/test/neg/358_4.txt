Despite the fact that this was a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one in that: that is, cheap), CLASS WARFARE made me wish that I could recover my money, and considering that this limited production was partially financed through of Canadian dollars, you could have the right. <br /> <br /> What made me go through that was to see the actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I've seen for the past two years in her role as "goody goody" Mara Lewis in the telenovela GUIDING LIGHT, taking a turn to play "the bad girl" for a change. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, she is doing quite well, since Kristen, a rich and spoiled woman who suddenly finds herself very poor, but with a vein of connivance and a twist of fate, which will possibly change her luck. back. The twist of fate is found in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially radical outcast who discovers that he simply went from having nothing to winning $ 23 million on a lottery ticket. Now, put Richard, Kristen, his jock-boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter), and his colleague Graham (Dave McGowan), obsessed with the camcorder, together over the weekend in a remote cabin, separated from the world by the storms, and guess what. it develops. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from congesting both the story and the people and the characters' motives. Everyone is quite one-dimensional and you do not have to be a space scientist to realize that some things, and some people, are going to go very wrong, very quickly. I do not think this is such an original argument and do not go out of your way to do something else. The acting is fine, McKeon is the manipulative female lead, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too good at times, but it's not worth writing to anyone else. The only real credit that I can give to the film is the only turn I did not see at the end (although it is not the end, that is so obvious that it hurts). In any case, I sat through everything and lived to tell it, so I can not say it was a total cancellation. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A movie of the type "something to see when nothing else is on".
