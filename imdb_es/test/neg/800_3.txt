A box with a button gives a couple the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they have never met. This is a very tedious movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a movie without any reward. They take you on a journey of slow development, one after the other with minor revelations at best. At certain times, I thought to myself, this will have a great meaning in the end, but nothing has it. The film leaves only one thought: "This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the nonsense." I hope you avoid this horrible movie and maintain your sanity by doing so.
