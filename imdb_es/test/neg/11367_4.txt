Actually I liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and I would have liked to have that option in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really were not bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with, even if it was just a shooting game. The music was good. The things he hated were: the kind of movement that he aspired and aimed at was total pain. The story was too boring for words and too much of the same without originality. The inability to save was horrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought the weapons also stunk. This game is fun for a while, but it does not look like the first three and it's only good if you just want to shoot things. I would recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's it. Play at your own risk.
