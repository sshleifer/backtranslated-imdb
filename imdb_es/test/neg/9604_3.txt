All right! A science fiction / horror / action B hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we can see a cyborg with a metal head without killing killing several people! As with any Wynorski movie, he throws a lot of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly do not lead anywhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a two movie deal for the price of one. On the one hand, we got the drama / thriller part (as the movie begins) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying and ungrateful husband (a plot that simply does not lead anywhere). And, on the other hand, we got the 'Night of the living dead' style from the 'cyborg escaped in an uproar'. With Carol and the Cyborg are the trapped inside the house and a group of special operators / bounty hunters who play the role of zombies, trying to enter the house. Needless to say, this movie is not among the best. Zach Galligan (from "Gremlins" -fame) is especially bad and Corey Feldman (in a small support roll) is once again lost in this movie. Wynorski even starts one of his own films here, since I'm 99% sure he used some footage from his previous movie "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). Yes, it's not so good and so much fun. This is strictly for Wynorski fans only. And I am one of them, in case you did not already know.
