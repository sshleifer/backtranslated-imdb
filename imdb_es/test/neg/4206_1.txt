According to this movie, there are a number of ingredients at work: <br /> <br /> First, place them in mounds of mountain truckers: good guys who have a secret desire to take over the law. Second place in evil police of Hillbilly controlled by an outlaw raised in Texas. Third place in karate fight against the trucker played by Chuck Norris. Fourth put a foolish teenager like Norris' nephew captured by evil policemen from Hillbilly. Fifth show, Chuck Norris fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now mix everything and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre movie!
