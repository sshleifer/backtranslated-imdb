Of the four main players here, John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin, the only one I've ever heard of (at that time) was the one who bothered me most and ruined the movie. Well, she must have done a good acting job to make me want to throw her and the VHS in the trash can. I mean Kelly in the role of adolescent brat, "Tia Russell." Ironically, six years later, he played an impressive and extremely pleasant role in the person of "Rowena Morgan" in "Opus of Mr. Holland". <br /> <br /> Candy, as always, is fun to watch as "Buck Russell," or the title character, "Uncle Buck." Few actors were better at playing an adorable and miserable villain than Candy. I enjoyed his character here, but I can not see that spoiled teen more than once. In addition, in the first minutes of the film, the child "Miles" (Cauklin) says the word "Damn." How bad is that, to have a six-year-old boy saying the name of the Lord in vain in a movie? These Hollywood people are sick. It's no wonder that many of his children's actors become mentally fucked, since Caulkin is a good example.
