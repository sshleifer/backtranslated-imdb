It's amazing that there were two movies with the same story premiered in 2005. This one came out one day before the other with Tom Cruise. Did not they do that with Truman Capote the same year, and the zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> The writer / director David Michael Latt did not have the budget of Steven Spielberg and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we were invited to complain about Rhett Giles, who played a pastor who was surrendering. his God. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was creepy as an LT army.
