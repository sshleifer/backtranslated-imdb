For the first forty minutes or so, it's a pleasure to watch Luna. The characters and their situation are interesting and photography and places are beautiful to look at. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that her son Matthew Barry is using heroin and the film begins to fall apart and then becomes completely laughable in his illness. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asks her why and when she started using the drug and she and the audience did not. sometimes get a direct answer, which would be a little useful. He mentions that he does not care about anything, but that is not correct because we see clearly in the incredible early scenes that he has a lot of interest in singing, baseball, his mother's sex and, apparently, enough to reject marijuana. This film is for people who think that young people consume hard drugs because mom and dad were addicted to work and missed their piano recital. I think that a drug as dangerous and emotionally volatile as heroin was chosen as a kind of intellectual catalyst for the latest scenes of incest. There is a lot of discussion about the love of the mother for the son, but in reality it is about Bernardo Bertolucci being pretentious. Luna would have been great as a small and picturesque family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the strange things I had to do as an actor for this movie than for everything his character was going through. ** outside ****
