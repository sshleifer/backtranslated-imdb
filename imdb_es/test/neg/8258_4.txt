In "Letras rojos", Coyote is in the vortex of a university professor who writes to an inmate and gets more than she expected. There are two reasons to see this movie ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, although it is difficult for his sparks to shine in a disaster of such complete direction. Everything is wrong with the "red letters" ... twisted, bad script, camera, editing and, above all, performance that is unsatisfactory for Coyote, etc. It's not worth the time.
