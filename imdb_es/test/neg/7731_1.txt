I regret to say that I saw this movie in the theater the first time it came out, and it was one of the few movies I've always wanted to leave before. I did not have a problem with the contents of the drug and I could see how this warning could have been powerful. The problem was that the filmmaker, working with James Woods and Sean Young, drew two of the least adorable characters I've seen in the film. I hated this pair and would not have cared less if they sank directly into the inevitable bottom. It was not a surprise in this movie. Every turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt I could have written the script myself; Although I like to think that I would have done a better job. Later I heard nightmare stories about the incidents on the set between Sean Young and James Woods in the line of some kind of stalking events. It made me wonder if the terrible performance came from some bad feelings and dysfunctions. Anyway, I refer to The Boost as the worst movie I've paid money to watch.
