Of this bad version of Fatal Attraction that does not There is directing, not playing, just an unfortunate copy of the Adrian Lyne movie if you have doubts about suicide, see this and you can choose ... for "yes". <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the people who went to the movies to see this garbage; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose the first cinema near the house to stay 2 hours with others to forget the problems, but it is difficult to return home relaxed
