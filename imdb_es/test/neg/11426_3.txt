Because I never would have seen this movie until the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie, I could not understand more than 15% (the elegant English couple in the third story included) of what people said. Three stories, none with a real point, with only some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a lot of rude language. He did not find it funny, he did not find it funny, he did not find any sense in it. 4/10
