First of all, I personally love Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was difficult to find good horrors without a good official movie distributed here in Russia when I was a child, and that is an immutable part of my childhood. Then I did not hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it's certainly not a good comeback! Why was the main character, whom we never knew as at least like him, accidentally in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say such stupid and silly things about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Have not we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us until now. It is a shame.
