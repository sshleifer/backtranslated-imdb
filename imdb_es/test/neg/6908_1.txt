Hi, I usually love movies. I am 19 years old, I have seen many and I do not like one or two. This, however, the second that ended, I had to get my sister (who had wanted to see her) by the arm and burst into tears of laughter as soon as I left because it was a ridiculously horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was horrible: - all the cows had udders, especially annoying were the MUCHS with udders - none of the characters were unique or attractive, except maybe the main Coyote Dag - the idea of ​​having cows to see against the coyotes is simply ridiculous: the "funny" moments are repetitive and simply become a sequence to overcome the last: the issues of working together, which should have been present at the end, were non-existent. Instead, people have the impression: well, I'll take care of all this, and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge, all the moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were incredible , even for a children's film <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... PARALLISE TO THE KING LION OF EVERY HAND Unique figure of a responsible father who is killed by Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially the Hyenas, with Dag, the leading Coyote, is the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, although basically Simba) wants to play, and is surprised that his father has died, he believes it was his fault (despite that in this movie, it was his fault), he confronts the Coyotes and he starts pounding, after which Dag tells him to leave, and about to leave, Odis somehow decides to go save some chickens and their friends. above (for complete surprise, of course, he leaves without knowing that they will come to help him). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from the Lion King: stars that move as signs, father figures that refer to stars / signs in a mystical and loving way, the obvious circularity of how Father Ben found Odis and He took care of it, and how, in the end, the love interest of Odis gives birth and has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even music of a similar kind, which seems completely added at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first movie I do. I have ever seen where I was really encouraging the bad guys, I never understood what other people were saying, until now. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Do not waste time to go see this. Convince the children so they do not see it, and look again at the Lion King. Either that, or take them to see Ant Bully, who was creative and artistic.
