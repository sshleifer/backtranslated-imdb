The only reason I saw this is due to its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare & Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, all the capable actors and have performed well in the past. NOT THIS TIME, a weak story of serial killers, you can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Very well thought out in all aspects, there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
