Considering the film's reputation as the worst of the worst, I expected to see Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); It's not necessarily more inept than the other Woods I've seen; however, being the film school REEFER MADNESS (1938), GLEN OR GLENDA are not as easy to "enjoy" as their gender efforts. <In addition, this surely emerges as the nadir of horror legend Bela Lugosi (his first of the three 'collaborations' with the director): one wonders if he really was aware of what kind of film he was (considering the story of the actor of heavy medication and the absolute lack of sense of his cameo). In addition, the idiosyncratic delivery of Lugosi is perhaps the most uncomfortable here ... although Wood's script is mainly to blame for this, given the impossible dialogue (with repeated pointless allusions to "puppy tails" and "large, thick snails"). ") handed him the disease. star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis), and, being equally useless in this area, he proves to be a complete dog! Dolores Fuller, his wife and co-star, also had no talent (he would also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but, at least, the image in which the latter finally lets Glen wear his angora sweater gave the loving Tim Burton Biopic ED WOOD (1994) His famous poster! <br /> <br /> By the way, this latest film presents a supposedly fictitious meeting between Wood and Orson Welles; Well, for all intents and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA constitutes CITIZEN KANE (1941) by Ed Wood given his cheerful propensity for sophisticated narrative. Techniques: in fact, the simplest thread of the plot is filled with abundant archival material (many of them irrelevant, such as the disconcerting instances of S & M) and sequences of inane dreams (highlighted by the presence of an impious demon having fun in the thick eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese cries of envy)! However, the film's sincere attempt to ask for tolerance and psychological inquiry into the affliction / phenomenon of transvestism is sabotaged at all times by the simple fondness of the approach. <br /> <br /> For its value, the edition I saw the extended edition of the reissue that included six minutes of "depraved" images (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored in the original release! Also, my copy got out of sync from time to time (which forced me to rewind it slightly to put the audio back on track), although, fortunately, this was the fault of converting the source to DivX instead of the movie itself . .
