Bored soap opera, totally predictable. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is a friend of Lahti and does not know anything about the traps. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with her baby. YAWN! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I paid money to see this in a theater in 1986. I liked the three stars, but even their considerable talents could not make it. CONSTANT I knew what was going to happen. As another poster said, this is interpreted as a Lifetime movie rated by PG. <br /> <br /> He has Lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even Moore is released once! There are also useless shots of topless women playing football (!!!). Apart from that, it is friendly for television. The only good thing about this was that Timothy Gibbs played the teenage son of Moore and Danson. Very handsome and quite good actor. Apart from that, there is nothing I recommend. You've seen it before ... and you've done it better. Obviously he has forgotten. Skip it.
