Standard "Outbreak of disease in a remote area, the expert who spends holidays in the area takes over" the film. There are only a few deviations from the norm. One is that the children involved are quite reasonable from the start. In general, they are monsters that repeatedly ruin the works until they are redeemed at the end. Another is that the local healer who is normally an impediment from the beginning is never discounted or completely redeemed at the end. Perhaps, since this seems to have been done for the faith-oriented PAX channel, they did not want to seem too critical of the faithful. Finally, there were no evil local politicians / entertainment companies trying to cover up the whole affair. The lack of these stereotypes was refreshing: if we have to thank the PAX channel, you may have to try some more of their offers. Apart from that, however, this was quite standard. You've seen everything before.
