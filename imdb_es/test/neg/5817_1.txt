I am a great lover of B movies really bad. And especially I love the alien / science fiction movies. I say that the cheaper, more cheesier and more campier, the better. A low budget and a hokey idea are funny enough for most of B's ​​bad movies, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed by the people who made the film and by the impromptu actors of Schlocky. First of all, there is no real plot, it's all kind of "comedy" situation (if you can call it that). The "comedy" in this movie is more about characters who say, in essence, "look at me, I'm in this crazy situation, is not this funny?" But it's pathetic because nothing anyone is doing is so funny. There is not a comedian's ability, nor a rampant plot to take all the unimaginative scenarios through this sad mess. acting, the actors saying really stupid things over and over again (maybe trying to imitate phrases, maybe just because everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women played as hot girls, and people who bark and faint in baths. <br /> <br /> There was a middle-aged actor towards the end of the movie who, he knew, had some acting skills and was quite convincing in his role. It was as out of place as a solid BM in the bathroom of a weekend detox unit. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (luckily we did not have to put up with it anymore), and he was filmed off-site, probably outside his apartment somewhere. He said some really funny things about extraterrestrials and having sex with aliens, and that was the magnitude of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and the 90 minutes (and the years of pain when remembering) you will lose seeing this garbage, avoid it. If you consume a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler's comedy styles (and, therefore, do not have standards), and we consider you mentally slow, this movie might like you. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think people who got excited about this should work for Troma or something, because I can not believe that people can be so lame as to really enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really ruin your judgment so much?)
