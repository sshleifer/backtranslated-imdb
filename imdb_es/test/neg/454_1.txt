From the weeks and weeks of promotion to this, ABC's "The One" was supposed to be "The Real World" and "American Idol." We were going to see these singers play, compete and see how they lived together in a house as well. The drama! The tension! <br /> <br /> Where does one start with this atrocity? Let's start with the "judges" who were known as "Music Experts" in this program. "Experts" implies that they have experience. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a while. The other two ... eh. The uncle of Kate Hudson, who could have been labeled as Mr. Weird Beard. The facial hair was dyed with three clearly different fluorescent colors. I wonder what fear I would have had with a black light! And the aspiring Paula Abdul, who did something she did not think could happen: she was even more effusive and cloying than Paula! Then he over corrected himself and became severely critical after the first episode. The farce of the "critics" that these three offered was a real joke and an insult, not only to the process of finding the best singer, but to the audience that is now quite intelligent, since it has done it many times in Fox. < Br /> <br /> I was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, it was as lackluster as it can be. In fact, he sucked the little energy that was in the program, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the program. <br /> <br /> The first was how did you choose the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talent show without talent. IN AGREEMENT. Maybe that's an exaggeration. And granted, all artists have to have a relatively close ability, because if they were not, there would not be a "contest". If only one person were "good", there would be no "suspense". So, I understand that everyone needed to be comparable. But everyone should have had * some * chops! In addition, the judges ran a "singing academy", so the program was also part of "Fama". Clearly these artists desperately needed those lessons. But you need extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that was definitely not what was happening here. <br /> <br /> It seemed that in the casting of the program, the priority was in the elements of the "home", since all the players were very attractive to see, in equal conditions. Parts of how badly they vocalized. But the segments filmed in his house were so cut and cut that you could not get into the stories that were beginning to happen, so the show did not capture the events there either. <br /> <br /> So bad Conceived as all that, "The One" had an incredible design flaw, incredible and fatal integrated into the results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The audience phoned their votes so they would like it better. , as in "AI". But then, once the audience vote was revealed, the three contestants in the fund were forced to sing a final song. The "music experts", based on that performance, chose one person out of the three to save for the following week. AND THEN, the contestants who were safe voted for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, sending the remaining contenders home. <br /> <br /> The "design flaw" was that the contestants had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music contest and you wanted to go as far down the road as you could, would you vote to KEEP the best singer or try to get rid of your toughest opponent? Any spectator of the first season of "Survivor" of CBS could respond to that! And that is exactly what happened in the program. The person who had the best potential was lost and the participants answered "the only one" who had no talent at all. In addition to that, the contestant who was saved from the fund by the "experts" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Maybe if they let the contestants vote first, at least the "experts" could save the best of the two evils to finish. But this only confirms how little was ready for the transmission of this program, how unsatisfactory it was to see the whole process and how wrong the producers were when trying.
