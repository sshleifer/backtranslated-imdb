I bought Jack-O several months ago in a Blockbuster video sale, and at that time I did not expect anything outstanding. When I saw it, I realized that I not only got less than I could have bought, but also much more. It seems, strange, I know. And it is. But it is perfectly appropriate when you consider the absolute rarity that is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> The movie follows a boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, through ancestral ties, it is marked for death at the hands of a Pumpkin man with a demented scythe. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's great-grandfather, his uncle-cousin, etc., and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is seemingly crucial to his mission of vengeance raised by hell. Anyway, there is a lot of "horror" when Jack-O makes his way through several neighbors before fighting Shawn until the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not here to discuss the plot as to determine who can do it. Find any value in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the worst movies in the history of time. The performance is inexpressive (except when it should), the script is apparently a first-grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous scenes of death take place in this anti thriller, and they are even more comical when you realize that director Steve Latshaw seems really serious in his movie making. <br /> <br /> And, however, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say that I had a great time seeing him with my friends, and I've seen him several times since that fateful first visit. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this film intolerable and without the need for time, and that is understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that are taken seriously, you'll find Jack-O as an instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. . If I rated the quality of Jack-O as a movie, I would not give it anything. In fact, the studio owed me stars. However, if I rated it on the basis of pure enjoyment, I would give it an 8 or a 9. I will give it a 4, to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone to come out, remember this and form your own conclusion.
