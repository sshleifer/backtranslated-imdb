The only entertaining thing I found when I saw this movie was listening to Star Wars go through the movie wall (yes, I go to a very bad cinema). This movie is so foolish that I think I'd rather have a cat scratch my eyes instead of seeing it again. <br /> <br /> Let's compare it with the original one. One is charming, fun, exciting, well acted, and one of the best movies that have been made, the other is so far from fun that all you can do is wait for your eyes to fall so you do not have to see more . I'm sorry, Christina Ricci is a good actress, but she can not compare to Hailley Mills, and I do not even mean Doug E. Doug in a part occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. The small part of Dean Jones in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and that is the only reason why I can justify a 1 * rating (also because the imdb does not enter the negatives).
