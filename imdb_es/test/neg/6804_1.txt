I really had not heard much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only attracts someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think that this movie was moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa Clash That scene, the dialogue, was great. And then the movie went downhill. <br /> <br /> While I respect the vision that the filmmaker should have, this film stunk. He was too slow, too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit on. It tries to be shocking and abnormal, but it misuses the talents of all the actors. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
