Let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, period! The performances vary from theater theater (Marla English) to a walk through "I do not care" (Tom Conway). Photography (even on a good impression) is so murky that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. The real problem, however, is the story without direction, without meaning, almost without plot, and the direction of lead and meaningless. At a speed of 77 minutes, it still feels infinite. <br /> <br /> The script is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the end of the image. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) that he can control telepathically. He keeps his wife prisoner (without any discernible reason). Meanwhile, a couple of petty criminals and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the town they are working in, in expectation of gold and jewelry. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. She becomes a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And then returns to normal. He sees a golden statue half-drowned in a boiling pond, tries to retrieve it and falls into the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the wife. In the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; Threatening with a sequel (that's a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> The producer of AIP, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a conference included in the DVD, is proud to detect the niche of adolescent market and satisfy it witty low-budget films. However, it is difficult to see how anyone would think that this rancid mixture would satisfy any type of audience. How attractive do you think you could have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror movie. The action of the jungle is warm and tedious. There are no teenagers and there are no characters that you can expect to identify with. <br /> <br /> The producers exposed 77 minutes of the film, but they did not make a film. This is a deception and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with him.
