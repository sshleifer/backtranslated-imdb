This is one of those exaggerated comedies full of stars that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth extracted. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic "b". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented on "Town and Country" which is a big problem in Hollywood that starts with hiring the actors and the agreement. before a script is completed. We must realize that not only did they enter this image without a complete script, but they also destroyed it daily. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studios that say: "It's the script, stupid." <br /> <br /> This is also one of those movies where you feel sorry for most of the actors. They are working hard to make all this look hysterical, but they know that most of this will not be accompanied by stomach laughter, but by the sounds of crickets you can hear inside the silent theater. <br /> <br /> Is it an absolute disaster? Not completely. There are some smiles along the way, mainly due to the efforts of the actors. Probably would have left the theater thinking: "Eh. I was fine." So why the tone undeniably hostile in my criticism? The end. If, as has been pointed out, the rest of the film is only a configuration for the end, it is lost in a spectacular way. I would really like to be able to talk specifically about that, but I hate people who give too much away (even in warning). Suffice it to say that, as soon as you see John Goodman behind Paul Reiser (he does not give away anything here, he's in the trailer), jump out of the cinema and come out to think "Hey, it was okay." The rest of the movie is stuck and creatively bankrupt. And you'll be surprised that there really will be people laughing at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you loved "There Something About Mary" or "Meet The Parents" (both BIG movies), then do not bother watching this movie. Go to have those teeth taken care of instead.
