Does anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? - Or what does it matter to them? - I doubt it. That is the key problem: for a tragedy to work we have to worry about at least one of the characters and none of them inspires sympathy or seems to have any redeeming quality. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the sixteenth century, certainly does not work in one, you can only assume 'Liverpool apocalyptic' if that is what it was supposed to be. The problem is that post-apocalyptic Liverpool characters, while still driving in cars, used mobile phones and watched television, they spoke again in Shakespearian language, with a Heppudlian dialect. Oh darling! It's bad enough that you can think, but this has often turned into pure chatter, with comments like 'eh lah, are you a cockney? And was that a Merseyrail ad during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well, the good news is that in Liverpool's apocalyptic Post, the trains are still running. <br /> <br /> The characters, without exception, are badly drawn, they are made of wood and more like caricatures in the lines of the Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin. except that there is no real story to talk about, or if there is one, it is one that does not work in a modern environment where half of the sets are somber and 'Runnerish Blade' and the other half are flashy or simply normal fluorescent XXI century . The costumes are also mixed with half of using their everyday clothes (the Parkers are big in post-apocalyptic Liverpool, apparently) and the other half with disguises from the remains of a costume party. <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most insane way imaginable: the tragedy is that this movie was made at all. <br /> <br />
