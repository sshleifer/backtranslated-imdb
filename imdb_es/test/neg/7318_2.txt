Oh boy This movie is so mediocre that I do not know what to write exactly about it. <br /> <br /> I think it's easier to write what it is not: <br /> <br /> It's not very entertaining. It's not original. And there's not a single character in the whole movie that I care about. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a certain TV reality show on MTV, but without interesting people. It simply goes on again and again and I can hardly wait for it to end. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was Jennifer Lyons (c: <br /> <br /> I thought for a long time in this movie to find something good to say, what I liked was the reminder not to do it. the first impression he receives (as Holly did when he accused Nicole) that gives him a score of 2 out of 10 instead of 1.
