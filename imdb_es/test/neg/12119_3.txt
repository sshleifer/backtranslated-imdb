I loved the latest Bellocchio movie, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". I had a great script, great actors (well, I have to say that Castellitto is much bigger than others), an excellent use of lights for a great cinematography. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. A ridiculous script that pops tons of morale (and we could talk about politics weeks, you know we're Italians ...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple, representing the dark years of the 70s with dark colors and dark lights, make more effort on the part of the people!). Misuse of music: what is the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And to all the people who claimed the main prize in Venice, I answer them: "Are you crazy?" Maybe the Russian movie was bad but not as bad as this one. <br /> <br /> I'm down with P.E. Do not believe advertising
