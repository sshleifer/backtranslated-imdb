I have seen several Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately, and I have found many that I like about them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed much milder than all the others I've seen. Maybe it's because it's a comedy / horror movie instead of a direct horror, and maybe also because humor did not register very well with me. <br /> <br /> It's a little less than seventy minutes, and the credits start when the last ten minutes start. There are some shots, nonsense and things behind the scenes while those credits accumulate. <br /> <br /> SRE movies tend to be short and tend to feel shortened in spite of that. This is not an exception, with some scenes that tend to last too long. <br /> <br /> The story involves a poor boy in Christmastown, California, who had been chosen by all his classmates. They had stolen a shoe and, unable to replace it, they called it "Oneshoe McGroo". Due to an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him a patch for Christmas with a Christmas tree adorned with the patch. <br /> <br /> Many of the classmates are murdered, and the few who remain gather to decide what to do. do. They are selected one by one by McGroo, who approaches the sound of sleigh bells. <br /> <br /> The characters are practically all general stereotypes, like the nerd named Dorkus, etc. There is a strange scene in which a perverse couple has sex; The woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man carries a large slice of paper watermelon on his head. This reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes of director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is good and there are many extras. But basically a pretty silly movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still, there are many other vacations needed.
