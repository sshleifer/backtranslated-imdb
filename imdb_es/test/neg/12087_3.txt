THE GOVERNESS is an article in a bad mood, the meandering story of a Jewish woman who, after the death of her father, goes to the Scotland of 1830 and pretends to be a Gentile to get a job to support her family in London. <br /> <br /> Rosina, or Mary, as she calls herself in a symbolic writing not too subtle, is a girl without a rudder, a socialite with dreams of being an actress. She establishes an alliance with her employer and, by accident, solves a crucial problem in her research with photography. Stunned by success, they begin an uncomfortable and uncomfortable adventure while their lover's oldest son falls irremediably (and inexplicably) in love with her. <br /> <br /> And as a child, you do not understand the consequences of it. Actions: in the end, betray those who cheated to make a life. <br /> <br /> Many claim that this is a kind of feminist manifesto, but I do not agree. Whether it is planned or not, this movie only resonates with me if I think of it as a warning story. In the end, Rosina's biggest disappointment is the truth: that she lied, found a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover, and in the end it only contributed to the destruction. As such, the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did, no one used, made her happy, and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Did I need a movie for so long? And langorous to teach me this lesson? No way. On the contrary, if it had not been for an excellent photograph, a unique score and my hope that she would get her improvement, I would not have stayed with her until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver fans will probably be disappointed by their uneven performance, but may wish to see it anyway; I doubt that the young fans of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers can stay awake for the reward they expect, and I can not help thinking that this has too little cultural detail to be of interest, even for photography fans. The 3 points that I give to the film are only for their visual style and score. In the strength of his other work, I assume that the performances of the actors are so disappointing due to a poor script and a worse direction, but in the end they are not at all remarkable.
