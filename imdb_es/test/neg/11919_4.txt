Having no idea what this movie was about, but the fact that John Leguizamo appeared in it, we decided to see it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another comment in this forum says, we feel embarrassed by the actors who participated in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not in any way horrible, it does not make sense at all. The high performance of William Baldwin does not help either to improve the situation. John Leguizamo is an actor with multiple talents who deserved better. The basic problem that seems to be the film was a project that began with good intentions to make a small comedy and the people in charge were left without ideas on the way. The result is an uneven movie.
