My friend Zac rented this movie without charge since his mother works in a rental store. I still feel cheated, since I will never be able to recover those 100 minutes of my life. After having seen the first "Dark Harvest" the night before this visualization, I expected at least to see a shitty remake of the first movie. Incorrect. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scarecrow in the movie (unless you count the one on the cover of the box), nor are there real death scenes. The film earned the R rating of an 8-year-old girl who shouted at her father "God and ** n". <br /> <br /> There is no amount of tequila that can make this movie bearable. Believe me, we tried.
