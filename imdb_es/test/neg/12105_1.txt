Almost a master class on how not to direct a movie. From the badly judged script, often incomprehensible in the future, Dr. Rey is based on a series of bad decisions that make the film an unbearable visual experience. Unfortunately, the film never rises beyond a kind of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp, in which women are very forged, OTT and middle-aged and men are young, empty and always in search of sex. The director could not release the tone of the film or the level of the performances. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a lot of "acting" going on. Dianne Wiest slips in a pale imitation of her performance of Bullets Over Broadway and poor Jane Birkin in her attempt to offer a comedic performance. Although you must have pity, since there is very little real comedy here. Everything feels like a very low rent version of Le Divorce de Merchant Ivory which, to be honest, was not very good either.
