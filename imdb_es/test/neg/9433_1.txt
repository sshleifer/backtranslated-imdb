"But what comes to mind is a film so disjointed and unlikely that it seems a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live.The monotone tone does not match so much with the sense of humor, and underlines the fact that it was spent a lot money in a vehicle for Jason Priestly to happily destroy his image as a nice boy, who is not even successful because he plays His character is not like a nerd, but like a laconic zombie A nerd can be naive, but a nerd has passion. for the things directed inwards, but Priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost the anti-Forrest Gump Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" does not have the sense of reach to really be the anti-Forrest Gump. <br /> < Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) performs well as always, and Kimberly Williams does the best he can with what he has to work on, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO's Larry Sanders Show) pretty much missed of in her role as friend of Cosmo. Although probably not for long. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked up and it's only a matter of time before he is given a meaty role, hopefully making a team tag with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
