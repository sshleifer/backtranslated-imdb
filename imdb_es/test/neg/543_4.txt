I struggle to see the point of this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy but I did not laugh once. The story is a story that could have been interesting in a well made movie, but since it's about comics, the result is totally incredible (as comedies should be). The series of comic strips was very unpredictable, even after the episodes, and it is fair to say that all the people involved have done more important things. One to avoid. I also just discovered that the comments should be 10 lines long. The central point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the film is worth watching: do not write a forceful essay or disarm it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, young people, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you will want to pass this on. On the other hand, if you like the bad jokes that can be found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching this!
