This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up drenched in sweat, shouting "I did not make this movie, please do not blame me!" Honestly, I think it would have been more entertaining to see a fat guy eating lard in his mother's basement for an hour or two, to see this shit. I understand that money was scarce, but damn what the hell they thought there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. This movie needs a warning "Please, for the love of God, do not fund the drama department of the local JC." On another note, these are the least pleasant characters I've seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler in them. So, finally, take my advice the next time you think about renting this, just take out a few hundred Adivl and let the dream come.
