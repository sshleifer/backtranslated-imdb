Therefore, it has come to this. In the best-rated commentary on this film, someone says "Nishi is an honorable man". Really? This is a guy who mainly kills and mutilates people in the movie. He takes a short break to steal a bank. Honorable? How would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls that honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says "we can say that he is constantly thinking". How can we do that? Well, you know that joke "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer lies?" ... "His lips move." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I guess that means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. Existentalism supposedly emphasizes that an individual assumes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Ask the yakuza for money. What, they want it back? Kill them The cops find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honorable.
