The role of Buddy Ackerman is not exaggerated for Kevin Spacey. He has played the version of that character many times other, better movies. This is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this meaningless little farce. The script leaves little time for the development of the plot or the character, it resembles a porn movie in its rush to get to the "good things". The difference is that here the "good things" are not people who take pleasure in each other but cause pain, so it is appropriate for young adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's nothing wrong with a porn movie if you want to Observe people who have sex, and I guess there's nothing wrong with "Swimming with sharks" if you want to see people subjected to physical, emotional and psychological torture. But if you're looking for an incisive satire, interesting characters or anything else that even tries to involve you more than your most basic passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
