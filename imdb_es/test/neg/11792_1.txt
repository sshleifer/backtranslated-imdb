Why, oh, why did I waste my time watching this movie? They gave it to me in a video by a friend and I thought I would see it, surely it can not be that bad. In the first place, the acting is simply appalling and we are supposed to believe that this is real. Secondly, this film is trying shamelessly to copy the project of Blair's witch (yawn) and she does it very badly. So if you want the fright of your life, I would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be much more terrifying. but, if you just wanted to laugh, maybe the general stupidity of this movie would be enough. But in general, I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a lot of alcohol before watching it. the best part? It's only about an hour and a half, thank God.
