This film is pathetic not because it is misdirected, performed, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it is really difficult to ruin a movie with an ABBA soundtrack. However, unfortunately, this is the only thing that the film achieves. The musical performances in the movie, SouthPark, were much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you do not need talent to be a director. All you need are ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a taste of the horrible: an aged Meryl Streep is filmed with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and simply ruining the song with all the wrinkles that distract his face. Why do that to one of the most talented actresses?
