The film career of Steven Segal is a tribute to horrible cinema. I got tragically bored with each of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unreal than those of Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone else noticed that he never gets hit? I mean, give me something to root ... a tough battle with a bad boy that is scary. Twenty years and he is still filming the same fight scenes. Fighting scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act. The boring choreography of a Segal film highlights his painful lack of ability to act. Worse yet, unfortunately it is out of shape. Just what we need, a rigid fat man who believes he is an important man. There is not a jot of cinematic redemptive value in all these films of about ninety minutes. DO NOT look at this unless you feel like losing an hour and a half of your life.
