Every movie that I have PPV was because Leonard Maltin praised it because the heavens have collapsed! All and each one! When will I learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is an exaggerated Old Bag who does not think of saying she is dying of breast cancer to get away with it! Laura is an unbearable Medusa full of The Holy Spirit (and her husband's protege)! Caught between these harpies is the dumb child like a medusa of Medusa to whom The Old Bag has pressed the servants through the brush! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily removed from my discomfort when The Old Bag sunk her head in a sink, but, unfortunately, she did not die. I got up temporarily from my discomfort again when Medusa was knocked down, but, unfortunately, she did not die. It should be a capital offense to torture audiences in this way! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter to kick him, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically protrude from their sockets. Julie Walters' landscape chewing (especially the scene in which she "interprets" God) is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold hits some bimbo instead of Maude. For that, I am really grateful. And if you're reading this, Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
