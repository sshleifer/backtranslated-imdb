Not that I came in expecting much of that, but at least I expected a funny and stupid big-budget movie. This is not even that. This article is in the lower half of all the vampire movies I've seen (and believe me, I've seen many of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, little or no thought, almost nonexistent plot (and that's what semi-trucks can drive through the holes in). Sure, it has action and it's noisy, and it has more action, and more noise, and blood, and action ... These things alone are not a good movie (not even half decent). I'm surprised that some people can say that this is the best vampire movie ever made, all I can assume is that they have not seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.
