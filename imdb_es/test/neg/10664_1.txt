In Bollywood it is not uncommon for worthless films to become hits, good movies fail and good actors do not do it big. <br /> <br /> AKS is a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> After a music director and the singer tested the man from hell, only because his songs became a success that means he will then become an actor <br /> <br /> The producers They were sure that the movie will work, the songs were also a success and, of course, Himesh did his thing. Cheap advertising as usual <br /> <br /> The movie tells such a poor story, such bad direction, such a bad performance that makes you tremble <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, Stunts by Himesh and a lot of stupidity Himesh's cap is intact, even when he's in the car, he gives a somersault <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music is the grace of salvation, although most of the songs sound equal <br /> <br /> Himesh tries hard, but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, he lacks expressions, he is the most suitable for his musical director and a bit of singing He cuts an unfortunate picture Hansika is horrible Malika is well Sachin Khedekar is fine, Dars ha ha ha Jhariwala
