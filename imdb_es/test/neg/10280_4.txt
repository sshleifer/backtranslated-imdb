I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a long time. I have always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert, but for some reason (now quite clear), this movie is never shown on television or I miss it if it is ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, now I know why the movie rarely shows: it's because it's not so good. In fact, I would say it is a disaster. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a director for the first time and it shows. The film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing that holds it together. More like a collection of randomly linked short films. The film can be reduced to this: introduction (murder); police and girlfriend together; introductory credits; police officers go to work; The crazy guy tells the story; the policeman finds the body; policeman and boss and girlfriend at the bar; chase scene The scenes just do not flow together. They are very distinctively independent from each other and, because of this, characterization is weak, amateur limit. The scene in the bar with the bride, the scene on the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the Boss shouting at each other were worth shrinking. I almost stopped the movie during those (horrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is evident throughout the film. The style, like the 1970s, is on the whole map. The credits introduction scene makes the film look like a commercial for law enforcement. Then it tries to be a movie of friends (Big John and Zipper) and then a mystery of murder; then a melodramatic love story; A film does not have to have a particular style to be successful, but I'm afraid that the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confusing. It can be clearly seen that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateur, it looks extremely professional (and deceptively). The cinematography is impressive. Each painting is worthy of an exhibition in an art gallery. Or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful appearance of the film gives more credibility to the final product than it really deserves. And thanks to the performance of Robert Blake (of a character really badly written), the film maintains a certain level of realism, but nothing else makes much sense. The surprising thing about the appearance and composition of the film is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. The introductory credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. The scenes of Johnny disguising himself, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of American Gigolo. Oddly enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary feel, due to the impressive visual effects, even if the history and philosophy behind it are totally outdated. <br /> <br /> Therefore, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a film that is notoriously underestimated and overlooked because it obviously influenced many future filmmakers when it comes to appearance and composition. Very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall should take full credit. But, on the other hand, EGIB also deserves to be forgotten because of the poor characters, the confused story and the confusing direction, none of which is worth remembering.
