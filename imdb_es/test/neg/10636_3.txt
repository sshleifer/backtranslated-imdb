I just saw this at TCM tonight and I was surprised by the excessive performance of Jean Arthur. His eyes were surprised and, in general, the excess of work was not the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in his moderation and at the comical moment. She being the best thing in this movie. Wilder's gags were flat and, frankly, more like something a college freshman would write trying to "get away" from being evil, witty and dirty, but it just sounded boring and not at all funny. It seemed that the mood was being pushed too hard to be fun. The end was totally artificial. <br /> <br /> SPOILER FORWARD: I never thought for a moment that Art Lund would suddenly fall out of love with Dietrich and then suddenly be madly in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Be realistic! 3 out of 10
