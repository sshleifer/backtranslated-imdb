For me, it's an enigma how this type of movie got distribution. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's horror and there are a lot of nudes, but by God, the production value is the lowest I've seen, the equipment used is worse than the standard home equipment, everything is illuminated , which gives everything an amateur aspect, which makes us think of the worst home videos in the United States or what that program was called ... <br /> <br /> Please, people too much to ask Do you really make an effort when you expect to lose 90 minutes of people's lives to see this? You really should have done some short projects first because it's obvious that you're a group of amateurs! 1/10
