I bought this movie with the hope that it was another great killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and I expected to see the same here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the movie was not terrifying at all, and the only time we really see Pinocchio "alive" are the last scenes of the movie. The girl in the movie, her acting is so bad that it's almost laughable. In addition, the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what led them to put the girl in an asylum or where she was at the end of the film. So, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the "killer toy" genre. If you want a good series of killer toys, stick with the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of time and money.
