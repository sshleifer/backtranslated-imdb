Dramatic? Yes ... historically accurate? Not Quite! .... This film twists the details of the Bible about the flood by locating Lot and Noah during the construction of the Ark. Fascinating time travel for Lot made in part by NBC! ... Lot was not born until 2136 BC, 234 years AFTER the flood (2370 BC) ... That's like having George Bush with William Shakepeare! And what about this guy who is selling articles and nicknames to Noah? <br /> <br /> You can make a movie based on dramatic historical facts, but do not try to put people where they were not ... especially when it comes to the Word of God.
