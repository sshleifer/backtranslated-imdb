Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names with blood and fire on the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for a short year struck terror in the hearts of sailors and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London ... <br /> <br /> Hmm, that opening to the movie sounds like we're insane, looting, a movie ripper, is not it? Well, it is not. Although it is not totally worthless as a piece of curiosity. Philip Dunne and Arthur Caesar adapt Anne Of The Indies, by 20th Century Fox, from a story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. The direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing photography in Technicolor. Jean Peters is in the titular roll of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and the support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally meant to be based on The True Pirate of Life Anne Bonny, the film ultimately becomes the story of a woman who seeks identity and finds herself predominantly in the world male of piracy and marine shenanigans. Filled with clich√©s and more familiar pieces, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely failing. Peters gives the go-ahead, and Paget illuminates the screen with an effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although little used, actually sees the part and does not overreact as the rest of the male cast does. Some critics have tried desperately to delve into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, simply because it is Tourneur in the director's chair. But there is no depth here, this is simply a job for Tourneur, a bestowed professional, but it is very well drawn and actually lacks money to go with the buckle in action bets. <br /> <br /> Disposable at best. 4/10
