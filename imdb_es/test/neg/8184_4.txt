I have barely managed to see the whole movie ... Only after approximately 85 minutes of the 110 minutes of the film did the trip to Mars begin, and then there were 5 minutes left for the closing. These 85 long minutes were VERY boring and did not contribute anything to the movie. When it finally arrived on Mars, the plot was not much better. Everything could have been installed in a much shorter execution time and nothing would have been lost. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand is the piece of trivia that says that because of the movie, the newborn babies were named "Aelita" ... Why would someone want to name their baby after a villain, who despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here are the sets and costumes of The scenes of Mars. They are an interesting experiment in constructivism, just like "Dr. Caligari's cabinet" was for Expressionism, five years before. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for the great looking design ...
