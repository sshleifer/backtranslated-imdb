We think that this was one of the worst movies in history. I had to volunteer to see the end. The romance was not credible; the characters were not developed; the love story hardly made sense; It was a mistake and the scenery was absolutely stupid because it was (in my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION ... just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and OUTERBANKS does not typically resemble those houses in surfing; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it were not for them. Besides ... it was not realistic. the Hurricanes warn you very carefully to close the hatches. <br /> <br /> Also the friend was superfluous; and it did not coincide with the story. What did the civil war have to do with the external banks anyway? I also have to mention the costumes ... D. Lane had to wear a scarf / pashmina / shawl in every scene? It was exaggerated. He looked well enough not to have to hide things; without making them obvious as with light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm worried about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to get rid of this stupidity, and I mean the movie STUPID !!!! Do not be fooled by this! We did it. You can not even see it.
