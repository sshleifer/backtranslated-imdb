The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to unite the episodes and advance the story. The plot moves slowly. With few exceptions (for example, Graham Greene), the performance had no inspiration and, at best, was pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in mind, apart from the scene they were in. It is boring to watch a man driving a car through the semi-desert country on the stage of this film, whether he drives well or badly. Such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video. So there was nothing in this video to attract or attract the observer, to care about the characters and what came out. I am doubly disappointed because I rented this film based on the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and the writer of the novel on which it was based (Hillerman). I note that the jeweler reports that PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as Carlton International, provide the funds. I hope this video is as disappointing for them as it was for me and my wife, to the point that they will not fund more disasters from the same source.
