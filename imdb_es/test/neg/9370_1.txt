All he has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their options and points of view, and the philosophical questions he raises. Tru feels that he is helping people who should not die, and Jack feels that he is supposed to die, and is playing with the plan of destiny, or the plan of the universe, or something like that. <br /> <br /> But she is obviously capable of changing things, so obviously there is no such thing as destiny in the metaphysics of the series. Jack has no basis to believe there is. And very conveniently, Tru never asks the right questions. Nobody does it. Which obviously shows that the creators of the series do not have an answer. <br /> <br /> There's just no argument! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave it messy for the series to be able to continue with their boring girlish things, only interrupted occasionally by Tru and Jack competing with each other towards unknown extremes ... <br /> <br /> It turns out there's nothing like that. A series of pop for teenagers that pretends to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent sleeping.
