The robot against the Aztec mummy was one of the dumbest and least credible films I've ever seen. O.K, I can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin who was sacrificed to an Aztec god. What I can not buy is that the mummy looks incredibly fake and the robot looks even worse. When you want to watch a movie like this, you want to see a lot of fighting action. But the robot and the mummy fight for a minute in total! Probably the worst of all was the day of the dead they had in the credits. It's the worst I've seen in my life. Avoid this if possible.
