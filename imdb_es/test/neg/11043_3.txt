Oldboy settles in Korea and starts like a drunk Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is rescued from the police station by his friend only to be kidnapped, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room that will be prisoner for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed and cared for by his unknown captors, but he is never allowed to leave the room. Dae-su begins to train for revenge after he leaves, which he intends to do by removing the cement from the bricks with a toothpick. However, before Dae-su is finished, he is gassed and unconscious, when he wakes up, Dae- his is free on the roof of a high-rise building with all its funds. Dae-su begins to try to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the beautiful Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), the two fall in love and together with his help, Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth is in a price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production was co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and has received many enthusiastic reviews (of the type that distributors can choose and paste into the video box) and He even won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, while he was also nominated for the Golden Palm, so surely Oldboy is a true classic. Well, not for me, it is not, since I can not understand why he likes it so much and I would dare to say that I hated him very much, apart from one or two isolated moments. For starters, I could not get into the story, I just did not like it because I thought it was slow and boring, and while many of them made you believe that Oldboy has the best turn more shocking than ever, I thought it was quite simple and not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotized feels marked almost as if the manufacturers wanted some kind of happy ending. Almost two hours I almost fell asleep, I was so bored, the violence is docile and it is the idea of ​​what is happening that I imagine that most people have a problem instead of what it really shows. In fact, Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven and a soft sex scene, it's not really that graphic or memorable. I did not get excited about any of the characters and, although I accept, Oldboy has a concept and a premise that does not comply and it is a film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like it. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese manga of the same name Oldboy, the movie looks good, here are one or two good visual moments, although while everyone praises the fight in the hallway that takes place in a continuous shot, I was quite impressed and thought that the choreography of the fight was quite boring. . The actual violence on the screen amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live octopus that apparently is quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fighting scenes, a severed hand, some extracted teeth and some blood at the end. <br /> <br /> The budget supposedly was around $ 4,000,000, which is actually a bit fair, filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. The acting looks good, but it's hard to say that when the actors speak a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute task, I do not care about subtitled films or foreign films. paying attention to the plot while I followed it perfectly, but I did not like anything and it's as simple and direct as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's trilogy of revenge, which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005).
