I do not know what some of these filmmakers think about doing over and over again the same kind of clich√© movie, where the bad guys win (the bad girls in this case). Weak and very predictable performance. Nothing original in it. This same film has been done again and again, it is not different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other films with the same story and ending. There are many holes in the movie too. It is as if they had run out of money and simply stopped filming. Or maybe they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time with this. It will only leave you annoyed because you have wasted your time looking at it.
