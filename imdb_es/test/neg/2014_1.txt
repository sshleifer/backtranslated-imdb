Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" (cash in another bad vampire movie), as I saw, is a master class on how not to make a movie. A collection of rag labels from the misplaced salvage board a cargo ship previously lost "The Demeter" in the Carpathian System (cough) (which is later updated to the Carpathian Galaxy) and arouses a relentless evil (in this case, the script). The film is an extravagant bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the vaguest Vampire movie of all time is. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After a plethora of production company logos and a sequence of credits that most of the budget must have run out, we start with a cheesy Casper speech (silly name) who plays captain Abraham Van Helsing (silly name) and instead of the real development of the character, continues describing the twisted and unintelligible The oddities that make up his crew. Van Helsing himself sports a dew on the stubble and uses a body warmer in a kind of retro tribute from the 80s to Han Solo (I suppose). From time to time, the Captain of Demeter appears in a kind of crazy video diary to tell us nothing important in a pronounced German accent (the subtitles, unfortunately, are not included). The Mina crew approaches the abandoned ship (alone?) Armed only with a pistol-shaped torch and a thick accent of Eastern Europe while conversing with Van Helsing on the bridge of their ships (which is basically a single gleaming wall). Mina, who wears a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skater in a black cape that continuously slides through the camera. Why this happens because the vampire is not yet flesh is never explained This leads to an unstable camera that chases Mina through the corridors until he encounters Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith was recruited to write the Humvee lines, since most of them are that Humvee reminds us that he is black every ten seconds and says the word "ass" enough for an entry Guinness book of records while delivering all this in an "accent of the DA campaign" (this is the year 3000, is there even the "DA bell"?) One of the main problems of this film is that it tries to pretend that it is set in the year 3000. Unfortunately, anyone with healthy eyes will win. "Do not buy this, since the Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet-style tanker, possibly the film crew thought it would be nice to leave the symbols of the sickle and the hammer everywhere and an attractive poster of Lenin next to a lot of lockers and explain it as a kind of futuristic futuristic communist comeback.The crew's clothes look as if they had been looted from an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and are armed to the teeth with the latest automatic weapons of the twentieth century (with an additional year of 3000 zing to be fired), which, of course, are useless. Vampires Health is a thing of the past (in the future) since the teacher who simpering not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair. My God, what happened to all those genetic engineering things. <br /> <br /> The teacher is an interesting character, as it is a direct scam from Alien Resurrection, who had his own maladaptive crew with a boy in a wheelchair (who was strangely not killed). The fans did not approach the Prof since he seems scared in many scenes. If I were buried in a Soviet ship without access to a wheelchair chased by bad acting vampires, and they all left me because I was a plaintive scoundrel, I would be scared too. <br /> <br /> During the dramatic scene of Mina's persecution at the UN, the professor informs us (with feeling) "this is disconcerting". The rest of their lines are also disconcerting, "bugger", and "we're all going to die", X 100, below. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as the Vice Captain (what happened to the first officers?) in what I thought would be the tired, standard, hard nose, no nonsense, "do not look at me unless let me tell you too ", you hit 10 stuntman at the same time super-babe, but this is a Z-flick so, basically, it uses a tight-fitting low-cut top and even tighter-fitting leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is easier than a row of tents, but fortunately for us it dies soon enough. Even though it seems to keep your heart on the right side of your body. <br /> <br /> After running a lot along the same corridor, using Soviet-style controls and sitting in Soviet-style changing rooms, the crew finds themselves stranded while their own boats leave to find a more interesting crew (probably ). It is unknown why Dracula is mentioned, since the main villain is called Orlock, who is Space Transylvanian for "crimes against fashion", since he is wearing a big bloated shirt with an even bigger collar, which makes Hammer Horror vampires look skillful in comparison. Orlock stops to explain his full story (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but does not kill her in another Alien Resurrection spin. His story is so big that it's not worth repeating. As the budget can not afford the fight coordinators, the special effects, the original music, the script (not written by a chimp) and even the appropriate final titles (the first list of actors I saw, were the same characters but names completely different and Italian names), the movie begins. to destroy any sanity you started with. Fortunately, the crew can counterattack with the help of a ship computer that contains obscure, millenary references, on how to kill fictitious creatures and some twentieth-century billiard cues that are found in the ship's recreation room (up to the "holodeck" ). The end is horrible and a little suspicious, whether they ran out of money or the former soviets demanded their return. I entered this film knowing it was bad, but oblivious to how bad it really was.
