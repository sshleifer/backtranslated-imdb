I understand that Roger Corman loves to do things at a good price, but this is just sad. I bought this movie in the container of dollars in my local video store not a month after seeing the original Carnosaurus. I was amazed; It was the same damn movie, with just a little bit of Corbin Bernesen spliced! It reminded me of all those ninja movies of the '80s that took old Kung Fu movies and joined a bunch of white ninjas running around making car wheels with the word "ninja" written on their tapes (if you have not seen them, look "Ninja Terminator", "The Thunering Ninja", "Black Dragon" and "Ninja Warriors"). Thanks Roger Corman; You just made me lose a dollar.
