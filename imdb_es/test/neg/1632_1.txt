Why is not it other than Ator played hilariously bad by Miles O'Keefe? Surprisingly, I had the misfortune to sit on this turkey before Mystery Science Theater 3000 broke it into pieces. I highly recommend taking a look at the MST3K version, as it is hilarious and one of its best episodes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is basically the kind of typical B movie that Italian filmmakers were producing. From early to mid 80's. Apparently, this movie was made to take advantage of Conan's madness, but it failed miserably in all aspects. <br /> <br /> Watch for scenes in which Ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a full hang glider during a cut. <br /> <br /> "Thong, the fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> classification: the film itself-1 The MST3K version: 10
