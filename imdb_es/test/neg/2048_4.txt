I just saw this movie just for Sarah and I also give her these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Acting was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a movie that continued to contradict itself. The film was neglected and unoriginal. It's not like I'm waiting for a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. This did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think about the general plot, the less sense it has and the more holes we find. It's really a shame, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being a little hard giving the movie a 4/10 but given the actors involved and, again, the obvious talent of SARA, this movie really should have delivered much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is crap, I can not say it any other way. From the beginning, you know it's going to be crap. <br /> <br /> The story, the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the makeup, almost everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know that they will never be Oscar-winning movies, but this is not worth seeing, I can not believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... It does not exist, everything seems a great joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew what they tried to throw, but it was just counterproductive, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this). favors and DO NOT look at this. <br /> <br /> PS It's also full of clich√©s! PD 2 Bad script, bad direction, bad cinematography. PD 3 I bothered to comment on this as a favor for everyone.
