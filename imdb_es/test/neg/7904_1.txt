This "film" and I say it lightly, is nothing but pure garbage. I'm sorry for those people who really lost their money to go see this in theaters ... I saw a friend from a friend's movie and I've been regretting it ever since. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to have seen this. Furthermore, I am extremely horrified that people of other races have also seen this and may believe that it is a behavior of blacks in general. It's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, horribly vulgar vulgar jokes and tails of a discarded line by well-known African-American comedians who should have known better after reading this script. I should also mention the many rap and hip hop singers / rappers who populate the film as if it were too long a music video: they had absolutely no place in the film. I guess they were the "Jiving & Singing Jugglers?" HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The "writers", the producers and who had the stupidity to finance this "movie" should be filmed or locked in a room and forced to watch this crap without stopping for the rest of their lives. NO SEE !!! It is time lost from your life that you can never return.
