I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> Advantages: Absolutely none <br /> <br /> >> Cons: I I do not even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks and acts more like a live-action cartoon character. That's the whole plot that I got from this movie. <br /> <br /> Review: I remember when I was in ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown named Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when playing music, and it seems that the movie was recorded on a public access channel. Fortunately, I did not buy this movie like all my other degenerate comrades from the interior of the city. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My verdict: Avoid this video as your A sexually transmitted disease.
