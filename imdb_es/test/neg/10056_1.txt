Filmed in Arizona by a mostly foreign crew, "Nightkill" is one of the most awkward crime dramas I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (wearing a cowboy hat) tracks Jaclyn Smith, widow recently, hoping to find out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems as if someone has understood the American myth that all Westerners speak and dress as descendants of John Wayne! The script of Joan Andre and John Case could have worked better if it is considered a parody; This mystery thriller plays to tame, with director Ted Post asleep at the controls. Do not get caught by Jaclyn's video box screaming while you shower. She really takes a shower in this movie, but it is not revealing (nor does it promote the murky plot of iota). NO STARS OF ****
