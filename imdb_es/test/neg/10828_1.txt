Right ... then you have a dam, tons of water (which seems to flow very slowly) and a small town that is just below the path of destruction of the dams. Add a glutton of speculation, an apparently mentally unstable and unhappy architect and your child, and then, to spice things up, add a weak argument and a bad performance. In general, when you see this movie from the point of view of paying customers ... I would be extremely irritated if it were a pay-per-view movie. If you want to laugh ... then you really need to see this movie.
