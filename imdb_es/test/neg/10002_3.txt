Even the Beatles could not write songs that everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is not a fan, it is second to none when it comes to action movies that make you think. The nineties arrived and the social platforms were changing in music and cinema, the appearance of Rapper became a movie star in full swing, the performance was bypassed by the overwhelming regional accent of each man and transparent acting. This was one of the many Ice-T movies I saw as a child and I loved them, only to see them later and tremble. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives until a tenant in a building on fire, about to burn down, delivers a map with gold implications. I give it to Walter to quickly and neatly configure the main characters and the location. But I blame everyone involved for producing Lame-o performances. Ice-t and the cube must have been red-hot right now, and while I've enjoyed both their careers and rappers, in my opinion, they fell into this movie. It's about ninety minutes of a man turning his back on the other man ridiculously to the point where you find yourself locked into multiple states of disbelief. Now, this is a movie, it's not a documentary, so I will not waste my time counting all the stupid turns of the plot in this movie, but there were many, and they did not lead anywhere. I got the impression that everyone on the set was confused and could not do anything. There are two things I still enjoy, one involves a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's huge 45th gun. In conclusion, this movie is like domino pizza. Yes, I'll eat it if I'm hungry and I do not feel like cooking, but I know it tastes like shit. 3 stars, meh.
