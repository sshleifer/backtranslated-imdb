The splendid production values ​​that are usually found in a Merchant / Ivory movie are all here, but this is an extremely boring view of what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that there is no point in the story being developed through the eyes of an African-American family, and yet her own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has hardly a role to play in the process. You can not find much clarity in helping the public understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. And I was very upset by the accents of several of the characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British because what is supposed to be a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to try different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a way that we can never understand who she really is. At one point she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she is deploring the entire system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the role well enough, but it never makes us really care about Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing in general.
