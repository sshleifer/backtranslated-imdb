Based on how little I've seen of this program, I do not think I'll ever see it again. It is not remotely credible and, frankly, Derek's character just makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but seeing a spoiled brat make his way over and over again? Why would I want to see that? No, thanks, there are many other programs that involve tortuous characters (Phil of the Future's Pim, for example) where the evil one does not win or if they do not do it the way they do. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think this is a terrible image to paint about living with stepbrothers. Yes, life is not optimistic, but you could try to represent a character who was not completely bad and who wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you see this only if you like to see the villain win.
