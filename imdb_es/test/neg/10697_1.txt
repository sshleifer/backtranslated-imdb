This piece of shit is actually the PUMP, as in the bottom of the barrel. I can not find out what is the worst; Norris's boring description of anonymity (not a big trait in an action hero) or the hysterical hyperactivity of Christopher Neame. This film does not deliver at any level what ever. The action sequences are docile, the plot is very thin and the scenes that are supposed to be horrible seem a cliche of the fifties. You can not just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and wait for the audience to scream in terror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie does not do anything for me. Actually, it seems an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice con with a bit of hell spawn. No wait. That should have been a yawn from hell.
