An example of all the worst stereotypes of homosexuals in a movie. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why do you talk to that strange pseudo British / high accent, and insist that the child also speak like that? Did anyone else notice that all the music in the soundtrack is exactly the same? You must continue with the old and old things of the Hollywood camp in which you are so good! Die mommy dies II, the sequel !! I do not see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; There are so many stories of young real-life homosexuals to tell and that we should be seeing those, not this garbage. Sheesh, what a waste of time. Shameful example of gay cinema.
