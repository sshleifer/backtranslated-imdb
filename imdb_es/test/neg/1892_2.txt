I'm not demanding with the movies, oh, I've seen so much crap that I could see anything. Maybe that was the reason why I saw this until the end. I'm also a big fan of role-playing games, but this movie is a disgrace to any self-respecting RPG. The filming of a game's security camera would make it feel more realistic than this movie. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes, you can see that it was filmed in a photo when !!!!! I mean, would you continue your work if you had ninjas around you? Oh, and the jokes about pirates, which is the worst so far in the movies! At least the first one felt like a documentary, now it looks like someone's home video experiment. You can find better movies on youtube. Top line: Do not waste your time and money on this, it's as bad as it comes.
