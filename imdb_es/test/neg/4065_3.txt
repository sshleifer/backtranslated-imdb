I have seen three other films that are worse than this, "Plan 9 from Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the feared "Blair Witch Project". There are so many technical errors in this film that, regardless of a decent plot, the film alone is not credible. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between cars. The killer walks behind his victim when she moves from one car to another and pushes her off the train. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a murderer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He uploads his stereo! If I listened to my stereo suddenly become stronger would worry me. He kills women by throwing an electric curler in the bathtub. I was surprised to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cable could pull ten feet and stay plugged in. In addition, the apartment seemed modern enough to have plugs in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the best-known commercial aircraft on the planet, so this part really surprised me. First, the cabin was not even close to a real 747 and, second, it was not on the top deck of the plane. I watched in amazement as the pilot and copilot (Where was the flight engineer?) Passed through the spiral staircase and headed for the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised that the bullets would not penetrate an aluminum trolley (something good for our hero) or on the bathroom doors, but would penetrate the roof causing a fuel leak that came out through a small hole in the fuselage. Eh Seeing three men lengthen a track by 100 yards in less than a week was also quite surprising. <br /> <br /> I did not check it, was this a movie of the week or something like that? It was terrible.
