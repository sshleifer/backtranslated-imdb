There is potential there with "Tell anyone". A curious and intriguing plot, and a Frenchman assumes a very American story. But for me, the opportunities were not exercised here. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some aspects of this film, there were three major flaws that took it to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a silly murder mystery and clich√©. A specially devised murder that she wrote or Bergerac. Being French does not eliminate this problem, it is nonsense and, at the same time, in French. It is full of implausible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from the United States to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor walks through the "streets" of a French city with his new "homies" and his Blingin 'SUVs ... and then there is the car chase ... <br /> <br /> But in third place and above all, it is too long For me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly more than 90 minutes, and more than two hours requires a serious justification. This once I did not have it.
