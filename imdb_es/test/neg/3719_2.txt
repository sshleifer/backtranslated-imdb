If this movie becomes a Christmas tradition, I'll have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you think about comparing this with 'A Wonderful Life'! It was absolutely horrible! The child's song caused my fingers to bend. And what the hell was the deal with her hair? Emmy worthy performance ?! Please. Of course, Lucci did it well, but an Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they were so close to the original story that he intended to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. He lacked enthusiasm and persistence in all aspects. Lighting, costumes, makeup, it seemed that everyone wanted to go home. Just a big NO from me.
