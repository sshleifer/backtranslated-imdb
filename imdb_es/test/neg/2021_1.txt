I'm at a loss for words This movie is beyond description. I do not think there is a language on Earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is. If you try to see it, be sure to stay for the "end of the surprise". I only managed to get three-quarters of this shit before I could not take it anymore. Fortunately (or unfortunately) some of my friends stayed until the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy they were able to inform me of what they had lost. This movie has no history, no plot, no horrible writing, and even worse acting. If you like to see trains or car accidents, this movie is for you. I think my IQ was reduced by around 30 points by seeing this (insert expletive here).
