There is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting, except humans. It's pretty good, and it's been made and remade in movies and television many times. Some are remarkable, but this urbanized version, which injects the old themes of racism, simply sucks. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the script without grace. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can not stop dancing gracefully, I mean it's funny in a pathetic way, but it's not enough to take a movie. You have the usual Nazi or neo-Nazi vestige, whatever it is that we are supposed to think about, a villain whose son, of course, is gay, German accents ... do you take the picture?
