This movie was so bad that I do not know where to start, apparently neither did the filmmakers. Start with a guy in his mid-thirties and until the end of the forties watching television. The news speaks of a corn maze that is open for Halloween. He has a "vision" that God knows what and rushes to save his children who are walking in a maze of a field of corn and are somehow linked to this "vision". How do you ask? I do not know, and as I said before, neither did the filmmakers. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did you get these "visions"? It is never explained, we are supposed to follow it. Enter the labyrinth to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he seeks pass in front of him, once they actually run into him. What does he do? Does he chase them? No. He stays there like an idiot who calls them when they run by. Do the girls stop? No. They run away and then ask: "Was that dad?" Then, someone dressed as a demon jumps on the "star" (dad's character) hits him in a pathetic fight only to discover that he is a worker in the enchanted labyrinth. The police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a very bad term to use) they handcuff him. They handcuff his hands in front of him, so he can find something with which he can open the lock, what he does. First of all, anyone who has been arrested knows that the police handcuff you with their hands behind their backs, and secondly, why does this "average man" seem to know how to open the lock on the handcuffs? Well, it finally escapes the cops who give up and leave after the "star"'s wife shoots the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way, it is already night and all the workers who walk through the labyrinth seem to have left once the sun sets. Leaving a man who attacked one of his workers and two missing children in the labyrinth. Considering it was a slow night that these are your only customers, why not? Also the cops apparently have better things to do as well. By the way, the "star" that bears the name of "Walker", we discover that it is his surname, a name with which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows that there is something buried in the middle of this maze of the cornfield and begins to dig. I say "somehow" because I could not understand why he started digging in the first place. Find a medallion, what does it mean? Nothing for who sees it, but for him it's a kind of crime trail. Someone killed their children in their "vision" and I think that's what they're doing, a real job as a detective. And now he knows there's a killer in the corn maze, one who somehow knew he was there from the beginning of the movie, so he's looking for his girls. Every time we see the murderer, or rather at the killer's feet, we hear a strange robotic sound, like a sci-fi rejection toy that changes a person's voice to a mechanical sound. Why do we hear this sound? Is it related in any way to ... something? Once again, who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The maximum point of all the bad performance and the bad dialogue was when "Walker" shouts "Hey, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll catch you". Again, his wife is attacked by the "Bad Man" at the entrance of the corn maze, which, as I mentioned earlier, is strangely empty of employees or policemen. The "bad man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans to murder his wife, his children and also him. "Walker" can only respond with "Hey, HEY!" Before dropping his phone and running away. With no one to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, drags the wife a few feet and then leaves her alone for the rest of the movie, missing the first chance to stay true to her whims. If this writing was not written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps was not. It was written, directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he also did a lot of the shit camera work, where we got random foot shots through the muddy labyrinth and meaningless takes of the corn field, which waste 90% of the movie's time. In the end, "Walker" uses his fists to handcuff the "Bad Man", who also seems to know how to force locks with the same metal object with which "Walker" had done it. Apparently there are many small metal objects around this cornfield. But after the killer insists that he is still going to kill the children, "Walker" kills the "bad man", and everything goes well with the world. Now in reality this makes "Walker" a murderer, he killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his own. He knows it, not by tests, but by his visions. He never found a body, nobody else knows that this guy was in the labyrinth. And the medallion? He returns it to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No test. Then he kills a man without any tangible reason. I can not imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this. It must have been a way to cover up an embezzlement of funds for the production company. I'd rather see the Blair Witch Project five times than see this movie again. The actors should be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman must also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If there is someone associated with this movie, respond. What were you thinking?
