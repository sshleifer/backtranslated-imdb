** SPOILERS ** With the title of the film that has the name of the killer fish twice, not once, one would expect to see them in action, attacking, biting and devouring almost everyone in the cast of characters. Instead, you have to wait until the movie is almost finished so you can see as much as the Piranahs. Even then all you see is the water bubbling and churning as a poor individual disappears beneath it, assuming the fish is eating it whole and alive. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with this Piranha looking scary on the screen as the credits begin to go down, but **** SPOILER **** is the only time in the movie You see the killer fish or fish that you can never see Piranha. It is the movie. again. What he does see is a travel notebook of Venezuela and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin. Along with many beautiful and impressive photographs of the landscape, as well as people and wildlife, but that's it. <br /> <br /> There is a story that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribbean, William Smith, which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the film really means? "Piraña Piraña"? "Caribbean Caribbean"! The Caribbean person is played by the legendary Hollywood motorcyclist Hell's Angles and the aggressive William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown and Ahna Capri, and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are heading to the Venezuelan jungles to make tourism with Terry taking pictures to send them home. Terry is terrified of guns when we learn that when a girl saw her father blow his head off with a gun. Even when Art saves his life with one, when See's attack by a six-foot-long diamond rattlesnake, Terry almost tied him up for having a gun; which promised he would not take him with him on the trip. <br /> <br /> At a jungle stop, or in a bar, the three run to the Caribbean, which we saw for the first time catching monkeys in the jungle. of the movie. The Caribbean is made most welcome by all three with their knowledge of the jungle and their half-hearted philosophy about life and death, as well as their ability to take them where they go to local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin . <Br /> <br /> Despite being a bit strange at first, the guy is so interested in himself that he does not seem to notice that there are people around him, Caribbean turns out to be a nice and nice guy who participates in A long AND friendly motorcycle race through the marshes and the jungle with art. The Caribbean even shows Terry, who at one point in the movie almost pulled his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and wild shooting that he believes do not die but become part of him after he kills them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It's much later in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe it was the cheap drink I was drinking, Caribbean suddenly goes crazy and becomes a homicide by attacking and raping Terry and then murdering his enraged brother and feeding him the one of the deadly piranhas. Trying to escape from the crazy lunatic and then being forced to have to fight him, Art. He is beaten so savagely by the dirty fighting Caribbean that it almost knocks him out. Just when the Caribbean is about to kill Art, he is killed by Terry, who, after having experienced what this crazy madness is about, finally decided that weapons are very necessary and should be used to kill very rarely, but to save lives. <Br /> <br /> It's worth seeing them, if it's worth seeing them, just for the scenery and nothing else. It's a shame that the movie has to be announced as a killer fish, or Piranha, a horror movie when, if it were honest, it could have been an adventure movie in the jungle more or less normal with Smith, he has the ability to do it . Playing Tarzan from the Venezuelan jungle, not African.
