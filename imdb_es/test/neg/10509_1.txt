Actually, this movie almost makes me cry. <br /> <br /> To begin with, false teeth. Then you see a nice plastic or a drawn set. To make it even more boring, all the action is followed by a flash of bright light. Then, speaking: the sound levels are so different, sometimes too difficult, too soft, never as good as in good movies. Also, it gets so much echo that I think they had a microphone in the whole set. And to make matters worse, have you ever heard of stereo? If the camera changes, the sound always remains centered. The actors speak as if they were reading from a board mounted behind the camera. And zoom in another scene, how terrible childish. <br /> <br /> Music is so badly chosen that it never adds anything. It only destroys any accidentally created emotion. <br /> <br /> To finish, the fight scenes ... my 3-year-old niece would make a better fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is It's not even good to laugh, it's so bad ...
