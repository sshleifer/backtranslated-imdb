I bought this for a couple of dollars at the local video store, as they erased their tapes in favor of the DVDs. I doubt they will replace this, in any way. <br /> <br /> I could not say it's one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's very boring. There are no scenes of real cannibals. Me Me Lai is not naked enough (only about 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I expected either. So two of my reasons for watching this movie were eliminated. <br /> <br /> Here is a bit of severe animal violence for those who enjoy that kind of thing. A great fight between a mongoose and a large snake becomes quite bloody. The torture of animals, too, some of which are real and others false. Fortunately, the fake is fun, but the real is a bit disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a movie from the 70s, too long, too little developed, not as deep as you would have liked. . But it's something different, right? ONE AND A HALF STAR!
