Impressive imitation of Star Wars with a slightly more comical tinge. Robert Urich plays the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all poor people are still alive is a mystery). It hooks up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 years old and a total cutie), a princess in search of her missing father. Also in the cast is Anjelica Huston, who looks embarrassed, with some hilarious science fiction groups and a short, corpulent Ron Perlman (who he thought was seven feet tall from his other papers!). And John Carradine, who is looking for days since death and Hollywood comedian Squares (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch be decapitated, here's your movie. But, again, even that is not worth seeing, since it does not shut him up at all (I think it could have been a robot, but I fell asleep a couple of times).
