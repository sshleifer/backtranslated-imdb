This movie was a low point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. The main points of the plot are taken directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (launched two years earlier and also with Robards): a man finds a watering hole in the desert, being the only water in many miles in all directions, plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to make sure there is a love interest, falls in love with a prostitute. To this is added an intemperate preacher, bad music, silly fast action shots, even silly T & A shots, and that's it. There's no question why it failed at the box office. The real question is "how did you get that far?"
