This turned out well and it looks interesting. However, as it progresses, the attempts to create emotions between the characters are so inept that they really quell the horror and are an insult to serious viewers. The story on which "I walked with a zombie" is probably much better, although unfortunately I have not seen it yet. "Ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it has been very poor, which is a shame. It's hard to say what is wrong with that. I guess there are too many inept scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, in the love story between Alice (Alice Dodgson is called as the girl who supposedly inspired Lewis Carrol to call her heroine Alice) and the younger brother. Absolutely nothing has been built between them and in the end they get married. Anyway, it looks very good and it's worth taking a look, but the movie is very misunderstood. 3/10.
