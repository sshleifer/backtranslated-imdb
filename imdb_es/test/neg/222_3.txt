Today I went to see this movie, with the hope that it involved at least half a smart story. I was extremely disappointed, since he did not. The plot, and the decisions of the main character, were so implausible. I expected a movie like "Dog Day in the afternoon", but instead I got something totally unacceptable. In fact, I found myself totally expecting the "hero" to be defeated, and I almost left the theater several times when it should have happened, but it was not like that. Theft movies are not movies to feel good, and this tried to be just that. Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie, I found myself saying "no way". Without revealing the whole story, it revolved around an armored car guard who had financial problems and whose house was in the process of foreclosure. He was invited to a robbery and accepted, only to back down once the action began. Weak.
