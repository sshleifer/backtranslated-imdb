Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro must be a combination that results in a great comedy. Great expectation often leads to disappointment, and this proves to be the case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy, as a police officer, ruins a drug trafficking business on the part of Detective Robert, he is criticized so much that they end up doing a live reality TV show. Logic is not a big component of this movie. The super gun that spend the second half of the movie chasing confirms it. A twelve-gauge machine gun that leaves large holes in the metal sheet and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without recharging) is more of a fantasy than science fiction. A five-pound gun, which fires hundreds of shots per minute without recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie was not designed for adults or children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.
