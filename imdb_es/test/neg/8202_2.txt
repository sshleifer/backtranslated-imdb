A non-epic Roger Corman from 1957 in which several characters end up in a valley lined with lead (sic) right when the stock images are unleashed. Is it the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (a single virgin, a Las Vegas gif who drinks and smokes, guess which one is at the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the forest eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust has made "a million years of evolution" (in a human being already alive) the result is a ridiculously bad rubber monster, with a zipper on its back, that has a strange fear of its only source of water sweet. Rains. The monster dissolves. The two remaining characters, the Hunk and the Virgin. He set out to repopulate the world while the legend 'The Beginning' filled the screen after it happened that the brief rain had washed away all the radioactivity and dissolved all the monsters that ran 'outside'. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really shows about this is the incredible amount of "curtain action" that occurs in it. One of the basic elements of the making of bad and economical films of the time was the superabundant use of the curtains in the design of the stage. It was cheap. Finished with a configuration? Pass a curtain, place a different piece of furniture in front of you and you will have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting. <br /> <br /> 'Acting curtain' is a skill in which the actor can comment on what is happening outside of any building he is in ("It looks like Rain", or "Here they come now, and it seems they have the sheriff with them! ", that kind of thing). He will stand on one side of the window, extending over his body and lifting the curtain to move it away from the window, but along the axis of the shot, that is, towards the camera, which allows him to pretend that he is looking outwards. and it tells us what happens outside the screen, without letting the audience see that they are looking at the studio wall three inches away from their nose behind cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of that in this movie.
