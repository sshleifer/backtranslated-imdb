In the last years of the reign of Ron Miller (the son-in-law of Walt Disney cum Producer) he reigned on a stick often starring the very bored Dean Jones, whose career was based on that kind of light, empty-headed fare. Other horrible films from that same period include Pete's Dragon, Noah's Last Flight of the Ark, Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I will not mention Tron because I thought it was ambitious and Miller was just the executive producer, so it had little to do with real production. However, it was in full force when this dreadful piece of human garbage was expelled from the bowels of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to the beloved Love Bug story finds Herbie in love with another car that also has a brain and heart. There's a race, some bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. Filmed in France, the film is actually very well photographed and the course is charming. But one has the idea that the film was made so that everyone involved could have a three-month vacation in France. The rest of the movie is a disaster. Prat Falls, clumsy thieves, evil German racing competitors and a feminist who bounces quite fall into the category of stock supply. The film's biggest insult: trying to further develop Herbie's loving personality through jolts, beeps, flashing lights and indicative movements of a seventeen-year-old horny, Disney writers commit an injustice with our little VW. Then, once again, I think it would be hard for anyone to get past Helen Hayes by driving Herbie around a skyscraper ledge on the second exit.
