I'm very open minded. I see all kinds of programs until the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn from the good and bad aspects. This show had the potential to be good. But my God, what did the writers, the casting director and the director think? The cast of actors is terrible ... with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) who receive good occasional lines with the best execution of the lot. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast kills the show. It is the same line of history in each episode. Sam has plans to do something. Your boss interrupts these plans by assigning you ridiculous work projects. Then, the silly ways in which Sam tries to accommodate both of them in a way that is mainly stupid and lacks a really intelligent mood. This is EVERY episode. It becomes very exhausting. <br /> <br /> Season 2, get rid of the eyes. The 2 "hot" girls in the program are written (even so, the brother stays?) Explain the casting that you did to me please. I can see why they wrote them ... they did not have a substantial role ... but they did not add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> The character of Derek Tricolli is given a continuous appearance in season 2. His performance (along with that of everyone else) resembles many bad comedies of the 80s ... it could have been fun then ... but now painful. <br /> <br /> The show could have been much better with some good writers and some people who had some talent to execute them. This show lacks everything. The quality of production is the only good aspect of the show. It's great in that sense ... unfortunately the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My God. FOX, is there really nothing better to choose from? I stay with programs like "Always sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be established by programs like these that really assume that the audience is intelligent and are not drooling continuously on themselves using all their mental power to keep breathing.
