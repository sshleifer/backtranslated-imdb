I read many hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. Having not read the book, I do not know if this adaptation was true, but I do know that it was not good. Actually, the script was the best part of the movie, so congratulations to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and looked at Carolina Moon by Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She has been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, Forlani was not alone. The performances were all over the place. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was hammy. Then, in the midst of all this B-rate performance, there's Jacqueline Bisset! She did not have much to do other than portray the bitterness, but, even asleep for that, she was way ahead of the others. <br /> <br /> However, Forlani is still one of the most impressive women in the movies and me. I was not disappointed with that ability here. I think Forlani can be more than a candy, but until he gets a good performance in a good movie, he continues to excel in that. And I will continue to faithfully observe all that she participates. Fandom is fun that way. <br /> <br /> However, this movie, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad. In addition to the bad performance (the false accents of the south really distract) the direction was pedestrian. It was not horrible. It was just the boring caliber made for television that you used to watch on Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of any of the stars, you can probably enjoy Carolina Moon for that reason, like I do. If you are a fan of the book, you may enjoy watching the story on the screen, albeit in a tarnished way. Otherwise, this movie is nothing special.
