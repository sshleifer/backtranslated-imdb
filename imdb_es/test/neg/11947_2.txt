What a bad idea it was to remake a film almost worthy of an Oscar! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, she has depth, delicacy, etc., mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the main role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness for the handsome Aaron and the whole environment ... again, a ridiculous Hollywood effort. There is more and more remake and the movies are full of schemes. Is not there anyone there who can create a good new script? Or is it a security solution to make a new version or movies from well-proven cartoon characters? Movies are becoming much less interesting nowadays. Ah, yes: if you want to see a movie REALLY good, look at the original. Definitely worth it.
