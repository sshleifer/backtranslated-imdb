Yes, this movie is obviously trying to be a Conan the Barbarian, and what surprises me is that this is a sequel (did the people demand another one?). The first part of the movie is a flashback that shows the original. From what I saw, it does not seem worth looking at it (and, apparently, Ator always kills a great puppet in his films). Well, now Ator lives in the confines of the earth with his mute companion, Tanga. A girl seeks your help because this evil guy has his father in his custody. Let me say that this bad guy is extremely patient, since the old man constantly insults the villain and only talks non-stop. The bad boy waits until the end of the movie and, finally, hits the old man and leaves you wondering "What took so long to break?". Meanwhile, Ator and his partner and the girl go through one adventure after another. They fight against cavemen, invisible soldiers (do not ask), rent out thugs and people who worship snakes. Ator also fights a giant snake puppet and delta wings (again, do not ask). All the time you'll think Conan would kick Ator's ass.
