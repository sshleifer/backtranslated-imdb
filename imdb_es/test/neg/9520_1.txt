What a self-indulgent disorder! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however, it is impossible to find a glimpse of emotional truth in this chaotic, ill-acted and unfortunately amateurish fiasco. <br /> <br /> In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall, from a child of the working class and mistreated even a criminal English lord. However, the tone is so self-pitying or so arched, that it is impossible to interact with the characters or the plot. The raw material is potentially a great thing, however, Roy seems unable to unravel the kind of story that should get you down the throat and then make you cry. And it is a complete mystery why it was created to be projected as a triptych of images, probably because a single image would have been too tedious to see it. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many good actors. - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - giving the worst performances of his career.
