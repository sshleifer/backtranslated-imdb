Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality of Food Network and of all television. If you've never seen 30-minute meals, then you may not be able to begin to understand how uncomfortably upset she is. I really meant that you can not even be surprised by it until you see the program once or twice, and even then all the intelligent words and thoughts will fail you. The problem is mainly with your gestures, as you may have guessed. Ray has a silly mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you love something or think it is "incredible" (a word that uses approximately 87 times per transmission) just say it. And she constantly uses amusing and funny phrases like "AOVE" (Extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT! What's worse is that Ray has TWO other programs on the network. I think this is a complicated conspiracy by terrorists to drive us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
