When the American film industry tries to critically analyze its own government, they make sure it looks good, even when it's bad. <br /> <br /> The film does one thing well and perfectly demonstrates what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be fuck with whoever it takes to do things! Mix a US congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to fuck the Ruskies. Thanks to the United States for giving us Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of the film is due to a mess of problems: using images of unarmed Afghan children and stories of Soviet atrocities and then creating a blatant attempt to suggest a link between those and the reasoning behind the American help. Every sensible person knows why the $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... not the case of dying Afghan children, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, serious topics are dealt with on the facade of the nonsense dialogue. "Here it is, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam sings in the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military solutes. The films can not help but leave the aftertaste to the feeling of American pride and rejoicing at how we (the Americans) have saved the world ... once again. Not even the last 5 minutes of the movie can save him, since he is making an attempt to stop praising himself and wake up to the fact that he is just another American F ** k up. <br /> <br /> The acting and editing was good though.
