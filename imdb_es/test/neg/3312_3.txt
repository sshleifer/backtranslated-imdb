IN AGREEMENT. Well, I guess it was worth it to dedicate myself to this * once *, but I will not see it again. There are several things about this movie that irritated me. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I really hated the characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I find it difficult to rationalize spending a good amount of time following characters that I do not really care about and with whom I can not relate. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; It was that the characters were written in such a way that I simply despised them, and as the movie progressed, I almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. And this brings me to the second problem, and a question that I think is at the heart of this film: the intention was simply to document this generation and these types of bohemians who were (I suppose) wandering around Europe in the 60s? The intention was to criticize and punish them? Or was this movie a kind of warning? My final evaluation of the film (that is, in determining if there was anything that can be saved here) depends on this question. <br /> <br /> Despite that, these characters are really unpleasant, and as a consequence, it's hard to really give a shit about the plot or what happens to them. If this was some kind of statement about this generation, then the movie becomes a bit more tolerable. It is clear that Schroeder is not a kind of geriatric square, so the way it comes here has more weight than, for example, the innumerable and stupid AIP films set in or in relation to the counterculture of the 60s. < br /> <br /> At least, this film has two things in its favor: first, the soundtrack (obviously). I like how Cymbaline is used here and others have also mentioned it, as it takes the lead in the movie. I suppose if you are a Pink Floyd fan and want to see it for that reason, it is likely that nothing you read here prevents you from seeing it (it would not stop me either). The curiosity of listening to Pink Floyd in a movie can be enough to overcome this. <br /> <br /> Second, there are some nice landscapes. Ibiza seems like a good place to visit. Maybe I'm just sick of seeing Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in movies, but European films that take the time to show us really Europe (the beautiful or the ugly, mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really do not see any particular genius here. No revolutionary camera work, not even a moral, tone, message, sensitivity or plot that has something new to say. Perhaps the revolutionary thing about this was simply that it came from a guy like Schroeder, a film that criticizes a mindset that at least in part made his films commercial. In that sense it's an honest movie; here there is no glorification of the abject excesses of the 60s, which may be something one might expect. In fact, the representation of the characters in this film reflects closely the modern cultural memory (something distorted, in my opinion) of that generation. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, a lot of nudity (and yawning) and sex here; Nothing new if you see this kind of movies from this period of time. I guess it was considered novel or provocative or something like that at the time. I do not find it offensive or exciting (I doubt you do too); rather, it only extends the execution time of a movie that is already tedious. In its own way, this particular use of sexuality in the films of the time (especially European ones) has become a clich√©. But I suppose in retrospect you can not blame them; Only in that decade could they "get away with it" and I suppose (I suppose here) that the presence of this type of graphic sexuality was a political or social assertion in itself (since sexuality was a part of life from which this generation would not be as rare as their parents were). <br /> <br /> Should you see it? If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, sure ... I think it's worth seeing. In any case, The Valley is a better movie. I went into this movie, waiting in large part for what I got. If you do not normally see this type of artistic and avant-garde films and you do not know what to expect, this is likely to be very annoying. This is a normal and healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of Pink Floyd, I am not sure why you would spend your time here. I noticed that a colleague who left a comment really enjoyed this movie, so maybe I'm missing something. I do not need the guys to run in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions or something like that to enjoy a movie. But I do need some kind of control: I need to find something that I like about a movie, and in general I need to sympathize with some aspect of the difficult situation of the characters (unless some new movie works, go ahead). Here, there is simply nothing to cling to, except the magnificence of Pink Floyd. Which is * enough * to make this tolerable. At a minimum, if you're a Pink Floyd fan to start, you'll like the part with Cymbaline, I promise.
