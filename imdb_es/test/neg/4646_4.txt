Well, first I read the book and I thought: wow, it would be great to see it in a movie, what I started looking for and I discovered that I had already made a movie ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and they saw it ... They did terribly wrong! At first, this child Hapi, who is not a character in the book, then the mixture between the two books ("the god of the river" and "the seventh scroll") that Nicholas needs funds, while in the book he himself is in the founder, everything related to the Hyksos is also wrong ... Taila is supposed to have invented the light car ... everything related to the grave is also very bad ... there is supposed to be a channel that has some type of emptiness. suction around him ... the grave itself was made in a labyrinth with only one possibility of passing if one knows the rules of the ancient game of boas. There was nothing in the movie that Nicolas was English and Royan was a Coptic-Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were only a few good things about the film, the actors who played Royan, Nahood. , Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, he did not even approach the character that was in my head while writing the book ... It's a pity that a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith gave his permission for this ...
