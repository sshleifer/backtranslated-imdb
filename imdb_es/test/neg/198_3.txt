When, once, a friend criticized me for my first movie (a badly recorded subject on video), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first film, in fact, was even worse. He challenged me that I could not be, so I took out the Criterion Laserdisc from (I think) KANE CITIZEN and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted only a few minutes before conceding the point. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of humor in this short, but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegial response to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant The best movies of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and, unless you really enjoy a recording of Welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this is not worth tracing.
