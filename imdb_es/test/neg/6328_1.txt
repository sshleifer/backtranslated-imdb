I caught this movie on the night television. Honestly, I saw most of the time, and all the time I was sitting in complete and absolute disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there any genre that is more useless than soft-core porn? If there is, I do not want to know. Soft porn combines all the horrors of pornography (lousy production values, abominable performances, shitty scripts) with the shyness of sex scenes in normal movies. So the end result is exciting or entertaining. This movie also has the rather strange approach to a science fiction environment, and it works horribly. All sex takes place in a virtual reality environment where the crew of the future learns about physical love. And yes, it is as confused and silly as it seems. <br /> <br /> But there have to be some positive points, right? Well, there's one ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. That's the only thing that was less than horrible in this movie. I do not know what it is, but it has incredible sexual appeal. However, the rest of the cast resembles standard porn. More unattractive women with fake bad breasts and men who have spent too much time in the gym tonifying themselves grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany also judging by the haircuts and the clothes. <br /> <br /> To summarize things. If you enjoy the presence of Krista Allens on the screen, you can see this in the brief moments in which she shows some of her seductive potential (although most of the time she tries to articulate poor quality lines of dialogue). If you do not enjoy Krista Allen, then you should walk away completely. <br /> <br /> I qualify this 10/10 for the sexual attractiveness of Krista Allens, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a unique hybrid of pornography / science fiction that does not It's like nothing I've ever seen.
