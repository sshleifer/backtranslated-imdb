You know, after the first Chuck Norris movies, I realized that Golan-Globus produced a movie, even if I tuned into the medium, without looking at the credits or the title. What's more, I could say it was Golan-Globus within a minute of screen time. Something about the structure of the story, the silly relationships between the characters, the mannered dialogue, the wooden performance (enriched by the occasional and terrible interpretation), the tempos and rhythms of the scene that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan , the fine plots like paper. Choreography of struggle not prepared for the best moment ... Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in terms of style, subject and point of view. <br /> <br /> What can you say? You must work for them, as they have literally produced dozens of movies. You go to one of your productions and you know exactly what you are receiving. And it's not a brain food, folks. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of piracy in a long line of products from the GG sausage factory, and offers the typical pleasures limited to movie goers. 'palate. You have a bad ninja, cutting police and criminals and anyone else who gets in his way. You have a good ninja, he promised to stop him. You have a Westerner in the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be assured that "we can still beat those annoying Orientals at their own game." You have a Love Interest (which is usually also the worst actor / actor in the movie) fencing with the Hero. You have your endless series of assaults, assassinations and prolonged shots of men agitating in agony while an arrow or a star throws jumps out of your eye, neck or chest unconvincingly. You have your White Meatman / Bodyguard Man in Suits calling a Ninja a 'Son of A B * tch' and throwing a round blow, only to be given his own. You have a final confrontation between the good boy and the bad boy that lasts 20 minutes and stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a bit different, in the sense that the plot revolves around a scant athletic woman who is possessed by the Bad Ninja, which ends up killing many policemen and criminals and Guards of Beefy White's body in suits while under his spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in form as a Kabuki play or a Noh drama. <br /> <br /> Actually I thought Lucinda Dickey was quite nice in this movie. She is very muscular and curvy, has great cheekbones and a bit of athletic 'ooomph' in her movements, and you can really suspend the belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the deeds she does in the movie. She can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. An additional start for your participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Sho Kusugi is here, and practically dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And just to show you what the third-rate and uninspired GG films are like, the director and the editor inter-cut the last climatic fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of Dickey and his boyfriend watching the battle of life and death with an expression of slight bewilderment. Seriously speaking ... for all the excitement and reaction they show to the process, they might be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey felt when he saw the finished product: he probably wanted to run the editor with a real katana because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you are a fan of Sho Kusugi, or even a fan of Linda Dickey, it would be worth it.
