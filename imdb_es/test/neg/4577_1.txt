I had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently. I had the great misfortune of having played it also on my RETURN flight. Obviously, Demi's attempt to obtain some "artistic" credit, the film is a disaster due to its poor acting ability. A better actress could have done this work, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the inner emptiness. At least it is not ruining American literature this time.
