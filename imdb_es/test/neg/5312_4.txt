I'm a Get Shorty fan. This is the sequel to the movie that did not need a sequel. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo has left without taking a look. Unfortunately, the Chili game was played in the first film and, instead of finding an interesting personal arc for him, they have it stopped repeating the lines of the first movie. It is quite warm. Travolta seems old here. It's as if they moved the people around them because their bones creak. Its pink lip gloss and blue contacts are very rare. The second bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that only requires her to be the Reuben Kincaid woman. ("Hey, these kids have a great new sound"). In any scene she hits the wrong tone motivationally or emotionally or both. It is painful to see it. Despite its many problems, Be Cool is improved after an unpromising start. <br /> <br /> I certainly managed to laugh (Vince Vaughan running on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, at (a shirt that says "widow" on it), but it does not offer great memories when it's over. a helio-light love party from the first picture, there's no one as idiotically invaluable as Gene Hackman in the first film, it's about doing good in the world, for a couple of children who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock) Ho-hum The first was not to preach. <br /> <br /> Working on (repeatedly) gags and lines of the first movie is annoying, as is the silent concession to fight fans Free of Rock (he raises his eyebrow twice) as internal jokes are: Steven Tyler says: "I'm not the kind of singer that appears in movies." Ar /. <br /> <br /> The spectacular alignment of stars It's part of the problem, the first movie was not loaded by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a rental of money, let's face it even.
