This is an example of why most action movies are the same. Generic and boring, there really is nothing worth seeing here. A complete waste of the talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, that were hardly exploited, and that have shown many times that they are capable of acting and acting well. Do not bother with this, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or look at New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. The horribly clich√©d dialogue of Ice-T only makes this movie tear, and I still wonder what the hell Bill Paxton was doing in this movie. And why the devil does the same character always play? From Aliens onwards, every movie I've seen with Bill Paxton makes him play the same annoying character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it something rewarding ... <br /> <br /> In general, This is second-class trash of action. There are countless better movies to watch, and if you really want to see this one, look at Judgment Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made it worthwhile to see all this was a decent hand in the camera: the cinematography was almost refreshing, which is close to compensating for the horrible movie itself, but not quite. 4/10.
