The idea of ​​taking Dracula to contemporary times is not bad: after all, he could revive the series a bit by injecting a new element of history into a series that Hammer has exhausted in a long series of generally excellent films. However, because today turned out to be the early 70s, the results were pretty dumb and more like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie replete with 70's hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music seemed stupid. To make things worse, the performance is much more exaggerated here, with an intense and silly performance of "Johnny Alucard". I also thought it was really funny that Van Helsing's grandson realized that "Alucard" is "Dracula" spelled backwards. Nobody else discovered it for himself! Wow, what a cunning! <br /> <br /> So, because a lot of the movie was bad, why did it win an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. Also, and I know this will sound very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, at least Stephanie Beacham's character wore some really nice outfits that revealed a lot ... "talents", so to speak. So at least it was a pretty movie to watch. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film ends with the phrase "rest in peace FINAL" at the end, although this was not the last film by Hammer Dracula with Lee. He returned for "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" shortly after and was, in many ways, even worse than this monster movie.
