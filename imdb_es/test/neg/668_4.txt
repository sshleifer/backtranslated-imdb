Okay, let's be realistic about this. Nobody enters a film produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former director of pornography (the man gave the world the trilogy Between the cheeks), starring a fighter called Kane, and wait a bit. Slice of art on a gold tray. If so, you probably have to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. <br /> <br /> So, what exactly can we expect from a movie like this? Well, this is what I expected: <br /> <br /> 1) bad performance. 2) A fairly non-existent argument, clich√©. 3) Kane walking with a wrinkled and sour face that indicates that his nostrils found the potato salad he had lost a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're hungry for entertainment "so bad that it's fun", this could satisfy your appetite because it meets all the requirements. <br /> <br /> Obviously, movies like this one look better for free, but if you choose to sacrifice the dollars at the box office, have fun and make a game. The filmmakers are kind enough to introduce each of the annoying criminals by showing their names and legal crimes on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write which ones you want to see dead and in what order. You and your friends can see what are the most accurate predictions. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your friends write every moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tell them at the end and see who else comes up with them. I think my total was 107; Can you beat that? Personally, I want to know how, after 35 years, a fire in this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a lift that works? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this, obviously you do not pay much attention to what you spend your money and, therefore, you probably do not think about how silly that is the movie, but that does not mean we can not point it out and laugh. <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended to be demolished by any sensitive inspector) into a homeless shelter and think it is the best way to get it. cleaned is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh <br /> <br /> I think you know quite well what to expect, but I feel the need to give you a couple of warnings. First, if you hate interaction with the crowd regardless of the movie, then you'll want to stay away. The people in the audience acted as if they were in a real fighting program. Shouts of "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" He echoed through the theater, showing what I hope will NOT be the best of what the United States has to offer. In general, I do not appreciate such interaction with the audience, but for a cheese competition like this, I thought the comment was added to the value of the entertainment. However, I can see how others can be bothered by it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this should not even justify an explanation, the film does not move away from the gore. If, on seeing an ugly and large uncle tear the eyeballs directly from their sockets, he does not shout "fun movie night!" for you, then you know well and well to keep your mass. <br /> <br /> I must say I was a little surprised at the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I did not expect him to put himself in an acting clinic, but I was hoping he would have a nice phrase like "Say good night" (his character's last name is "Good night") just before killing a victim. Instead, he uttered four words throughout the film: "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he delivered them without problems! <br /> <br /> If I were a bad boy in a movie, then my slogan would be something like "Put on your BETTS!" or "All bets are off!" <br /> <br /> I would govern and you know it. We need a new genre term for horror films like See No Evil that induces so much involuntary laughter that you almost have to label them as comic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we will call them HOR-larious!
