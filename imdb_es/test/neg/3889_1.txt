Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless movies I've ever seen. No way, shape or form I would recommend it to anyone ... unless you're trying to sleep your children or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set the reels on fire before they were sent to the cinemas. Why? The plot of Days of Heaven is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences without dialogue make up a large part of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate. The climax of the story does not affect you: at this time, your brain has worked so hard to discover the plot and the set of hidden metaphors that your thinking ability is gone. The only things that work are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, which should hear the sound of Linda, the girl in the story, who speaks like a man. Now I'm dumb to see this movie. Do not let that happen to you.
