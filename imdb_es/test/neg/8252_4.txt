What about the mathematical geniuses that make critics flow? In my opinion, a BEAUTIFUL MIND was not so good (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year), while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards that were unmercifully lavished. <br /> <br /> First of all is the script. When I attended film school, I was told that GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example of how not to start a script and the tutor was right. This movie lacks any kind of opening hook and for the most part it is very, very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this, the script reader would have renounced it on page 15. <br /> <br /> Structure apart from the idea that a member of the American subclass is some kind of intellectual god that really It does not sound true. Ask yourself: if he is the most important character in the movie, how is it that he has spent his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single teacher of his childhood noticed his gift? Highly unlikely as it is the fact that he read so much mind expanding literature. And if Will is so smart, why is he so unaware of what happens to handsome young men in US prisons? <br /> <br /> But it's the casting that left a big part of the movie. Do you want a couple of actors to play Irish gang members? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, which is like having Russell Crowe play a pacifist or Charles Bronson play a liberal who does good. Damon and Affleck did not convince me because they talked about hitting people and they could not help thinking that although they wrote the script, the parts should have been delivered to different actors, after all Billy Bob Thornton has. Scripts written for movies that have not been released and the same criteria should have been applied here <br /> <br /> There are some positive points in the film. Robin Williams is excellent because the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard, who is simply one of the best actors of characters who stepped out of Europe and, despite my previous criticisms of the script, there is a great movement. piece of dialogue in the park while the Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer positive points than negative points in this film and I agree with the people who have said that GOOD WILL TO HUNT is boring and unconvincing
