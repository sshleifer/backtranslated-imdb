The idea is great, spoiled by the judges. <br /> <br /> Why make fun of people? if what the inventors say is true, and as most of them say, they dedicated their lives to saving invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun of people. <br /> <br /> It also shows when they want to accept an idea from the crier they added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only thing I respect about the judges is the one who always sits on the right side of the table, he is a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course, the English snob who claims to be a businessman, using a suite does not make you a friend <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, the big man Who sits between the Englishman and the town crier. wake up man, it is not called work and inventor so that you call yourself one. An inventor is an attribute, not an employee. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon of the American idol, they thought it worked there, it can also work here. the context is different and the idea is totally different. <br /> <br /> is a good idea and they could have done it with a good demonstration if they only change the judges and eliminate their act and attitude. <br /> <br /> just stop making fun of people.
