SHIT! I accidentally saw this movie thinking it was the Swimming Upstream that was launched in 2003. I seriously regret having lost an hour of my life sitting through it. Shame to who gave a prize to this garbage. I completely hated this movie, in fact I did not see it until the end. After an hour I could not take it anymore. I am disgusted that people have such a terrible script, that they try and fail to steal a dozen other stories of human interest and that performance of BA-AD. PAINFUL. I rate it with 1 star of 10. An amateur could make a movie much, much better.
