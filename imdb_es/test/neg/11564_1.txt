I'm not familiar with the other works of the producer, but this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you that Mike and the Bots probably did not save it. <br /> <br /> I love a grade-z movie as much as the next big bad movie fan, but this was almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> There was no credit for who made the voice of "The Dark One". It sounded a little like Patrick Stewart sometimes. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students who found a super-8 garbage chamber in the trash heap could make a better movie than that.
