From the scarcely strange sounding lasers, to an elementary school-style shuttle crash, "Nightbeast" is best classified as an absurd mix of fake blood and discovered chest. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from the lack of a cohesive or effective story. However, acting is not so beastly, many of the young, aspiring actors admirably show a hidden talent. In particular, Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who threw a very necessary fragment of light on this film otherwise terrible. Nightbeast would never have appeared on the set if he had known the terrible cinematic talent of this small town in Maryland.
