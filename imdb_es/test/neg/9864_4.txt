As long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright tactic, and it does not pretend to be a serious release, it is actually surprising that it is not absolutely horrible. I even liked the musical theme. <br /> <br /> And if ever a movie asked for a treatment by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K Bots, that's it! Look at this with a lot of smart cookies and good ass, and you'll be in a good time. Prepare a beer, put butter in some large pretzels and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Of course, getting a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you are here in the IMDb, then 'It is very likely that you are smart enough to do it. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part ... where Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have 12 hours to fulfill their wishes ... and actually points out the number "12" with their finger while doing it ... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" .... hoo boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm declares "Just look at me ... ..the Fanstastic Four" is so comforting ... you will laugh, you will cry ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you love Schlocky Sci-Fi, this is great for you. !
