This was a frightfully bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was horrible, it had nothing of the charm of Shirley Temple! Those dreadful smiles he would make when he wrinkled his little pigs in a way that I think was supposed to be cute and make the audience leave, "Aahhhh, bless!" It just made me want to slap her. She must have expressed "Oh, my God!" A hundred times throughout the movie. Besides, he could barely utter a sentence without accompanying her with a fake giggle. Horrible HORRIBLE movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would. Do not waste your money on this garbage, go out and buy a genuine Shirley Temple movie!
