Imagine if you would like an alternative universe where someone has made SEVEN where, instead of a cast and a talented team, he has chosen a politically conscious environmentalist and a comedian as protagonists. If your imagination can not stretch that far, just look at THE GLIMMER MAN as it is the next worst thing <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a policeman with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he has been played by Steven Seagal since he is also someone with a hidden past, but do not tell anyone because it is top secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became a movie star in the first place, since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in line with all the other Seagal films, since it's absolute shit. Look at the way he introduced himself when his partner walked into his office "Yoi love beads man." In the wrong office "Steven responds with something that is very clever, or he would do it if someone was able to understand a bloody word he said that during part of the movie he just mumbles away. In fact, the only time I could understand his dialogue was in the scene where he bursts into the gunman who holds the class hostage <br /> <br /> "Do not make me kill you" <br /> <br / > Is this what a police officer would say to an armed suicide man? I just think that in another film where Steven is not the hero (that is, a good movie) the policeman would say something like "Do not kill me, I have a wife and a couple of children waiting". at home. "So anyway, a suicide gunman is going to blow his head, but Steven saves his life by throwing them through two windows It goes without saying that you should not try this at home <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, Steven (I've stopped calling him Jack, though I credit the screen writer for giving Steven a sensible name) involved in a case, a plagiarism where someone has been stealing fragments from other top movies with murderers While Steven finds more victims, you can watch him think "What was that movie starring Morgan Freeman as a cop?" While inspecting the bodies, oh, and the action continues to change the hero's domestic life just so we know that this type is good As a family man, this guy is very good as a family man, it is a pity that he is as bad as a movie star.
