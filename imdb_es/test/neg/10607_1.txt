Pure shit, decent cinematography ... I liked some of the colors. Apart from that, this was one of the worst movies I've seen. Bored, lifeless, not once I found myself interested in any of the characters. I kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to accelerate the pace. Nothing ever happened! I think they spent too much time working on the hair and the wardrobe that they forgot that a movie was being made at that time.
