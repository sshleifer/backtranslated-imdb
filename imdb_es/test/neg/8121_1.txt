Seriously ... I'm surprised by the good opinion that this program has here. All we have in this program are two stupid children who keep making an annoyed laugh and do occasional OCCASIONAL things only in ... 2 of the programs, while most of the others stank ... as they then comment in music videos that Personally, I can not keep up with them while they love or like me. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, the only thing you'll hear is the "we're going to tag with some girls" or "I'll kick your ass", or better yet, and we usually use the quote " It was great ", and above all, his annoying laugh. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this program is not worth the time or energy needed to see this horrible MTV series with sincerity.
