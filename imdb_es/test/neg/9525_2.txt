The writing and the direction of Duncan Roy are really, and regularly, below the level. Actually it's like it sucks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, selfish) remake of Dorian Gray: an absurd and contorted dialogue between the characters of the "upper class", both idiotic and pretentious, amateur, to the core. The characterization and the script, and sometimes the acting, are squeaky as in a school play ... but, worse, there is a kind of self-confidence of the peacocks on the direction that destroys the soul when the director clearly does not give It counts ... it's not good. Diana Quick must be cowering in shame. DR, you should just get out of the movie ... seriously.
