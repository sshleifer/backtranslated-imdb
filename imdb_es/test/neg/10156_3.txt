Oh well ... it's funny. It should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror movies lack common sense, but I think a delayed caveman would make fun of this situation. Do not really expect Hitchcock or anything like this. This is a good option for friends, but I would not recommend it for anything else. This film lacks the essence of a true horror movie, suspense, surprise and good characters. the killer could not be the unstoppable force I expected him to be, and he seemed to be the average "D" student who was capable of outwitting the stupidest people. and the really funny thing is the horrible performance and the lack of emotion of the so-called "victims" <br /> <br /> 3/10, just wait for this in the daily activities.
