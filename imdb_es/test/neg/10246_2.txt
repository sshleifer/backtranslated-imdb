I have not yet seen STARCRASH (1979), that rather cheesy Italian note from STAR WARS (1977), but it can not be much worse than this malicious crap that, suffice to say, makes Mel Brooks regular. SPACEBALLS (1987) looks like a true work of art. In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered all over the world today is because of the tragic fate that happened to its protagonist: the Playboy center Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered by her incredibly jealous husband, before that the movie had its official premiere! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Statten (who subsequently made two biopics about her in which she was played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the lead role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being leaning on a chair apparently driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or another; In fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android that also serves the extravagant crew of their sandwiches, puts them all in the neck and even goes to look for the Blue Star (choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in his white attire and, although his role hardly demands much effort from any acting talent he may possess, it is not exactly demeaning either. <br /> <br /> However, it is ironic that for a film that bears his name, it is overshadowed by the extravagant pranks of his crewmates, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (who gives him the idea of ​​the level of comedy shown here), a long A man with ears, sporty wing color, an old Chinese who smokes in pots and proverbs and, best of all (relatively speaking) is a hairy, voracious and voracious alien creature that they hold. The villain of the piece is a non-entity dressed in metal who, however, laughs at the film when, upon hearing the choral music after each mention of the Blue Star, he exclaims: "What is this s ** t "It does not make much sense to list the classics of science fiction that are crushed by this stinker in their ridiculous attempts to falsify the genre, since they are not only unconvincing but also obvious; Incredibly, an alien ultimately, but ultimately benign, is apparently played by the diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, then, the scenes filmed on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish hue, similar to the sun and its inhabitants they are 'human gourmets' (delights in their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc.), do not mention a gang of motorcyclists serving their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape behind her, they dare not shoot them for fear of hitting their "Lord". God (horrible) in fact ...
