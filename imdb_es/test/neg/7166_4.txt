Once I saw fragments of this on television, and when a friend recommended it to me, I started looking for it, although it seemed that no place nearby had it. I finally got it at an antique store, and I could not wait to see it ... Oh, I had seen it a couple of years before and I really could have enjoyed it. I was surprised that this movie lasted only about 80 minutes, and I think this is what made the plot and the story so lacking. The plot really sounds good, both in the trailer and in the comments of the film: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newly discovered yellow lab, are isolated on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison). Together, they manage to survive the desert and hope to be found and rescued. Still, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very hasty. There is a possible love interest between Angus and Sara, but they never show together for more than a moment. Yellow is a naughty dog ​​that parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days it seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers) that vaguely mentions how death is for the child (Joel Palmer) is not going anywhere. In a short time, we learned that they have spent 9 days on the island, then, suddenly, they are 14, then 19. Of all the animals that a castaway could be exposed to in nature, only 1 type, a wolf , he attacks them. Why else could not it have been a problem instead of having the same kind of animal, maybe even the same one, attacking twice? There are few views of how Angus prepares food, except when he discovers fruit and roots, and when he catches a trapped rat. If he knows a lot about survival skills, why did not more scenes show up with that? The only thing that left me blank was why the dog did not have much part alone. When he is rescued, and the dog is left behind on the island, there is no scene that shows how he survives without the help of a human. I wanted to be more open to this when I looked at it, but I enjoyed some of this. The performance was good, and the score was nice. However, I was wondering why the father looked much older than his family, and why he and the main search and rescue driver share names. This is a good movie for children, but although the protagonist is 14 years old, nobody more than 10 would be interested.
