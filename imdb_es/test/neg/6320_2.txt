In the opening sequence of "Where is dad?", George Segal gets out of bed one morning, shaves, takes a shower, puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's room, we realize more late, to give her a massive heart attack that will kill Ella and take her out of her life forever. This is about the level of humor that can be expected from most of this image: madness, combined with what could be taken as a morbid audacity. <br /> <br /> Segal plays a New York lawyer who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is further complicated when, while hiring a nurse to take care of the old bag, he meets the girl of his dreams, Trish Van Devere, a nice scoop, dressed as Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate the charming nurse into his life and his annoying mother. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is almost the only thing that keeps the image together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic time is almost incomparable (what happened to that guy?); Where the film fails is in other areas. The characterization of Ruth Gordon is terrible as the mother. At first, you can not imagine if your character is senile or just being deliberately vague to prevent your child from moving. In the end, it is clear that she is crazy. When Segal takes Van Devere home to join her, Gordon frowns and gets a mean, sinister look. She wants the intruder in her son's life to be removed; she is calculating. This is not the way of a senile person. It is not getting consistent performance across the entire image, which is probably the fault of both the director (Carl Reiner) and Gordon's. The old woman of Ruth Gordon in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because with the type of congruent and cloying person that Ruth Gordon usually interprets, the audience responds to her as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to defend herself, Gordon becomes more cloying, his fangs sink more and more and we are afraid of Farrow; This type of imposition is really scary. In this case, they ask us to laugh at what we normally find annoying, and if Gordon played him like a helpless nut all the time, we could. But it is also selfish and petty, and moistens the little humor there is. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good laughs. A court scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counterculture punk is pretty funny, and Vincent Gardenia does a good job as a football coach in Lombardy. There is also a bit of inspiration where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), after being undressed by the robbers on his way to Segal's house, asks him for something to put him at home, and gives him the suit. gorilla. <br /> <br /> But much of the script is ill-conceived and simply does not make sense. Why does a New York lawyer with his own practice even live at home in the first place? Why Segal, if his mother is senile, tries to reason with her in a logical way: "If you ruin this, I'll punch you." Why is Liebman still going through the park if he knows he will be assaulted? Why do you take a taxi after leaving Segal with a gorilla suit? Why was not he taking taxis all the time? A little more fun would have been Liebman, like the gorilla, terrorizing the robbers. Why is Van Devere still coming back? After your first husband was crazy, why do you want to get involved with this group? I suppose if I put this to Carl Reiner, he would say: 'These are crazy, they do not have to make sense'. What a convenient way to excuse a louse script full of holes. The behavior from moment to moment of the characters may not have to make sense, but their motivations do, and that's where "Where is the dad?" falls apart; Situations are created only to have the gag, and the jaws are mostly in one go, they do not adapt to anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco. How he has acquired this boastful reputation as a pillar of comedy baffles me; Basically, his career has been holding a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks as they speak in funny voices. His son Rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director. In terms of show-biz, Reiner presses buttons; A monkey could do his job. And that is more evident in its framing of the action. Why all of New York is filmed in the foreground and in the foreground, but the scenes in the country are distant and panoramic? That is the mentality of Carl Reiner, claustrophobic for the city, space for the country. In the final lunatic scene in the house of the old, the camera is far away, you can not even distinguish what is happening. The abrupt end suggests a resolution to which Segal could have easily arrived ninety minutes ago; It also suggests that Reiner could not figure out how to finish the image. So he simply cut it off, as another example of "madness". Reiner seems to think that stupidity equals madness, and madness without logic is always funny. It is not, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are as crazy as Ruth Gordon who puts Pepsi in his Fruit Loops.
