This is a good program to see, it is not the best or the worst. I've seen it for a long time and I do not like anything new. This show has become something of teenage trash and is living in a very different way. I do not like that shit ... I do not have IQ why they completely changed the subject of this program. The first season was really nice to watch and it was partly fun. The second season is out of this silly world. Seriously, I do not know why the writers / directors changed this aspect. Many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. I will only watch the first season of this program from now on, whenever I see a new episode, I will change the photo channel ... they already heard me! Get a 3/10 because I enjoyed the 1st season a bit but I hated the 2nd and 3rd
