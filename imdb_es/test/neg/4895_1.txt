How is a totally unpleasant movie made from a story by one of the most famous authors in the United States? Watch this movie and find out. Maybe I'm overestimating author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed with "The heart is a lonely hunter" and I also expected something memorable here. Forget this. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with his short haircut and his clothes. I never found much to get excited in almost any movie, anyway. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How insulting is that? Unpleasant characters, one after the other. Well, maybe that's the book too, and I'm being unfair to this movie. I'm not familiar with the story other than what I saw on the screen and this was such an unattractive movie that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just a person upside down in a backward village. Outside of a good cinematography here and there, there is nothing to recommend. It's amazing how someone can sit for 100 minutes of this. <br /> <br /> I did not even realize how bad this is going. There's good news: this was the only movie directed by Simon Cowell.
