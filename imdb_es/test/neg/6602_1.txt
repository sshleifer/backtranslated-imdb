Usually, when a biographical television movie about a celebrity is published, it is, at the very least, countryside (that is, Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrible, cheap and boring television movie that has been done. If VH-1 is going to make a film for television, they have to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander, although endowed with the voice of Michael, is not a great dancer, he does not look anything like Michael and does not even have his manners downcast. VH-1 would have done better to hire a real impersonator, that way, when I see that Michael is going to undergo plastic surgery, it does not exactly go exactly the same. Why should we be surprised at the shrinking of Michael's nose when it is exactly the same size as at the beginning of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor can not act and looks nothing like her, and I do not even mean the woman as Janet Jackson. Terrible scripts and a serious case of embezzlement should prevent VH-1 from producing more movies. Flex Alexander would have done a JERMAINE JACKSON much better than Michael. Costumes Scams of garbage. Neverland? Joined images of news documents. Do not bother with this ... it's not worth even remotely. The only good piece of cast: the actor who plays Joseph Jackson and MAYBE the actress as Lisa Marie Presley, although he should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.
