"What symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we left the theater after seeing the Polish brother's hymn to Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is fine. But not much. "Northfork" adds to a good performance weakened by a monotonous cinematography that fails to make a coherent statement and a confusing story that irritates rather than captivates. working. It is from the beginning to the mid-1950s and a squad of state agents dressed identically, all with the appearance that they have just answered a casting call for "The Untouchables," have the job of relocating the recalcitrant inhabitants They do not appreciate their immediate danger as much as The reward offered to move. An exciting film against development is always a possibility, but let's face it: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances to achieve dignified living conditions and an economy driven in the history of the United States. Can we build dams without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film is less about the plight of homeowners than about a fantastic creation of the escapist imagination of a dying child. Nick Nolte is the priest who cares for the boy and much of what he says could have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to be heard. <br /> <br /> Alternating between black suit evacuation agents (working for "Lakefront" land when the dam creates that valuable cultivated surface) and a spooky collection of weirdos, the film does not develop any theme consistently or even interesting. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is poor. A washed, tenuous and depressive color permeates the entire film with a non-dramatic purpose. There is no reason for this vast terrain to be so grim. In fact, a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive, shadowy solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
