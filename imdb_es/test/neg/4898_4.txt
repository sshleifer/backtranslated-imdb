The great genius of the Australian comic Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and, sometimes, unpleasant comedy that was snatched from its release after only a few days. Sir Les Patterson, a drunken and lustful Australian diplomat, accidentally sets fire to an Arab potentate at the UN and is sent to his small country as punishment, arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader (American soap star Thaao Penghlis) in the throne. Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), almost accidentally thwarts a new leader's plan to release a deadly, disgusting virus, like AIDS in the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo like the woman President of the United States, the plaque on her desk read "President Rivers"! The extreme bad taste is mixed with the slapstick and the usual biting satire of Humphries in a movie that is more enjoyable in its many fun parts, than altogether. The fans of Dame Edna's television may be embarrassed by the presence of a different Madge Allsop, unfortunately, one that lacks the wonderful magical comedy of Emily Perry on paper. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by Mad Max's own man, George Miller. For fans of Humphries like me, essential. Everyone else, be careful.
