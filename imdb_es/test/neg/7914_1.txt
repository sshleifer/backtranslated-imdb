This movie is very scary with scenes in which the Devil uses Gabriel's horn to open Heaven and take out the good angel dogs and imprison them in Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances some songs about the joys of being bad, and in a moment, he eats a living rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie for free with a pizza. You have what you pay for.
