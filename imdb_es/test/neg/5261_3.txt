My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are best friends and have been for a year. What Moses does not know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, an undercover police officer, who is waiting for the right moment to arrest Moses and Frank Colton, a major criminal with whom Moses is involved. When Colton and Moses discover that Keats is a policeman, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he escapes after shooting Carter in the head, which does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the police and is taken as proof of Colton's wickedness. But when the cops, including Carter, are about to escort him across the country on a plane, all the other cops are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter has to stay alive, as well as take Moses. <br /> <br /> A fairly normal action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot, but much of the movie is just stupid. For a comedy, I found that most of the jokes were not entirely funny. But as an action movie, it has some pretty good action scenes. Not being a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the performance and, therefore, the characters, well below the level. The climax is not really great, and the movie is very unrealistic. It's not all bad, but not too good, and it's too short. Running below 85 minutes, I thought it was another 15 minutes before it was over, but there was not, and the movie felt very short. In general, it's not a total waste of time, but I still would not recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: Medium level violence, sexual references, medium level rude language <br /> <br /> Score: 56 out of 100
