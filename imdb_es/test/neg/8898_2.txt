Although I rarely agree with filmkr√∂nikan, I have to say that this movie, although it is not horrible, just did not make me worry at all ... and everything seemed out of place ... it had its moments ... three or four that made me laugh ... but most of the time I was sitting and wondering why? Why did the characters do this? even the Hot Shots characters felt more thought and developed ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie from Norrlands, look Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that were simply shot shooting in the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
