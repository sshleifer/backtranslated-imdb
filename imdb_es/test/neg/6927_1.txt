I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is wonderful. This movie is very far from the book. The book is splendid, this movie is a horrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong and NEVER does anything spiteful to respond to anyone. That is the POINT of the book! She behaves like "princes" regardless of the circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is not to return cruelty. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are treating it. <br /> <br /> In the book, she endures a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing their kindness and ability to endure without sinking into rancor and revenge. Sara does the right thing simply because it is CORRECT. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, he meets a beggar who is poorer and hungrier than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is very hungry. He gives a bun to this wild-looking little girl huddled on the threshold of the bakery. When she sees how hungry the girl is and looks at her, she swallows the bun, she gives him another. Keep doing this until you have given 3 or 4, I think. I do not remember how many. <br /> <br /> The baker is looking out the window. She is so touched by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are equally influenced by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in the book, his father died. The man next door is his father's partner, he's been looking for her. His father did not lose his money after all: the man is delighted to find Sara; He takes her and Becky home and raises them like his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweeper. In fact, she remains in her same position at school. But she feels humiliated when Sara has told her new guardian the cruel treatment she received. And Sara talks to Miss Minchin at the end: Miss Minchin is trying to minimize the treatment she gives Sara and Sara with a calm and firm attitude, and tells the young lady that she had been cruel. <br /> <br /> for Miss Minchin. She continues in her miserable existence. It does not matter, what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her, and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, now has her whole purpose and sister. <br /> <br /> The book is about love and honorable behavior in the worst circumstances. It is about self-control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This movie does NOTHING to capture the real story and the messages of the book. My wife was so upset with her, that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to keep it. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can not, for my life, think of one reason why the film creates should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the guantoso script of the book in which Shirley Temple acted. I do not know, but this movie is so far from the book in character and values ​​that I do not recognize it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a dad!
