I'm not from the United States, I usually watch this program on the AXN channel, I do not know why this respected channel broadcasts such a program at prime time. Creation of the Hollywood money bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he is spending a large amount of cash on the small screen. In each episode, a group of people who have two team members travel from one country to another for a large sum of money; Where camera teams shoot their trips. I do not know who the hell gave this stupid idea to the show. It has nothing to do, in all the episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes they scream, they cry, they sound, the camera works ... well, it is harmful to both the eyes and the ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that the spectators finally know that each member of the team can not enjoy their career / travel experience. Although, to add the qualifications, the producers came up with the idea of ​​including Gays in one of the programs, sucking the American reality show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see, better change to other channels. > <br /> The Amazing Race = The Disgusting Show.
