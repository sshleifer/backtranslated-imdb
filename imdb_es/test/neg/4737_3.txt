Anyone who has seen "Alien vs Predator" must have known that the conventions of the "Alien Quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the movie. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of extraterrestrials in a matter of minutes, extraterrestrials with extremely long tails, and so on. However, the idea that the Predator species provide the impetus for the construction of the city and the temple to create a hunt would be that the warriors were so attractive that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the end of the movie I will not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first movie ended, the dead Predator had an alien burst in the chest that bore the features of both species. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I'm just going to review a List of "good" and "bad" features. <br /> <br /> The good: many beautiful people, especially men. <br /> <br /> The bad: many beautiful people are chewed as much by the mutant Predator / Alien as by the Predator. <br /> <br /> The good: an interesting idea of ​​the planet Predator. <br /> <br /> The bad: an inconsistent scale of a city. It is a small city without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated sewer system (read: big city) and homeless. Is it a small city, or a city? The police force is a Sheriff and three Deputies, or so I counted. <br /> <br /> The good: Um ... <br /> <br /> The bad: Why do these alien / mutant predators grow? so fast? In a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to full size. I mean, come on ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens? And while we're on this topic, why is it that an Alien in the body of a Predator mutates, but an Alien in the body of a human does not? That makes sense? <br /> <br /> The good: Still thinking ... <br /> <br /> The bad: Why would only come a predator? And why does he pour acid on all the remains of the "aliens", but decides to kill a nice agent, and then skin him and hang him upside down? I mean, so much for being incognito! <br /> <br /> The good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I guess there are many loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The bad: How are these Alien / mutated Predators procreated? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kissing movement, they deposit several young in the body of the woman. Yes, just what you would like to see, huh? Pregnant women who have their bodies explode into mutant aliens, as if the previous form was not serious enough. I mean, there's not even an alien queen. <br /> <br /> The good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are beautiful? <br /> <br /> The bad: when a nuclear device destroys buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the explosion? And how dangerous is it for one of the passengers to derisively reprimand the pilot? "I told you not to crash!" I mean, given the nuclear rain, when he wakes up in the morning, he will not have hair left. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you understand the message. The mutated Alien / Predator bursts through the body of the dead Predator, grows with the question of a couple of minutes, kills all the Predators and manages to crash into the ground. More mutant Alien / Predators are created, while a miserable Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. The predator kills humans. Alien mutants / predators kill humans. Humans kill humans. Sucks for being a human in this movie, huh? <br /> <br /> If you are impressed by many explosions, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked the First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
