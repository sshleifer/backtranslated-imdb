Unlike the other spaghetti westerns, it has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some extent. He still has the ridiculous weapons game of other spaghettis westerns. A spaghetti, by the way, is another word for a Westerner without an argument, without characters that might interest you, and a silly shooting game that makes no sense for the era, and trusting good music to make the audience feel something . This one is more cheerful, like the ones that Bud Spencer and Terence Hill did together. They were also superior to the trash made by Eastwood and others, which sadomasochists make their friends see, if they have the opportunity. It seems that everyone also had a lot of fun doing the movie. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who was not even mentioned in the movie rental box, but who clearly was the biggest name. Your character was very nice. There is a three-way separation at the end, which is far superior to the one that simulates (the good, the bad and the ugly), simply because the characters are at least a little pleasant and a little identifiable. It's not a good movie, but it has a bit of fun.
