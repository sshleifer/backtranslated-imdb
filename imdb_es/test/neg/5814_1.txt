I found this jewel on a shelf that the local video rental store had of ribbons that are exchanged between several rental points. 'The man who dodged Everest'. Hmm ... I've never heard of that. The box says of a Japanese companion who always wanted to ski for Everest and he did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I always wanted to ski on Mount Everest". This is followed by some images of preparation for the event. Lots of preparation images. OK, I guess it takes a lot of preparation. Then they invite us to a prolonged piece about the skier, the philosophy of life of Yuichiro Miura, etc. Continue filling and I begin to wonder where the ski fits in this show. It shows more preparation and begin to make the trip to the mountain. It shows more philosophy. At last they reach the mountain and maybe he can go skiing along the way. Much amount of material to climb later, there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow down Miuras on the steep slope. Finally, he puts the straps on the skis and prepares to go. <br /> <br /> He's gone ... He skis about twenty feet and his skis come out from under him, unfolds the parachute and falls into an inglorious package for a certain distance down the mountain and that's it. End of story. What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Well, I can buy that he always wanted to ski on Everest, made extensive preparations and tried it out with the camera crew in tow. It did not work and it ended up falling and almost killing itself, so what outrageous arrogance would inspire the man to launch a movie and call it skiing on Everest? Maybe the title "The man whose feet came out from under him and slid down his ass down on Everest" was too long for the tape box.
