Shortly after this movie premiered, Salman Khan received a 6-year prison term. (Read more to know why I mention it). <br /> <br /> And I let out a sigh of relief. I was not happy He came to jail for something that, because he was a celebrity, but I was happy because this meant that there were no more Salman Khan movies, no more his histrionics and no more over exaggerated acting (read Exaggerating). <br /> <br /> This movie does not make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> The scene where the child belonging to one of the family makes a rocket that was activated by voice. According to the script of the movie, I would chase anyone. But ultimately, only Salman Khan Bare Chested is found. Well, this is what happened. <br /> <br /> The Rocked is activated in another senseless way and you have to have an IQ of .001 to believe it. Then chase Salman Khan, who was on his jet ski and the chase continues unless he's finished with all the possible stunts he could show to the senseless audience. (In my opinion, all those people who have given this movie for 5 years or more, unless they are paid for doing that). <br /> <br /> Another incredible scene in the end was amazing when all the arrangements about the marriage were made and Salman Khan with Govinda in disguise comes and stops the marriage for another one of those highly undesirable songs. Later, even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and Katrina Kaif to the Father and Katrina Bingo. Everything is fine and Govinda marries Kartina ... <br /> <br /> This made me wonder if convincing was so easy, why did not they do it and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money? <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided and do not even think there is a scene worth watching. The plot is too disconnected with the characters that appear out of nowhere and finally vanish ... for the former Choota don ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie I made a commitment that I would not see Salman Khan Movies for the rest of my life unless I won an Oskar ... (hahahah ... which means I would never see it)
