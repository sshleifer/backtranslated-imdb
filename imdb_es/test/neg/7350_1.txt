Willzyx Free (the most stupid name / title of all time) is the worst episode of ANY of the TV shows I see, which includes X Files, Alias, The 3 Laws and Orders, All CSI, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show, Colbert Report, and more. South Park was for a long time my favorite of the comedy shows, due to its surprisingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy. Willzyk Free has NONE of the content I mentioned above. It was so docile, so offensive that it could have been an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World where some of the workers make a joke, making him think that a whale is talking to him. ANTECEDE TO THE WHALE, IN DEED, LEARN IT. Hello? This is South Park! the same program that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance", and many more! No SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh In fact, I saw the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life that I will never go back. Anyway, I was extremely disgusted with this episode and I can not believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
