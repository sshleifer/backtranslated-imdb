Very strange. But destined to be. This director is his own man. Even through the strains, Polanski, Bergman and Kafka, at least in episode # 6, the one that furtively looks. What made everything so strange, and that he remembered the three previous artists, was that he traveled all over the place, never knew where he was going and could have ended up anywhere, and finally, when he finished, he could have continued. The end is not an end, nobody could tell you what these two characters would do even in the next frame. Another thing that should be said about the director: it is not surprising that Kubrick finds it fascinating. There are many Eyes Wide Shut in this episode in some way, in the direct focus of the character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without any of the severe effects, much more discolored and hurried, not so annoying. That said, going back to the beginning, even this guy has his own things to say and he says them well. However, for some reason, there is not a single scene that you want to see again. But he definitely did not feel cheated in the least to see it once. But I still had the feeling that three or four ghost directors were moving through the parade, erasing everything. The warning is that it was only episode six: the other nine can give me completely different shots. But as this episode revolved around looking furtively, searching, the absolute dominance of the film, I will say this, he did not take any of the usual routes, he definitely followed his own path while carrying the luggage of many good directors behind him.
