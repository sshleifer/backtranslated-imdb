One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Completely ridiculous The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The physics of holograms is hilarious because of the degree to which they are completely wrong. My God, I even want to believe that this movie has the Disney label. Yuk The actresses are a bit beautiful, but there are so many good movies with amazing actresses that are much more valuable to watch than this one. Final comment, bad movie. Do not bother to see it. If you are looking for movies to watch with your children, consider other alternatives such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or Enchanted Story (in theaters). Seriously.
