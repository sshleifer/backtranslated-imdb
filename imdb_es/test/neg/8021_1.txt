I can say with confidence that this is the worst movie I've seen, and I usually like foreign films. The movie is nothing more than a bad pornography. If you decide to watch it, get ready for endless sexism, free nudity shots and a stupid tabloid rape scene, which I'm sure is the main attraction for people who like the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot meanders aimlessly, and none of the characters is pleasant. Many scenes are filmed from the forest surrounding the river where the girls are to give a constant feeling that someone is harassing them, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of history to tell. <br /> <br /> Maybe I would not have wasted the time to see the movie if it had been described accurately in the reviews.
