I am surprised that "The Hospital" has been so well received by critics and the public. I found it sad, visually ugly and generally meaningless. After the first 40 virtually indecipherable minutes, the film improves (relatively), but it's still too exaggerated (not to mention it's not funny) to succeed as a satire, and it has very little substance to succeed as a drama. The uncertain tone of the film is its biggest flaw, eclipsing even Scott's excellent performance (as always).
