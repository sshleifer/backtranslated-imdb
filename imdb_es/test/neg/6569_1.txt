Leonard Nimoy directed Star Trek III, which was not bad at all. Maybe William Shatner thought that, as Nimoy did, he could. After seeing this movie, I should have reversed that decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The latest Frontier is the worst in the series. The performance of everyone involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad, it washes and makes them look as old as they look in real life, the special effects are sticky, like when Spock has to rescue Kirk in a Jet pack when it falls. down a mountain. <br /> <br /> The humorous attempts were regrettable and the story is so horrible that I can not think of what basically implies that a Vulcan steal the Company to find God (seriously), I just did not do it. Worry about any of this movie and, not to mention, Uhura does a belly dance to distract the male guards. It seemed like I was participating in a grandmothers competition. If they wanted to make her look sexy. They were wrong. It seemed grotesque. <br /> <br /> How this came to production or even written ... well, you do not have to think about that. The only good place for this movie is in the trash. The worst of the series.
