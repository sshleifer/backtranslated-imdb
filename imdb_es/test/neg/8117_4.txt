Almost everything that Stephen King has written seems to have become a movie or television series; In fact, I'm surprised that nobody tried to make a miniseries of the guy's shopping list. Let's face it, if they did, it could not be less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King's many tales, this 1984 horror movie sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing. a couple on a long automobile trip that runs into a place of discomfort when they risk the sleepy city of Gatlin, Nebraska, where all adults have been killed by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the cornfields. <br /> <br /> Although the director Fritz Kiersch manages to build a good amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's song and dance, but before we meet the monstrous Isaac, leader of the murderous children) , he blows it completely with interminable and unexciting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are persecuted by the homicidal half-tails of the city. Courtney Gains, like the violent redhead Malachai, manages to look genuinely threatening, but the rest of the children are not at all threatening; As a result, many of the 'frightening' moments in the film do not work. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding Gatlin, the film descends to an avalanche of terrible visual effects of the 80s that probably looked pretty well for almost 25 years. A long time ago, but look positive today. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn might interest King fans who want to see how the writer's work has translated to the big screen, but your average horror movie fan will be more impressed.
