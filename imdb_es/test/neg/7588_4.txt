As it happens, IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II had entries in the book 50 Worst Movies by Harry Medved. Now, I do believe that declaring that they are among the worst movies in history is an exaggeration, although they are still pretty bad movies, especially the first one, as it presented more glances and "goggle-eyed looks" than I've ever seen. before!! The director Eisenstein and a lot of other people thought that this made the film "artistic and profound", and since I am legally healthy, I must say that I hated this first movie !! The second, although it still has a very incomplete aspect, is a great improvement, since the movement of the eyes is minimal, although the exaggerated and boring scenes are present in this film as in part 1! While part 2 looks quite incomplete and takes at least another hour (especially because it never reaches Ivan's insane behavior later in life, like killing his son and heir in a fit of rage). Since both parties 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both justify their own murderous reign and glorify it, it is not surprising that the story of Ivan's life is very incomplete. Even without all of Ivan's truly horrible behavior, apparently the evil Stalin STILL did not like the movie and would not allow it to be released during his life. Maybe he did not allow it because he was more concerned that people would see the BIG loss of money and resources from the movie instead of seeing Stalin as crazy as Ivan! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was a segment of this tedious movie that was so cool that the movie deserves a 4 (without it, a 2), and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It's well done and it's pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was made in a Russian version of 2 colors tecnicolor. This is VERY strange, by the way, because in the mid-1930s, Technicolor developed a truly enhanced true-color process that no longer made everything look all-orange-red and blue-green. Therefore, this film during color sequences looks a lot like a movie in early or silent sound color. Very strange for the forties.
