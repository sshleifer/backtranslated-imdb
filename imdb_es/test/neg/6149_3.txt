But, again, what is it? I picked this up at my local 99cent store, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus taxes). I remember seeing this in a video when I was a teenager and I thought it was a good movie. Too bad the movie and my memories do not match. In any case, it's not a horrible way to fly a couple of hours, and it's nice to see some old Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah ... Blah .... Blah ... Man, oh man, I can not think of anything else to say about this movie ... (I'm just filling the space to meet the rule of the ten lines ... ), this is pathetic, how bad is this movie that the best I could find about it were five lines of text? So anyway, ten lines of text, huh? Hmmm, it's hard to find ten lines when you can not remember anything about a movie you just saw.
