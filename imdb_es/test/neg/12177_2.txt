If this movie had been in English, all the critics would have destroyed it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are terribly directed and it's not funny at all. After the movie, I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grade student, at least if you consider the lack of credible characters and the fixation on certain parts of the male body. (oh, also in dogs ...) The story is a simple nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar vinglas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar av glas received little attention. <br /> <br /> What really disturbed me was the fact that the movie looked very bad. It was probably due to the fact that the director of the first time, Josef Fares, used a really cheap camera equipment and then decided to play with him, for fun, I suppose. However, the result is a film that can be easily divided into 12 short films with a new style of direction in each of them. This was very frustrating. Maybe Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films, as it seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold up. On several occasions, in the middle of the movie, the story has to move very quickly and the characters bump into each other in a way that is too incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I have not mentioned two-dimensional characters, especially those in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Although I think this is one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s and one of the most overrated, it is understandable that the public liked it. I mean, bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that critics have enjoyed it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
