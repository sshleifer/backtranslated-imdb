Principal / actor Dutcher delights in this look-at-me movie, in which he tries to gain worldly acceptance to tarnish the otherwise highly optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the performances are fair. But some roles are not realistic, that is, the ominous (rather than paternal) President of the Mission, etc. The film gives a fair look at how some missionaries can fight with their faith, but the true missionary program that he claims to represent is far from his concept. of it, in terms of being optimistic, cohesive and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this movie is Dutcher's self-inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the shoot and script look like a college student project.
