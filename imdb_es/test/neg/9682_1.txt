This version of "The Ark of Noah" has established the reputation of Hallmark (and Turner) in about 100 years. However, production has its positive side ... a learning experience for neophyte entrepreneurs in "how not to make a movie". <br /> <br /> In the annals of biblical literature and common sense these quotes can be found. and situations: <br /> <br /> "Ok, guys, saddle." "It's a pity that God created the sun to shine only during the day, when we really needed it at night." "We do not kiss ... we just whisper in the mouths of others." <br /> <br /> Wood to build the Ark with "Georgia Pacific" stamped on it. Metal nails Children flying kites. A street vendor (how can James Coburn sleep after this) selling Chinese hats? Pirates attacking a wooden Ark, that they wished to capture, with flaming balls of fire fired from catapults. Wine glass bottles (Noah was in a continuous state of inibriation, it was a miracle that he could see the Ark, much less build it). Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg with a blond wig that surrounds the Ark on a white horse ... still classified G) Protect the biblical pirates with an iron pan (Teflon-lined?). Landing on Mount Ararat after having passed through the Straits of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... you have to see them in To not believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This movie should not be lost; but if you want the full version of TV, you must call NBC to get the screen version ... but only if you agree to absolve NBC of all responsibility for having issued the device in the first place. There is only the expurgated version in the video stores (not pirates, etc.) ... that is, the video stores that dare to store it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
