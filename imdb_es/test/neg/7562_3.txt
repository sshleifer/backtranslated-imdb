I watched the movie many times, and each time I get disappointed more and more, which is a shame because EX YU movies are usually very good. The shame here is that Holiwood tried to make a movie about the place and the people who have no idea. My own self from the Balkans (Macedonia) found this film disappointing. Simply, Bosnian characters do not really understand each other and do not really portray themselves. To understand the mentality of a person of EX YU, you must know their origin, way of life, what makes them cry and laugh. And the director of the film did not take it as a guide. When we (EX YU) make films, a lot of symbolism is built, which makes the characters recognizable and pleasant, and mostly portrays the truth (if based on a true story). Films like "Pritty village, pretty flame", "Tito and me", "Underground", "No man's land", "Before the rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu", ( When the father was away for business), "Ko to tamo peva" (Who sings there?) Rare the masterpiece of Balkan cinematography, and nothing can compare with it. It's not half story and Holiwood's study. As someone on the panel mentioned that the story jumps from one end of the city to the other without a real connection. I am sorry, but when the film is made it is not only for the variety of spectators in the American armchair, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them also live in the Balkans and Sarajevo. To the injury, half of things shoot up in Bitola, Macedonia, where I come from. Picture my surprise when I saw the wide street of Bitola in the opening. Scene from the movie, when the girlfriend is shot by the sniper. And what was that about inserting real images of the news covering the film? Anyway very disappointing, since the truth is very far from the movie. It is a pity that no one has consulted real people about how to live under fire in Sarajevo, before filming the film. The book is one thing and real life is another, and this film disappoints both.
