If the League had been unknown when launching this script, the supporters would simply have turned around and said "no, you do not have the money, this is terrible". As a fan of the League of Knights, this is his poorest exit to date. It is not particularly fun, it is not particularly entertaining, there are few moments of laughter out loud. They exist, but they are few and far between. I felt that the format was tired and really dragged. The film refers to the boring writers of the characters and it shows. As for being a movie. I felt that the Christmas special had better production value; the FX are generally quite poor and it is evident that they did not film in the original Royston Vasey (they filmed it at a low price in Ireland). The musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. In addition, the accents of the characters were largely outside of their television equivalents. Tubs and Edward, very underutilized (again), just did not sound like themselves. Really disappointing, because I expected something much more entertaining. This really was the equivalent of the league to the comedies of the 70s where the cast goes to Spain ...
