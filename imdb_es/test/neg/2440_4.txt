Justine can not find the perfect companion so that her first time is the perfect one. With a geek friend in tow, enter a virtual machine to improve its appearance. When you see the opportunity to create your perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sexual jokes are left? How predictable can this type of film be? A few funny moments here and there, but nothing too scandalous or different from the jokes in other movies or even in normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with the 'gender identity crisis', then, of course, these 90 minutes, you could enjoy.
