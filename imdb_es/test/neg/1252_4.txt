This movie tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they forgot is that their life was entertaining enough by itself without having to recover things. <br /> <br /> A brief list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts, he spent most of the time in Florida first, and he only went to Las Vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never partnered (or played Gin) with a casino executive (like the one Pat Morita played in the movie). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magical change in the preparation for the 1997 WSOP. In fact, Stuey just arrived at the tournament as it was. He snorted cocaine the previous week even. <br /> <br /> Either tell the story or do not account at all. 4 out of 10 stars for the credible performance of Michael Imperolli (the only redeeming quality of this movie).
