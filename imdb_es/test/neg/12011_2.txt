"Problem Child" was a good movie, but did it really deserve a sequel? I do not think he did it. Gilbert Gottfried was the only redeeming asset of the original film, and he was not even good at this sequel. <br /> <br /> I really can not explain why this movie was bad. For starters, it just was not funny. Even when I saw this when I was nine years old, I did not sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character appeared to me as querulous, hateful to himself, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. He seemed to hate all the women his father Ben (John Ritter) came out with for the sole fact of hating them. Nor does it send a good message to children with divorced parents (who make up more than half of the children in the United States these days) when the only woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is vengeful and who hates to children as is. <br /> <br /> And as great as I thought it would have been to see Laraine Newman, the original SNL co-star, go back to the big screen, she could not even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white southern debutante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like the name of an African-American woman. But, of course, that has nothing to do with the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie did not work because you had antagonists that you had to hate, along with protagonists you were not supposed to hate. It was assumed that the character of John Ritter was a good father who was desperately trying to teach his son to correct the wrong, without adjusting to authoritarian upbringing. Instead, he detached himself not only as a weak father, but also as one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, no matter how well he knew the woman. Did I mention that this sends a bad message to the children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In short, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck, an unnecessary and inexplicable return to play a completely different character. , that young woman who was even more detestable than Junior, completely out of place for toilet humor, and even more indecent and homophobic humor (involving dog hunters). The movie was just a mess, and it really does not deserve a DVD release if one has not yet been released. It should only rot in VHS along with all the other bad and forgettable comedies of the 90s.
