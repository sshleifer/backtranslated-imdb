Compared to the latest ARAB ADVENTURE by director Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. However, that does not say much. In fact, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is a stupid fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing, who seems to be in something strong, and another actor (whom I do not know) uses a giant digging machine called "Iron Mole". to the core of the Earth, only to discover that the interior of the Earth is pink and is populated by creatures similar to the apes that have enslaved humans. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys by means of telepathy, and we can see it blinking closely throughout the film. The most important thing is that Cushing and his name also meet the lovely Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And this is what I really have against this little movie: why, oh, why when Munro is in a movie, he only gets approx. 5 minutes of screen time? In THE SPIRIT WHO LOVED ME, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD: it is always in the background! How can Kevin Connor possibly think that we would prefer to hear Peter Cushing's fake accent and look at a ridiculous ape man whose voice sounds like a scratched CD to look at the beautiful Munro? I do not understand. Please, someone direct a movie where this English brunette is on screen all the time!
