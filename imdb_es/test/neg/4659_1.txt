This 'disintegrator' must carry a government health warning. If you play it on your DVD machine, you run a great risk of opening a crack in the space-time continuum and disappearing without leaving a trace on it. So bad is this "movie". <br /> <br /> The fact that This movie was so successful as evidence of the true desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema, and the continued commitment of films that appeal to the "lowest common denominator", although I really fear thinking about the "lowest common denominators" that this movie really appeals to! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood was doing a trial test when they did and screened this movie! I imagine the meetings of the executive boardroom in the studio ... "What a bad movie we got away with, and YET make a lot of money! Oh, my cow, I did not realize we could go SO bad! !! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only movies worse than this one I can think of (and believe me it's close) are Die Another Day (RIP the Bond franchise as I knew it) and Independence! Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!
