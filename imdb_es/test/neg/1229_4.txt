This is a poor caricature of "Lonesome Dove," and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" among the first three. I have admired the way you see yourself, through your characters, with an unwavering honesty, balanced by never taking it so seriously. I am, therefore, spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you get to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" is not up to your standards. I see that you are credited with writing the screen, but this is very different from you, I prefer to think that it is written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic, wishing that someone breaks up with a phrase declared naturally. The part about 'genius' was agonizing. McCrae was unrecognizable, mainly because of the foolish words that came out of his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I also miss Call. <br /> <br /> The most important factors that are missing are Gus and Call and Men are: their courage in fact; the underlying vein comprised by ethics and honesty; his lack of self-deception. Hard men who lead hard lives with some undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some fault has to be attributed to the laborious leadership here and everywhere. All the cast needed dialect And training with dialogue. <br /> <br /> While I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, speaking this same dialogue, it comes out better, but not much. Try to sound like a cowboy of few words timid, clever-clever grin, but not half successful ... <br /> <br /> How can it be so different from "Loneome Dove"? Can the writer have forgotten his characters? He has cheated some of the people, Mr. McMurtry, but not this one.
