It's a pity they did not trust the original to build it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that the sequels have to offer. <br /> <br /> The initial commercial was nice and so was the scene that follows (which recalls the beginning in "Guys and Dolls"!) but apart from a flash of thought here and there, this is a movie that It is a slow and dirty slog in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The ideas are introduced and then deleted, the interesting characters of the original barely have screen time here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they would not resist no matter what What movie, and then there is the tone. <br /> <br /> In the blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to lead with the kind of attitude in which if he increased the attitude and sensitivity of a good pulp comic, even the most repellent violence would be entertaining. Kershner (although he directed a sequel to "Star Wars") does not. And scene after scene makes you tremble, look away or just disconnect. <br /> <br /> And what about RoboCop? He should be the main thing here, right? But there are complete scenes in which he does not even appear, and the scenes in which he finds himself are so badly thought out and shaky that you do not know or if you care whether he is partly human or partly cyborg, since he is totally bored. . <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a rapid fall of grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad sequels? On purpose? Why; Did the filmmakers bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; The effects are good, but the story does not even try to match them.
