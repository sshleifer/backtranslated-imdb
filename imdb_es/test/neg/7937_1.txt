Is it me, or is it a horrible movie? I'm leaving with an INCREDIBLE movie ... <br /> <br /> Knowing very well that it's a movie for men (generally defined as full of car chases, shocks, shootings, explosions, etc.), I still hope Some small degree of credibility. If I can not believe the premise in any way, the movie WILL NOT WORK. Therefore, we come to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13". <br /> <br /> It's not one of the spoilers, I never inform details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here, because the plot is SO inane. The bad boy is imprisoned in Precinct 13. The friends of the bad boy want to get him out. Surprise. The friends of the bad guys are really corrupt cops. A young policeman, melancholy and worried, but heroic, saves the day while he talks to the girl. UGH. Yes, it really is that simple, and that fool. <br /> <br /> "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. It's not a bad scenario for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Even so, it is outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I've spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can not imagine how the final chase ended in the forest in downtown Detroit. I must have lost it ... <br /> <br /> There are NO refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money There were too many good movies in 2005 to spend up to $ 3.00 on Blockbuster with this one. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE: 1 <br /> <br /> (Only because I've seen worse movies).
