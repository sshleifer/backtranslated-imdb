Feeling Minnesota is one of the worst movies I've seen, and it's also one of the most disgusting movies ever made. It has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a nasty mobster. At the wedding she meets her brother Jjaks. They have sex in the house after eating the cake and then decide to run away together. The other brother, of course, comes after him firing weapons and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find his corpse in the bathtub and buries it. He seems to be friends with Jjaks and they try to raise money because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body. This goes around and several characters die or come back to life, but never come together with anything that can be called a good plot. The performances are horrible for almost everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. The direction, the dialogue and the visual effects are simply horrible. A disgusting and horrible movie.
