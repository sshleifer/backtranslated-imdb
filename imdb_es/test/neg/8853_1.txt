Kairo, or Pulse as it is known among the English-speaking public, is established in Tokyo and begins as Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso), an employee of Sunny Plant Sales, decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to ask for a record of computer that you have been working on. When she arrives at his place, he hands her the disk, but then commits suicide in an inconsiderate manner in front of her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) recently connected to the Internet and continues to receive spooky messages and images on his monitor, so he asks the computer Hariz Karasawa (Koyuki) what is going on, she really does not know, but it seems that the place where the spirits of people go when they die is full and they need somewhere else to go and the Earth is as good a place as any, right? These spirits do not like to share, because they make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something, I do not know because the movies are a little messy ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was Written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and I have to say that he hated Kairo, hated everything about it and demonstrates without a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as horrible as any American filmmaker. The script is a mess too long, the thing simply does not make sense with scenes that seem to come from a different movie, sequences that have no logical meaning or are not explained in any way. Kairo is also the most boring movie. I've sat through this year. After two hours, it is a real task to sit down, I really wanted to move forward, but I am just and nothing more, so I placed it in the final bitter and frankly wished I had not done it. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were looking for an ambiguous and deliberately incoherent surrealist feel, but those are traits that I despise in a movie unless they are performed correctly. Then there's the whole Internet thing that I just could not relate to, I use the Internet all day and it does not scare me in the slightest in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo, as a film, did not offer any entertainment value to me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I like the movies I watch to entertain me, make some sense and not get bored to death. <Br /> <br /> Director Kurosawa has made the best cure for insomnia as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble sleeping, save it on the DVD and sleep quickly within 10 minutes, I guarantee. I did not think Kairo was terrifying in the least, the whole Internet thing was ridiculous and in terms of fear, I should see some of the emerging penis enlargement ads that I get, now that's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry, I just need to do that basic point again, twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore since there is none. If you have a very nervous disposition, then maybe there are a couple of scenes that could scare you, otherwise, this is something for children, classified for PG. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so boring and boring that it is not true, the camera stays there for very long shots and when it moves it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is subtitled, it is difficult to judge the original performances, so I will not be bothered, it is difficult to take care of someone when they do not even speak the same language and you do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Kairo is crap, I hated him and he's as simple and direct as that. The fact that it is an Asian movie does not automatically make it good and the clutter of a story, the holes in the plot, the fact that it makes no sense and that it is absolute boredom means that Kairo, rightly so, would be torn apart by the if it were an American production The worst movie I've seen this year for a certain distance. Kairo got a Hollywood remake like Pulse (2006).
