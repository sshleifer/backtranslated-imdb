I'm very disappointed. After waiting 3 years for the replays / DVD of the original series of the masterpiece "Darkplace", I could not wait for this series. The first episode has just ended and I am horrified. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been deleted here, more or less. The worst introduction: canned laughter. this removes the original point of it and simply makes it almost inadmissible. (A joke about Garth's eyes to fertilize the audience was good ... the rest I can barely remember ...) It feels like a bad quality "Knowing Me, Knowing You". I hope this improves as the series progresses, otherwise I will be very disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I have ever met, and I know God ..."
