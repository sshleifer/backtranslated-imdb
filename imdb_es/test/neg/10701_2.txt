This movie sucked. There is not much more than that. The final fight seemed like Walker was facing my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the most interesting ads. The twists and turns of the plot could be seen coming a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that it ended. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you enjoy the bad films of Chuck Norris.
