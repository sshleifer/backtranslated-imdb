Normally I do not try to guess a crime thriller, but Cleaner was too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, however, that was it. Without even thinking about where the plot would be taken and in 30 minutes had already discovered who was the murderer. Instead of trusting myself and having seen several movies that take a turn, I watched until its completion. What a disappointment, he was right from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters was good, as was the performance of Jackson and Harris ... except Eva Mendes. From the door of departure, he did not play a credible character in correlation with the script and this ruined the whole plot too soon. Maybe this was a direct setback or simply a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and anguish for the situation that surrounded her. This would have made the accumulation a bit more convincing and the ending more dramatic. However, Cleaner is observable, not memorable. I have seen episodes of CSI that were more exciting than this.
