Something strange is happening in remote areas of the Arctic. A meteorological station of the Air Force is destroyed and its occupants are missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing boat disappears. Spoors are curious in the snow. A four-foot piece of a living organism is found near a destroyed plane. The piece looks like half the claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as an Air Force officer) and his experts are baffled. A distinguished scientist (William Hopper) and his sympathetic assistant (Alix Taltan) are called from New York. Hopper deduces from this flimsy evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous praying mantis. He is right. The pretty assistant looks out the office window and sees the horrible face with her bulging eyes looking at her. She drops what she is carrying, she puts her hands to her cheeks and screams in horror. <br /> <br /> The mantis begins to fly southward along the Gulf Stream, stopping again and again to attack major population centers such as Washington and New York. Dump buses and eat people. The military weapons do not affect much, but finally Stevens crashes into him in his jet fighter and mortally damages the beast, which comes to Earth and occupies the "Manhattan Tunnel" that links New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, having survived the collision, leads his team to the tunnel and kills the great insect with "3RG mines" despite its ferocious appearance, threatening behavior and roars that shake the earth. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper chuckles and takes a picture of them. <br /> <br /> Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Like the mortal mantis itself, the formula at this moment was panting and gasping for air, tumbling, looking like its prey not human beings but anything in the sense of a fresh or original idea. As it is, they missed a clich√©. Hopper should have rushed to invent a Super Duper DDT that, alone, could defeat the insect. That's what the 3RG mines should have been filled with, instead of the ordinary explosive. <br /> <br /> The model work is pretty good, considering what the budget should have been. You could not have spent a lot of money on something else because everything else is pretty routine. Craig Stevens is insipid, a face and a style created for a television series. William Hopper looks good, tall and silver, but his instrument only has one note. The pretty assistant is quite simple, considering her role. The part asks Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. Neither could they act, but they carried with them slight but distinct suggestions of annoyance. Anything would have helped this movie run out. <br /> <br /> I wish the mortal mantis had not roared so loudly and so often because you can not roar, you can not even whisper, if you do not have lungs. However, I did not care when the monster found its demise in the tunnel. A praying mantis is a funny insect in its own way and it's great to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and all that. But when you get to that, they are not really very attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the couple is almost copulating, the female removes the male's head, as well as humans. But at least the human males know when to stop. The male mantis keeps copulating for several minutes even though he is now headless. We humans do not have mindless males copulating with females with objectives. We make?
