This story begins at the end! So the opening credits of the film advise us. Unfortunately, that is not true, since then we are treated about 70 minutes of a typical science fiction movie of the fifties. The story is sad; The plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed with a low budget, as was the case in those days. <br /> <br /> The story could have covered any situation in which people take refuge in an isolated house and find themselves threatened by someone from outside. it turned out that it was adapted to fit a science fiction story. <br /> <br /> The landscape consisted of some rocks, bushes and smoke. - Oh, yes, there was also a pool of water. Someone was wearing a rubber mask with a beak like a face and what looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who wrote several science fiction stories at that time, including The She Creature and It Conquered The World The filming was completed in a matter of days, which did not allow the actors they will develop their characters better. The low budget restrictions also prevented this film from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better movie than it turned out to be. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning gave some life to the movie, but even they could not take this film to the category in which it could be said. - "I enjoyed that movie" Richard Denning's career began in 1937. He starred alongside Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and then became better known in television on the Hawaii Five-O series and in the series The Flying Doctor. Br /> <br /> Directed by Roger Corman, who has many films to his credit, both as director and producer. He has made some good movies and is still doing them. He became well known for his film direction of the Edgar Allan Poe stories, often starring Vincent Price. He also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> <br /> September 10, 2007
