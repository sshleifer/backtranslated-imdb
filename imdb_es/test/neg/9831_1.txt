I do not know if I hate this movie as much as I did when I saw it two weeks ago, but if it is waiting for the events described in the box, forget it ... that would have been a good movie. The big descent that is described in the box is nothing compared to the descent to the absolute disadvantage that I took when watching this movie. If you've seen the HBO Taxi Confessions, this is the same, just fictional, and not even remotely that interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the short 20-minute run on Encore from time to time ... it's really worth seeing. I've never, ever, asked for my money back for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Bored, bored, bored. It offers a unique feature, which is the following: it lets you decide what happens with each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill the gaps. Which would be great, if you really cared about any of these people. Instead I found myself screaming on the screen, crying like a child, praying for the end of the movie or for my own death. The taxi driver himself (although well played, considering) runs through seemingly random emotions, from the sarcastic to the sympathetic to the rabid and the apathetic to the apathetic. Sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it is just an exhibition for its own sake. "Damn, I learned all these emotions in the acting class, and I'm going to use them!" Now that I've been thinking about it again, I hate this movie as much as I did!
