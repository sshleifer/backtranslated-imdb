I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and almost always laughed at the horse scene. I should have realized that the movie was as empty as ... I can not find a good comparison. It's stupid and not even really fun. The original cast members who chose not to star in this probably took the best decisions they made to reject this; Why, oh why, did Chevy Chase come back? And how the hell did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this swell ?! I bet that every person who had his name, even remotely linked to this crap (for example, the provider) is ashamed beyond redemption. So, in general, it's beyond terrible, terrible and all that. Avoid it as you would with the Ebola virus.
