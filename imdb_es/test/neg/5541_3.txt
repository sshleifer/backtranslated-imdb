I realize that it is a small statistical sample (8 votes as of this publication), but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie a 3 and even that is generous. I've tried to watch this movie three times (Saturday night, at 9 pm, premiere on SciFi Channel, and Saturday night, at 1 pm and Thursday night, again) and I've He fell asleep three times before the movie ends. Which leaves me with a long list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen who runs out of money for having to continue playing secondary roles in these terrible sequels of "Pumpkinhead"? Is Henriksen prohibited from contracting films other than "Pumpkinhead"? Can not the creators of this franchise do something better than a monster that looks like a geriatric and emaciated "Alien" who walks like he has a stick stuck in his **? When will the characters in these movies realize that pistols and rifles do not harm the "Pumpkinhead"? Why do not you try to jam another stick up this is a ** instead? And finally, are the writers of this film such a creative challenge that they can not find names for the two original enemy families more than the Hatfields and the McCoys? While you're at it, why not write a script about a fictional president and call him George Bush? Someday I could have the mental stamina to see this movie until the end without falling asleep. Until then, if anyone has the answers, let me know.
