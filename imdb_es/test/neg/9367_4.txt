I have awarded this presentation with 4 stars. All of them are for the script, which has been massacred beyond recognition in some places. What can you say? They took one of the best works written in the last century and methodically stole his heart, his humor and his humanity. I really do not blame the actors, who are probably doing everything possible with a poor quality direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their inside, and their ideas, ripped out). I blame the director, who seems to struggle to find ways to undermine the script. There are so many uncomfortable pauses, awkwardly reconsidered moments and readings of lines rethought uncomfortably in this television movie that, at times, I forgot to have loved the work. I am not one of these people who think that works of genius are automatically inferior in the film (quite the opposite), but this work of genius in particular has been tremendously poorly served by this output. Now I hope you make a * real * movie of this work. The world deserves it.
