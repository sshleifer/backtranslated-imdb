Of course, all this nonsense raises the question "Does a genre as self-referential as teen comedy really needs another parody movie?" The unfortunate 'Scary Movie' (I and II) took the formula as far as it could: "It's not another teen movie" does not really have anything smart or surprisingly excessive to add. <br /> <br /> The plot, essentially based on the teenage fairy "She's All That", traces a trembling line between the parody and the tribute ("John Hughes High School"). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is extracted for references. The result is, ultimately, an unsatisfactory viewer experience. The disadvantage of giving us a copy diagram of "She's All That" is that we all know where we are going. And if we did not, then the jokes would not make sense. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The token-out-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems out of place here among all the "feel good" references. There are moments of humor: the song is funny enough and the strange line is to send the audience. It stinks, do not look at it.
