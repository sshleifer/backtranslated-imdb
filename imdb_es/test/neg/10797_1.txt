It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hiding under the shadow of his rather successful brother and that he appears in really bad movies. Joe spends most of his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite capricious. Receive orders from an angel of death with a swollen face, whom you might recognize as the villain with the swollen face of Tango & Cash and as the bloated face cyborg of the Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves bringing some souls of some children in a big car driven by a silly gallop that questions Led Zeppelin. Well, the car crashes and the chase is underway. The lucky kids who escaped from Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They chase them through the city, break things and Tonya is molested by her mother while she undresses to take a bath. The action ends in a hospital where we learn that the sky is an elevator ride away. In the end, some green lights flicker, Joe screams and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Look at it from the relative safety of MST.
