Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was badly written. First of all, during the kidnapping scene, Irons sits too comfortably in his chair ... he seems to be READING something, and quite calmly too! Maybe the director shot the actor between shots? In addition, the violence in the kidnapping was a great disappointment. In slow motion, shooting bullets: how his wife and daughter are killed is not so interesting and the tension is lost. His duel after he wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his friends and ambassadors of the journalism industry (he is a journalist for The Economist rag) and, in fact, give him advice on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me turn off the movie halfway was when Irons finds his way into a warehouse where the bad guys are hanging, BUT NOT THE BAD ones who KILL HIS WIFE, and destroys them anyway. so it's just a killer. He runs away and, well ... I turn it off. I mean I could not understand how his friends knew anything, and I also thought he was behind the 2 remaining guys in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead, he's chasing his friends, I suppose, or anyone who spends time in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons. The suspense was totally conventional and the dialogue was lame ("It's okay, crying help," he says to his son.) The son says "no, he does not" and the father says "You're right ... he does not. ") Irons assumes questionable roles, like that dragon movie he made. It was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal to this warm thriller.
