It is almost certain that he mounted a montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and undressing (not very briefly) in front of an anonymous (and uncredited) panel, almost certainly including producer Charles Band. Random scenes are released from many Surrender Cinema films (mainly lesbian scenes). Most women like to "ride a horse" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a secret; The camera that films the actresses stripping behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (very invented but still beautiful) presents a couple of scenes from her own movie and speaks in a 'sexy' way to the camera (if you like lesbian scenes, it includes Lovell and Vanessa Taylor from Femalian and they are probably the most attractive lesbian "couples" in history). Strange excuse for a movie and apart from the obvious draw of nude women, a frankly boring and boring experience.
