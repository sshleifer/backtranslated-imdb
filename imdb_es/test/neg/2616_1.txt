Very disappointing 7th chapter of this series that dies slowly. Very evident that the budget was extremely low. This movie was made for a reason and a single reason. To sell Puppet Master Toys! Fans, like myself in the series, have decided, so I've read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is Curse of the Puppetmaster. In turn, we move away from the series. <br /> <br /> Opting to make this a PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, did not work in favor of the movies. The plot seemed almost to be there, but it was easily lost in the constant stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only movie in the series that is worth seeing, also directed by Decoteau is part 3: Toulon's Revenge. <br /> <br /> Of course, I prefer the setting of the movie. <br /> <br /> How disgusting!
