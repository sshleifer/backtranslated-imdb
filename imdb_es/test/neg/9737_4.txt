For me this movie was a disappointment. Somehow, he hoped that would explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in World War II. But there's nothing like that, it's about the last year or two of his life and he tries, somehow, to whitewash it. So I just have to assume that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the business of conquest and murder, without any particular charm or notoriety in behavior. Such real-life people just do not make good film material. I almost feel sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to pose as a wooden character. Actually, was a good director and a great interpretive talent wasted in this movie? with the exception of Luther Adler, who presents a really memorable and strangely naturalistic portrait of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> There may also be a cultural problem for people like me, who are part of the German-speaking world. The famous British actors posing as Germans are simply not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not only as a German but as a typical "southerner" from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of ingenuity, a certain way of seeing the world (the total opposite of, for example, a Prussian junker.)) I also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt on July 20, many of those who participated in the conspiracy were not democrats and only wanted the German troops to join the Western allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best cinematographic representation of an intellectual and intellectual mentality is still Patton (1970) .By the way, General Patton can be glimpsed for a brief moment in the broad documentary base used for this film, a low-angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles, the open cover and the revolver with the mother-of-pearl handles are clearly visible!
