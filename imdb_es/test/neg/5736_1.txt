I know many people would claim certain movies as "the worst of all time", but I think Redneck claims this prize. A combination of the rather terrible performance of Mark Lester and Telly Savales and the progression of the plot that challenges the belief. <br /> <br /> At Telly Saveles: Was he drunk when he acted on this? It seems he plays a laughing lunatic, without a sense of conviction. Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I do not know. <br /> <br /> In Mark Lester: A more wooden performance than in a carpenter's workshop. His trim British tones do not belong to this film; and his transformation from protected teenager to gangster apprentice in 24 hours is crazy. And the scene of the strip with Mosquito has no relevance to the plot at all; Maybe the director likes this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Logic of the plot: when Memphis and Mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why does not Mark Lester's mother say anything to get his son out of the car? , before the crazy people take it? She just lets everyone go, without saying a word! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen, you will not believe how bad it is otherwise!
