This film is about a man who likes to blow himself in gasoline containers. <br /> <br /> He also loves his mom. Then, to keep the incoming money, he takes his performance to Broadway. <br /> <br /> SEE! CODY POWERS JARRETT DROUGHT TO ITS LARGEST GAS CONTAINER! TONIGHT! 7.30PM! <br /> <br /> However, one day, his mom dies and Jarrett goes crazy. He kidnaps the public in the theater and makes them stand on a huge gas cylinder. <br /> <br /> Losing even more control, makes them scream "MADE MA, UP CYLINDER!" in unison <br /> <br /> The noise is so deafening that it pops Jarrets' eardrums, causing him to fall from the cylinder into an acid tank. <br /> <br /> This Warner Bros. movie is not all that is as good as it looks.
