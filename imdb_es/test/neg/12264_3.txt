This movie follows a storyboard very similar to The Warriors, but with less intensity and a very poor performance that is nothing special. <br /> <br /> The story in general is not so bad, based on a small Australian gang. They are trying to leave the city when one of their members is framed by the rape of the girl from another gang. Then they have to fight their way through the streets while being chased by rival gangs. On could assume that the writers took a page from The Warriors' book and rewrote it, but as mentioned above, with less intensity. <br /> <br /> The performance as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it is clearly obvious that on many occasions they are acting ... however, the fight scenes compensate for this, but then the bad effects of The sound that accompanies them returns it. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good history, bad performance, nothing great.
