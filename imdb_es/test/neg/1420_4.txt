An interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations that surround Jay Leno in replacement of Carson as host of the Tonight Show. The film is currently very current, given the public drama surrounding Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of arousing the interest of viewers in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly the executives of NBC. Ovitz's portrait was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> Even so, many of the characters were limited or touched very briefly, and some of the acts seemed superficial. However, an interesting story.
