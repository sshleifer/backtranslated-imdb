I'm surprised that nobody likes this movie. I never leave the movies, but my friend had to physically prevent me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. The white characters are saints and the Asian characters are practically nonexistent and are worthless for the story. they only exist as objects, surprise. The characters of other races are doing much better. The twists and turns were laughable and predictable. But if you are reading this, you already know. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can not even make multicultural films. Do yourself a favor and observe a much more honest view of race relations, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!
