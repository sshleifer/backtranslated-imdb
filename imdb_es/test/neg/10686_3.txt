The scenes of eating animals (geek) were not as bad as you might think. After having seen Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are normal. The most rude was when the boy ate the mouse's head. But they were so quick and few that they did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was interesting. I always like to hear silly voices. They never sound like what you think the actor / actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors used by the princesses. The pictures of bizarre looking bugs were also great. The younger princess looked REALLY young, almost 14 or so. The fight scenes were not as long and boring as most of the fight scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
