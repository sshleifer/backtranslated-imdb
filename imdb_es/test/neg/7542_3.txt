Apart from the fact that this movie was made (I guess I thought it was a good idea at that time, since BOTTOM was so popular), what puzzled me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was what happened with the lighting? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this movie, and I saw it on a television network, so it was not a case of seeing a dirty tape. In fact, the film was filmed so darkly that it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if the dialogue was something to go for that maybe it's not a bad thing
