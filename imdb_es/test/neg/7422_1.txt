(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Not redeemable, without merit and, above all, tragic trash. You know that a movie is going to be bad when its only star power is Lance Henriksen. The French title of this film says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you make such an incredibly bad movie these days? Whatever the trick of Jonas Quastel, it worked. This is a "trash", I'm talking about "hands" at the level of shit, meaningless, you can not see, not even so bad, it's good, the cinematic bile of the highest level. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen IS Harlan Knowles, a character who might have been interesting if he was not so devoid of character or personality. He, along with a group of idiots, goes hiking to look for an evil Sasquatch that is believed to have attacked a plane that crashed into the forest, or something like that. It does not happen much more. There are some soft nudity (which means: level of Teletubbie) and some flagrant deceptions of "Predator". After 92 minutes of total pain and another scene ripped out, this time from "Blair Witch", the film finally wobbles on the finish line and ends. As an added benefit, we only see the monster for one or two scenes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is that this is a very bad movie and it's not worth seeing as a movie "so bad, it's good". "The Untold" is to value what Orlando Bloom is for the performance of the characters. Avoid it like arsenic.
