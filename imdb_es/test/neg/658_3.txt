Compared to the recent Gore movie, HOSTEL, in which this film reminded me a lot: I would say that See No Evil is a bit better, but not much. The very complex plot involves a handful of criminals who are sent to clean a ruined hotel for a shorter jail sentence. The children soon end up being killed by a religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I suppose). What he feared most before seeing this was the fact that it was a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had two lines of a word in the movie. There are a couple of pretty bloody moments, mainly related to visual excitement and a very memorable scene in which a girl is pushed by a cell phone down her throat, probably the most effective disappearance of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this movie really shows us something new and, definitely, it is far from being great. I can not recommend it.
