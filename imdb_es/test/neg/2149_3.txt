Hell to Pay was a disappointment. He did not have the essence of a B Western movie at all, and it should not be compared to a fantastic movie like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was awkward, the soundtrack was unnecessary and the performance was horrible. Even the professionals could have taken some lessons from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it showed some of the best cowboy shooters in the nation, but you can see them in a better way in any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very attractive, and the preview is decent, but after that everything is over.
