All Dogs go to Heaven was a peculiar and funny movie; With the talent of a good name whose voices lent an adult familiarity to a caricature basically for children. It was simply interesting enough for the adults to sympathize with something good for the children to see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel that tries to make some cash in the first pants. Charlie Sheen is a passable substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second film and the voice of Sheena Easton in some of the lovely but forgettable films that make her a chosen co-star for this. Add to Dom DeLuise the first movie and you would think that this would be a decent combination to make this sequel relatively decent compared to the first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good voice actors like Bebe Neuwirth in the horrible role of Anabelle, this film can not be saved from the atrocious production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof). of them) present throughout the film. Horrible editing, synchronization of voices and flat spaces in which the characters must move to dialouge but do not combine to make this film look like an animation project of university interns instead of the decent sequel that could have been. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that unless you were a big fan of the first movie, I would give this one a very large PASS.
