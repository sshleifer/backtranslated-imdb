This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visual and did not do much with the game, which is the most important part. I mean, the images look amazing, but is the game really "fun"? DO NOT! I mean it's like "hey we skip buildings" and all I'm doing is put up with A / X. The game is just not there, and I do not agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like "OK, we have this hot girl, let's look at her" and if you go to the game websites, you will not see game elements of Assassin's Creed, you will see her face with a microphone and it will be like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!" It's like man, close the F * @ K UP WHO DOES IT MATTER? Apparently ... a lot of people do it, because they bought the game and they like it ... I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not really abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and offers the most important thing, GAME! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still amazing, the music in the game was orchestrated and it sounded incredible, and THAT is a game that deserves the game of the year. NO Assassin's Creed, man, does not even deserve to be a NOMINATED for the Game of the Year. The exaggeration around this game where it was like "oh, it's the next generation of games" ... really? I do not think so! So let me clarify this, because I think that people who like this game only like it because they are Jade fans, so I will tell you, JADE WILL NOT HAVE WITH US NOR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND GAME! If you want a REAL game on the PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a lot of other games too), and if you just want a REAL game, at all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know that this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, by pressing two buttons to do all these cool things, is it REALLY a fun game? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because later it will be more innovative and fun. And this game simply is not. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 A LIVING HELL!
