I have never been disappointed in a Kurosawa movie, but this is probably the first one. "Doppelganger" is the worst I've seen of this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films announces this as "The most terrifying film of Kiyoshi Kurosawa". What? Kurosawa's most terrifying movie is definitely "Kairo". And if you think this is horror, a surprise awaits you. This can not be classified as horror, or thriller. This is a drama, and quite bad at that. Many scenes that had to be shocking turned out to be fun, and much of the plot is really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But he is so slow that he will lose interest in forty minutes and will want to do something else. What bothered me the most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if it runs with little care ... it can be a disaster. I think that describes a scene here that has a minimal use of CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give to "Dopppelganger" is that it has a very good performance. Koji Yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. But that's it ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and go see "Kairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be afraid. This is a bad, bad attempt at an intelligent drama. Which is smart, but ... Well, a lot is missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good acting.
