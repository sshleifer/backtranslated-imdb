Romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for "lower than normal" films and a source of frustration for viewers. This is a perfect example of this and I got a place in my "ten worst movies". <br /> <br /> The story is far from being creative and the jokes are weak. I did not find any reason for a single laugh during the whole movie! The characters are simple and the performance of the actors and simply good. The story develops slowly, it is tedious and predictable. The end is also predictable and is coated with sugar. <br /> <br /> This is a video that you see on a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to see in my humble opinion.
