I can not believe I really sat through this whole movie. A friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good. In his defense, the jacket was correct; there was a supposedly haunted room in which someone slept during the night. From the jacket, it looked like this was on par with Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining." It could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surrealist movies, you can enjoy it. If you're looking for a good horror movie, or a couple of emotions, rent Jason vs Freddy IV, you'll have a much better night.
