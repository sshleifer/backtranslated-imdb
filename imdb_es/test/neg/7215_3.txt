Last night I saw a promotion of this movie on Spike's channel, it was grouped with a repeat of Patrick Swazy from another movie he made and he thought that Swazy was in this sequel ... boy, I was wrong ... I see. The scriptwriter also starred in it, and I think the budget was a bit tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the movie that has much better credit to his name for playing in a "c" movie like this one. Bussey jr struggled to represent the image of his father (one of the best bad actors of all time) that failed miserably, the only redeeming qualities of the film were the girls, beautiful and with a lot of T & A. It's worth the time or your dollar earned to rent it
