Blackwater Valley Exorcism is located on a ranch in a small town where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is roaming covered in dog blood. His parents Ely (Randy Colton) and Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are deeply concerned about their daughter, recently she has not been herself and considers herself a danger to herself and others. The hand of the ranch and former priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognizes the symptoms of Isabelle as a possible case of possession and when he begins to speak ancient Latin with a strange voice, he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls the priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), who is the ex-husband of his other daughter, Claire (Madison Taylor), to see Isabelle, confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the work of performing the exorcism that, with luck, will banish the demon that is inside Isabelle and an innocent girl. .. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ethan Wiley I sat there in my house, in front of my TV, watching the exorcism of Blackwater Valley, and repeated the same question again and again, why do I do it? Why do I keep seeing all these horrible low-budget horror movies that seem to have been filmed on a camcorder? The truth is that the Exorcism of Blackwater Valley is a total and total scam without shame of The Exorcist (1973) and literally marks the main points of the plot that the two share. There is the possessed adolescent who begins to get very horny and suggest inappropriate things, the demon who uses the faults of the past against others, concerned parents, the way in which the possessed child is rejected by the doctor, the priest with a problematic past and the possessed girl is tied to her bed among other things. I guess where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (apart from its total shit) is that it tries to give screen time to all the characters and tries to explain how the situation is affecting them, but it is so badly written and acted that it just ends up being. boring. The film begins with Isabelle who was already possessed, so we never knew how she was like a normal person, so we never worry about her or what is happening to her, the rest of the characters are badly written and they are very complete . Sometimes I wondered if the Blackwater Valley exorcism was a parody, there is a silly scene in which a veterinarian tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilizers and after he says he needs a "little pinch", enters his room with a huge hidden needle. Behind his back! There are some scenes in which people are beaten accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven tone as a result, since it goes between a silly parody and a serious horror drama, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to a text before the opening credits, the exorcism of Blackwater Valley was based on 'Actual Events', yes, real events of 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist ... This text also states that the scenes of exorcism were supervised by a true priest. There is not even gore or decent exploitation to animate things, there is a scene of a cut arm, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and that's it. Surprisingly, there is no bad language in it, even though the demon tries to be offended. I imagine that the only reason that Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of a very short scene in which you see a pair of breasts. A pair of naked female breasts is not worth looking at this or the money you could spend on it. There is no fear, no atmosphere, and a feeling really fond of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 1,000,000, I must say that I wonder where all the money went, the movie looks ugly. and cheap in everything. There are no special effects to talk about and production values ​​are minimal. The performance is very poor of all involved, the favorite of the genre Jeffrey Combs is approaching the maximum turnover during the opening credits, but has only a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. He must have even feared how bad it was going to be if he hides behind a mustache and a terrible accent, it's better than this. <br /> <br /> The exorcism of Blackwater Valley is a total exorcist scam without everything that made that movie a classic and the creators arrive thirty-five years too late. A total turkey from start to finish.
