Do not waste your time. One of those cool-looking boxes you pick up at Blockbuster on a hunch, but it's not even worth it. You will not say: "It's so bad, it's good." Simply, "it's bad". The Greatest American Hero is a writer who rents a cabin on an African island, called Snake Island. Some other tourists are in the boat that leaves it, but they do not stay on the island. They just stop there to let the writer go. Then, the boat is stranded there and, in the true originality of Hollywood, the only radio on the island is collapsed. Then they start walking and see a lot of snakes. Like hundreds of them, it really became annoying and you knew that the plot would not go anywhere. It's not as if there ever was ONE main serpent. Like a mutated giant serpent or a poisonous king extra from all snakes. Instead, there are only a lot of snakes of all kinds of breeds. His only goal, then, was to escape the island ... instead of having to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew that they could not possibly try to kill them all, and they did not try. I've seen a similar movie in which a city was obsessed with snakes and they lead all the snakes to a cave and then they blow it up. At least then you have the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. In Snake Island (by the way, all the characters were surprised to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, it's called NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no other plan than trying to get gas for the stupid boat. Oh, they never get gas by the way. They "just happen" to find another boat on the island that has been gassed.
