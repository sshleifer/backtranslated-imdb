This movie is one of the worst movies of all time. I'm a little upset because this movie is not in the last 100; deserves a place at least number 60 or 70 on that list. This is not just a movie that I think is bad in a country style of MST3K; It's just bad. This is one of the few movies that I really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same bad category. <br /> <br /> So the history of this story says that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and returns with Crawl (Shore) and tries to learn to be a farmer. Then, the boyfriend tries to install Shore so that the girl leaves the Crawl and returns with him. It ends and what remains of the audience can go. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to take a camera and try to be fun; but I would say that about 100% of the time fails in that. His horrible inaccurate and outdated view of farms and agriculture is offensive and there is nothing in this film worth seeing. If you think about seeing it: do not do it. The only time I saw the movie I felt I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If you have already seen it; you have my sympathy
