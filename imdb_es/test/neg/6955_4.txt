A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written and it's fine, but it's really a mess, it's not funny or scary enough. It's a modern and flaccid cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise: that even in the refracted moral interior of East London, people do things for the right reasons. A surprising result of the first proper fight, the old school of Caine, Billy Shiner, has inflamed his paranoia. The second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the result of the first. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was that director John Irvin could not do more than the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant / subsidiary of frank harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well, while those around him seem to have ignored him. Pity. 4/10
