Bad news for anyone who wants to film a full parody of a Lifetime Network movie. The creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done so, albeit unintentionally. All the tropes of all life are there: a divorced mother in danger of a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that blatantly condemns her grievances, forcing her Stand up for yourself. Especially amazing is the scene in which the heroine, after suffering a robbery and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve stress by shopping. Having seen firsthand the harassment of a co-worker by a mistake he met in the church, I know that harassment is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.
