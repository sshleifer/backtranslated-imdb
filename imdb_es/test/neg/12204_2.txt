Did someone find the plot somewhere in the movie? Perhaps it is what is lacking in this pretentious exercise of film about cinema. It is quite surprising that Gordon says that "a movie without an argument is nothing" ... It is possible that the characters have more to say than Wim Wenders himself. Was this phrase in the original plot or did the actor decide to send a clue to the director?
