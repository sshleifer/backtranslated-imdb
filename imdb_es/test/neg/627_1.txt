Beautiful, stereotyped, with a good cast, the story takes place in a wide and confusing arc, guiding you through a series of garden paths (without fairies) before plummeting towards an end that makes you leave: empty. > If you are looking for a movie that has a climax or that ends with a satisfying stroke, this is going to be a disappointment. Despite the notoriously overt sexuality of the main character, I felt he was androgynous, lacking a clear male persona, rather as his lack of a clear French person. Even though he is naked (or, rather, sitting naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unconscious as the character in terms of motivations, that little thing called argument. Probably a stereotypical English-speaking point of view, at least if you side with the movie.
