and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a bathing suit is one of them. To the fans of this film, I would like to ask: Would you allow your daughter to walk through a tourist center dressed like that? And could your 14-year-old daughter handle the reaction she would get from men? If yes, I would like to know why, in both cases. A suit like that is a clear invitation to men; It is hypocritical to suggest that it is not so. <br /> <br /> And at another point, what teenager would ever say that his father was his mistress, without the excuse of serious mental problems? That's almost as disgusting as the bathing suit. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, some things are simply not fun or appropriate, and never will be.
