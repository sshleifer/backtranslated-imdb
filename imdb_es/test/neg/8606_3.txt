Have you ever seen something so horrible that you have to keep looking to make sure it really is as bad as it seems? This is one of those movies. It was criticized by critics at its launch, not just because of the way it was funded. Last night I caught it on television and I gave myself up to curiosity. <br /> <br /> In the event, it is what it says in the box, neither more nor less: low level humor, harshness, much in the 'Continue ... Vena but with "adult" language. In fact, it goes back to the porn industry of the 60s and 70s in the UK, cheating punters by promising them real sex and not fulfilling (detecting the nipple?) The whole age of bad taste is recreated here with love, but with modern cinematography. <br /> <br /> Has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and also Johnny Vegas. The girl in the chip store is genuinely sexy. Beyond these unexpected positives, it leaves me wondering what happened to England. Junk food, poorly paid jobs, farms, desperate lives. As an added benefit, there are some good pictures of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners can find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. In general, however, I still feel incredulous that I sat through it.
