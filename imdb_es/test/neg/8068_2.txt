so if a boy meets you and says "I want you to look at my erection!" Do not be alarmed, maybe you want to see the movie he made about how his house would be built. yes! That's the only thing that happens in this movie! It's like Warhol's worst BEEP I've seen! It's like filming the inside of your toilet before you throw it away, in fact, it's less interesting to watch than that. <br /> <br /> but if you look at Lennon's Erection, keep in mind that he put a lot of background. the noise in him too. I mean, really, it's like the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something! meanwhile, the building in progress is growing as an erection can do (in almost 20 minutes, what an achievement). <br /> <br /> So if someone asks you to monitor them, make sure you want to record everything.
