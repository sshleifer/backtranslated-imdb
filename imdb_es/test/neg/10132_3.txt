Natalie Wood plays Courtney Patterson, a disabled polio songwriter who tries to avoid falling victim to her first love affair, with fellow lawyer Marcus Simon, played timidly by Wood's real-life husband, Robert Wagner. The film is very cropped, but most of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand of the director that allows Wagner to be continuously somnambulist, which wears out a solid and nuanced performance by Wood, who also offers a good soprano. The script is somewhat trivial, but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic deficiency is, unfortunately, in its place, since he is given a free hand to impose his lost gaze on Wood, which must be discouraging for an actress. The progression of their relationship is presented erratically and this, along with choppy editing, leads the viewer to not being sure of what is happening, and the motivation is almost completely ignored in the writing. Although it is largely indistinguishable, the cinematography shines during a brief scene when Wood is placed in a courtyard and, after the sound of a closing door, remains in the center while the camera moves away constantly demonstrating its impotence and fragility. A more controlled direction would have allowed artists, including the Wagner cushion, to scale their performance along the lines of an engaging relationship; As it was published, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.
