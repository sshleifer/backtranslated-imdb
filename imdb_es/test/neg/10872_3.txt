I've had more boring 80-minute stretches in my life, but none comes to mind at this time. Hell Ride is based on the retro 70s cult theme that Tarantino brought and did well in films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is that, unlike PF and RD, the story is trash and so is the development of the character. How many movies does Bishop think he can steal shamelessly? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the compressed air gun in No Country, etc., etc. Speaking of Bishop, what the hell are you doing acting in this movie? I could not help but laugh at those scenes in which he was standing with his confident pelvis, desperately trying to look like a hardened cyclist. Nothing in this movie is credible. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really need the Easy Rider motif too? I blame Larry Bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the lead role. Do not bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
