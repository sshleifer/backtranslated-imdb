I was not making big assumptions about the fact that this was surely a very, very free adaptation of the work of Eça de Queiroz, and I must say that this free adaptation forms the book as many possible good ideas and characters. The problem is the way it is done, without any care, without taste, just a cliché noise of bad taste everywhere. The script is so fake and the characters so unreal that they make the nice little actors to see Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others, get lost in a network of things other than film or storytelling. To my surprise, the newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves boldly dare to their performances, but they can be seen as lost as a boat adrift without any direction. And speaking of direction, this seems to be something totally missing in this film, where is the Director? Everything is bad taste; The frames are whatever, and whenever, the use of the handheld camera without any justified reason, the light design that must create environments does not exist (and there are no excuses that the main point is a dark real story). The general problem in this movie "trying to be" is that it has no taste, or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see Jorge and Soraia melting into these false and gratuitous sex scenes, painted here and there through the film as the closing of narrative holes or as false reasons for transition. Maybe Carlos Coelho da Silva should see Carlos Carrera's 2002 adaptation of the same Eça book and learn how to build a real movie.
