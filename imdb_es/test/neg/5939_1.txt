If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the most pretentious movie made anywhere in the world, I'm convinced. A son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. They love each other, I suppose. No, they do not, I'm sure. These are not characters. They are not even actors playing characters. At least it could be pretty, but even nature seems ridiculously retouched and changed where necessary with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have devised a technique as trite as a ration of distorted aspect? You should have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.
