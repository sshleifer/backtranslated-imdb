Honestly, the only reason I chose this Blockbuster movie was because Aaron Carter was in it. Well, first things first. Do you realize how ugly Aaron Carter has become? I mean, he used to be so cute, but now ... with that ungainly body and smeared skin - EW. I think I should keep singing and the directors of the movie could have found a much better guy who could synchronize their lips. However, do not be offended. I thought that this movie for teenagers was pretty bad and this comes from me, being also a teenager. The "bad girls" are very predictable, the acting is so amateurish that it makes you tremble sometimes (especially Aaron) and, in general, I did not enjoy it. Although, I give points for the plot, that was fine, but it was not realistic at all. Anyway, stay away from this movie by all means you can, unless you have a lot of cash on hand and have nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. It's not worth it for the $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S. This review by me may not apply to children under 13!)
