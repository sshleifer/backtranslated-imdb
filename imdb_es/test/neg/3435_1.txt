Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie in the cinema. But I missed it, and then I forgot it. Oh boy, I'm glad this movie did not ruin my teenage eyes back then. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday, and seriously, it must be among the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that have had too much attention, like those wonderful advances in television, and too much money spent on actors and in the making of the film. <br /> <br /> The script sucks and the performance sucks even worse, do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD!
