I would like you to just make a special section in video rental stores for movies like this one. The section would read: "Movies for lonely older men who like to see young girls being naughty and wearing fetish clothes". I suppose Dominique Swain, after Lolita and now this, is establishing herself as the queen of the dirty old man's genre.
