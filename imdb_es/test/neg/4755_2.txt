Actually, I do not understand how that movie could get a rating higher than 4 here in IMDb. It's just a big mess, and I must admit that I really liked AvP 1: I have almost no history, I can live with that, but at least they got to the point almost at the same time. AvP 2 does not do it. After the stupid premise has been presented, there are more than half an hour of stupid teen clich√©s, silly dialogues and almost nothing else, except for some extraterrestrial scenes that seem like an excuse to have the first half of the movie. and the Predator scenes that make you wonder if those guys who made the movie saw any other Predator movie or just did not care enough to bother you. <br /> <br /> After that, that crap-fest finally reaches the point where the Predator begins to attack the Aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And boy, is that stupid predator, blind and deaf. It is awful. How he managed to win those things he has surpasses me. Fail with almost all the shots, just note to Aliens when they are directly in your face or if it is absolutely necessary for the script, so you can move where you need to be. He even lets himself be surprised by small and human teenagers and deputies all the time. What is that guy supposed to be? After the first hour of that abomination, he shook his head more or less constantly in each scene. Almost no scene in this movie happens without incredibly stupid dialogues, stupid Predator actions or stupid shortcomings or stupid actions of our "heroes". <br /> <br /> Then, that finally ended. To my surprise, not only me and my friends did not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard when they left the room were half crying, half laughing at those 1 and a half hours they had lost. <br /> <br /> Do not look. Never.
