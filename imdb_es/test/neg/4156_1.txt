Many times the description "full of sound and fury that means nothing" is used and is correct. Unfortunately "Code 46" lacks sound and fury. A little rage would have been much appreciated. The character of Tim Robbins (William) lacks so much passion that the idea of ​​instantly falling in love with Maria (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so dispassionate that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been administered with torazina. There is a type of atmosphere "Brave New World" in the film that receives help throughout each scene that takes about 2-3 overexposed stops. Unfortunately, this technique becomes tedious and quite hard on the eyes. The pettiness of tongues also becomes tedious when it seems that there is no apparent reason for their existence. Many futuristic science fiction films are criticized for being all flash and without substance. This movie has neither flash nor substance. It's a 6 code all the way.
