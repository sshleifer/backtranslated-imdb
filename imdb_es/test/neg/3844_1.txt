Obviously, the previous comments on the subject of the film were made by someone who is on the team. I do not remember ever seeing a movie that is more insulting to talented actors or the audience. In my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one I've come out of. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the producer: It is never fun to hunt humans based on race. It's great that you've tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's disgusting.
