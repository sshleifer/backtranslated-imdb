Marlene Dietrich is magnificent as Concha Pérez, the temptress who leads all men to despair in "El diablo es una mujer" by Josef Von Sternberg. His performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but it is incandescent, a true star that totally controls his material. But she's the only good thing about the movie, (it's so good that it keeps you watching this scum, I doubt another actress could have done the same thing). <br /> <br /> The story is a terribly scarce melodrama. (probably Pierre Louys' novel was better), in which Dietrich's amoral Conch ruined the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and César Romero with a rigidity that borders on petrifaction. And for Von Sternberg it's an ugly-looking movie, (maybe according to its rather ugly theme). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough to remake it as "That Obscure Object of Desire", with a greater emphasis on the surreal aspects of everything, up to the performance of two different actresses in the same role. Neither of the two films is the director's best hour and, while Bunuel's version may be the best, it is Dietrich's "performance" that you remember.
