I will never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it destroys it when it takes it to the screen. The first thing I thought about seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were the protagonists that I would see something from MGM that made the best musicals at that moment. Boy was wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, starring Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, performed 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway. interprets the roles played by Martin, Baker and Boles on stage. The musical by Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash with a book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a return vehicle for Mary Martin, who reestablished herself as the Queen of Broadway after a disappointing adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that entered this show. Considering who was responsible for the book, I expected to see some brilliant ingenuity in this production. Instead, I got a pretty pedestrian script, it was as if all the ingenuity had been drained. Eve Arden plays her usual Friday role with the Tom Conway girls, but it's too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story is about Robert Walker, the department store dresser who kisses a valuable statue of Venus that comes to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue disappears, Conway shouts by the law and suspects Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Walker dealing with Gardner and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I do not understand, Ava was nicknamed by Eileen Wilson and Walker just sings a couple of lines. Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan interpret the song interpreting Walker's friends and coworkers. Of course, on Broadway the songs were made by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. One would think that Haymes would be playing the role of Walker at least. It was uncomfortable to say the least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived the score, Do not look now, but My heart is showing, That's Him, and the incomparable Speak Low. The Hayes silk baritone is shown as the best advantage in Speak Low that was sung in duet by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason, the lyrics of one of the greatest verses of the last century, Ogden Nash, were finished by Ann Ronnell. I suspect that the infamous Code worked here. <br /> <br /> In Ava Gardner's biography of Lee Server, he mentions a brief affair that Ava had with Robert Walker when he had a dispute with his current man, Howard Duff. . When Duff and Gardner met, Walker took it badly and did not speak at all with Gardner off camera. I'm sure the fact that both were not at their best work did not help either. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that some repertoire company makes One Touch Of Venus and you can see it. This was written by Weill, Nash and Perelman.
