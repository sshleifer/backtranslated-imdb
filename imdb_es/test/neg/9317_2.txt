Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with boring and pedantic narratives. I reorganized a vacation to see this "world premiere". That mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an exorcist movie? Good intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babbling, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his youth days, is a potentially interesting topic. But an exorcist film needs more! The relentless presentation of draggy, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for an odd production. Who is this movie for? I did not bother to see Harlin's version, but at least apparently they tried to offer some kind of visceral emotion. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series has been quite strange. The first film was excellent, but all the sequels were not loved and lacked meaning. Why are you still doing them? I guess Schrader did it so he could make a lot of money. But why should we go?
