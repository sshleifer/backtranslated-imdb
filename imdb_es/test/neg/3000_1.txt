This is the most boring, pretentious and stupid movie I've seen in a long time. I saw him at the Academy in Beverly Hills, and there were a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and sought refuge there. They all shook their heads solemnly and seemed to have been at a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Worse still are the critics who gave good reviews to this pretentious airship. What's with them? Are they afraid that they will not be considered "at the hip"? Were they bribed? This movie is amazingly bad. Do not dedicate a date waiting for an in-depth conversation at the Cheesecake factory afterwards. If your idea was to go see this movie, she will surprise you and keep you on the rest of your life.
