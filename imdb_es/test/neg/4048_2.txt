When I saw this for the first time, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was "You get the 8MM camera, I'll get the monstrous toys from my little brother, we'll make a movie!" Why would someone in a modern era like 2001 make a science fiction movie like this, it seems that it was made in the early 80's? With actors who are as wooden as an Indian from a cigar store, a script written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, with special effects from the poverty line , and to top it off, A director who thought that doing this shit would make them famous. The final result was not spectacular, complete with little dialogue and continuity. Venus must have been fun to do, and I'm sure everyone involved had a great time with their silly little movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a brave and desperate effort. <br /> <br />
