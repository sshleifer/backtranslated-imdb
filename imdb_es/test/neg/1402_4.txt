I just finished seeing this horribly depressing drama and I realized that, in the light of recent dramas like these, the only ones that could be considered abnormal are the least aware that life is nothing but tragic. I would suggest how nauseatingly defeating and counterproductive this conclusion is, even if relationships and perspectives like those presented in this film are in fact founded to some extent. But, on the other hand, I realized that these films have made the great determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same families and dysfunctional and asphyxiating friendships continue to appear, they have simply been again and again. in some kind of attempt to eliminate previous distortions of family life (much of which existed in the 1950s and earlier, with very subtle personality and character aberrations), supplanting it instead with the "reality" of how they are really things. That, in fact, what we are seeing is no longer dysfunctional, but in fact, it is a normal existence and a set of circumstances that have really existed all the time, but of which we have previously been unconscious and, therefore, We have ignored or at least denied. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many movies have been trying to explain this point. And doing it almost identically. When I read the synopsis of the movie, I immediately thought of "Ice Storm". As I watched the depressing lack of life of the Travis family, which seemed to endure repeated emotional reprimands, I immediately remembered "American Beauty." And, in some ways, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, Tim, drew similarities in 'Igby Goes Down'. 'Imaginary heroes' can be a novel experience, perhaps refreshing for an honest portrait of the character who, as stated before, is often not allowed to exist in family movies (which is stupid to think anyway) , considering that we were already seeing these kinds of relationships shown in films like 'Common People' since 1980 and going back even further, but for the well-versed viewer, these films may not offer anything new. in a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to outdo each other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can include in a family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends) .In fact, 'Imaginary Heroes', the latest in this genre (I think there have been enough films to declare it accurately as 'genre'), it puts so many disasters and surprises in a single family, that they would make the prize awards for a talk show day is the story of a family proven by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hates sport with passion. The youngest son knew, the father was stunned and blinded by the impulse of his star son's competitiveness. And it is not clear that the mother and the sister had a very good relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's no less entertaining (to a certain extent, for those who find this material exhaustingly depressing after a while), and the performances are pretty good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But, undoubtedly, I hope that future filmmakers who wish to add comments to troubled family relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be suburban white families of upper middle class) intend to offer something new through material and knowledge. You should not see any distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.
