I can only name some movies that I've seen that were so bad. This film has everything terrible: the dialogue is corny and cliche, the performance is poor for the most part with some exceptions, cinematography is nothing to cheer and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because she daughter he did not make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's fun to watch it. If you can capture this for life, I highly recommend it as a comedy. As for being a serious movie, I'm afraid I'll have to classify this as a 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you're a movie fanatic and you're looking for an interesting and challenging story. , or acting. You can not find any. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people who work all their lives must have written some fake reviews and voted all the negatives. Do not believe them. This is a really horrible movie.
