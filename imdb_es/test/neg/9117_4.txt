The critics were like "a movie that will break your heart", etc. So a friend of mine and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I'll make it short and leave it. It is up to others to write about their content. This movie is about touching you, to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And also for my friend. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened happened only on the screen. It was always there, not here, where I am. I thought that most of the time "hmm, something is happening on the screen, but it's only on the screen, it's not real." <br /> <br /> Movies that were much more successful at touching me: East of Eden (1955), Terms of Endearment (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
