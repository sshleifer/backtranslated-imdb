I saw the unrated version of this film and, as a person who has studied the life and crimes of Speck closely, I must say that this film is a flawed but ambitious version of the real story. While capturing the true horror of Speck and the murders, this film makes the following errors in fact. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as shown in the movie. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and a pill addict who rarely took drugs with a syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived the Speck massacre did not wriggle down the stairs and under the sofa in the living room as shown in the movie. This would have been impossible. In real life, she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated her 8 victims. 3. The film shows Speck as violent and brutal with women as soon as he knows them. Is not true. Actually, at first, Speck was calm and gentle, reassuring the women that he would not hurt them. That was how he could bind each one of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the profound thinker that the film describes as it is. FBI profile Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 1980s and said that Speck not only did not know why he committed the murders but was not interested in knowing why he could not shed any light on why. It was known that Speck was less than average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this film. If the story were not so tragic and horrifying, the voiceover would be laughable. In general, Doug Cole's performance is sufficiently threatening and cold-blooded, although I do not believe that the real Speck was so direct in his violence. Undoubtedly, he was a very violent person when he was under the influence, but he was also known, after all, for being a very clever swindler who was able to reassure people before victimizing them. The performance of Beverly Ann Sotelo as the surviving nurse is the best in the film. She is a very good actress. If you're a little apprehensive, do not watch this movie. It is very graphic and disturbing.
