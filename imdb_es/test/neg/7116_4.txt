Mr. Brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same one that produced the TV series Dragonball Z. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a real action movie from Hong Kong based on the first episodes of the original Japanese cartoon (which was also based on a series of comics). And I really do not know if it was produced under the license of the creators of Dragonball ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of the monkey-child with special powers is an ancient tale known throughout Asia (in Japan, the name of the child in the story is Songoku, in China it is Sunwukong, in Korea it is Sonogong, etc.) and the story in Dragonball has a lot to do with that story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version had a different broadcast order) . And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without too much exaggeration and so much insistence on it!), But due to their comments, I suppose they were completely eliminated in the American dub. <br /> Anyway, I agree with you about the excess of acting in the movie and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is. But maybe that's why nobody can forget it after seeing it ...
