We are in the not too distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages ​​are mixed together (although English prevails over others), races have merged, human cloning is a fact and the whole territory seems have divided into two zones: the valid and the invalid ... a brave new world (in the style of Aldous Huxley) in which people are genetically archived and blood relations are strictly prohibited (for health reasons) That is Code 46 of the title-). In such an environment, two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important story, with great potential. A good recipe that he ruins giving it such a slow rhythm, narrating it in such a tired way, eliminating any emotion ... Coldness, that's all that Code 46 transmits. Coldness and boredom Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles beautifully), nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the film. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
