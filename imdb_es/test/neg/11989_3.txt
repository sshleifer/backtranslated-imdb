I am very concerned about some publications that I am reading on the message boards of this film. People say that it's really a good movie! The fact that this movie is the best to date of Uwe Boll does not make it a good movie, by no means in hell! Far Cry is a cliché full of bad acting, bad direction and an uninspired story with a bad script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news people, action movies are not very difficult to do because, for a basic action movie, all you need are explosions and battles of weapons scattered around a plot flimsy, and Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all the horror games adapted to Boll's films are much worse than this (they do not have redeeming qualities). Far Cry has two things that make it his best moment: two good prospects and a couple of well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female protagonist. The usually great Udo Kier is passable, since the cliché villain and the cast are pretty bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence that surprised considering that Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feeling, with a bad CGI, lame from a single line and clichés in every corner. Oh, and the worst thing that brings me to a sex scene, I think I've ever done it. Not only the two have known each other for only six hours, but all he needs is for him to say that he stayed warm while he was in the army spooning his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take off her clothes simply by telling her to do it. Then he took off and went to bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize, this is a bad movie. It's a mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're totally bored. You could probably do more than just put it in and watch it, but personally I would say watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and avoid this derived mess. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
