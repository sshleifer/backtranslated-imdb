It is sad to say that this is one of the most stupid of John Wayne's series of poverty westerns for Lone Star Productions. Here he is a marshal of the United States on the trail of a known bandit only, I'm not kidding, like the Shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's a guy who gives his orders through an open wall. Safe so that his men do not see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you'll know it within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another critic here is quite wrong, there have been no cries or snarls from the audience because Gabby Hayes was still playing a variety of roles and is well shaved here. He had not yet found his niche as the lovable fellow veteran of several cowboy heroes of films like The Duke. <br /> <br /> Later, he takes his men quite openly at the climax, so I'm not sure what the point is. Of the original trick with the wall safe was. I do not think those who wrote this also knew. <br /> <br /> Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian partner here and the relationship is almost the same as that of a Lone Ranger and a Fool unmasked. <br /> <br /> Everything is pretty silly if you ask me.
