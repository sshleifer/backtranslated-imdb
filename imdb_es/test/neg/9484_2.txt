A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. It feels as if they throw all the imaginable clich√©s in a blender. I especially liked the part, where two teenagers get the French president to clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to the conservation of the environment. Kyoto, someone ?? And the French chef, who apparently has never seen or tasted a hamburger ... This is the reason why people think that Americans do not have culture. That, and the fact that we know their children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (that is, to eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two pre-teens in this movie, but they have almost the same amount of cultural lighting and good manners.
