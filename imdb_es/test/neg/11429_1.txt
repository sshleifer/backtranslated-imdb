Oh, here it is! A movie, which people say to remind me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was a fool to believe that, and OUCH, how my buttocks ached after having forced me to look at this c ** p from start to finish. After the first 10 to 15 minutes, I just wanted everything to end, or at least they could have put some nudity or action or great acid house music to make it worth the time ... But no, when I finished. With it, I put it on my CD shelf and I hope that I will never have to select it again just to show it to a friend who is so anxious to see it that he does not want to listen to my warnings.
