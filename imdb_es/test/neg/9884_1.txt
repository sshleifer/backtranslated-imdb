This movie was boring. Like Underworld, only less interesting. It's not a werewolf movie, nor close to a horror movie. The leading couple was boring. I did not care much about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I did not care about any character in the movie. The plot was very thin. The transformations were basically zero. I liked the wolves, they could have made a documentary of wolves, I would have liked more. I would not recommend this movie. I did not find it funny or interesting. Simply drag and everyone in it is a boring drag. This movie could win a prize for not making a werewolf movie.
