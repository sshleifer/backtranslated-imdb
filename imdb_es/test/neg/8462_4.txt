this movie is not so good ... at all, but it's good when you just want to laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes and it's corny. I got this movie for Christmas 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it away. I guess I like it for a rainy day, although I only see it once a year. This is a movie from the 90s, so it's really fun to see how everyone dresses and performs. This movie is good for someone young ... although now that I think about it, I did not even like it very much when I was 12, but that's just my personal opinion. The movie was really predictable. I wish I had had some weird strange twists but I guess I was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. I think it was appropriate for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a little outdated but certainly appropriate enough for family material.
