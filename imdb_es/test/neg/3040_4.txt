Simon West's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring the excitement of the old school to a contemporary audience. Starring the talented teenager Camilla Belle, when calling Stanger fails to cause a surprised or surprised face. Unsuccessful attempts to scare the audience range from fuzzy coats that look like people to building tense music for a cat that comes out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenager who has to pay a bill to her father through the care of the children. They invite her to work at night in a house by the river, and she thinks it's a perfectly easy way to make money. But little does she know, a stranger lurks in the house and constantly harasses Johnson over the phone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
