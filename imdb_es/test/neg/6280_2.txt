While it has been many decades since I last read Mr. Wells "The War of the Worlds," or "The Time Machine," or any of his other works, I think they were all set in London, or at least In England. . This Grade "B" movie ("C"?) Is set in the eastern part of the United States, as is the excellent radio adaptation of Orson Welles 67 years ago. However, this film does not show the quality of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. The emotion of Thomas Howell would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. Actually, I was embarrassed by him. Rolling through the grass on the hill and shouting "My family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. Of the three film versions of the story I've seen, this was by far the worst, and the 1950 version of Gene Barry is the best. Also, this was the first time I saw a "machine monster" that dripped sticky saliva, as did the creature in the "Alien".
