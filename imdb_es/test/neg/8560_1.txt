I can not even describe it. It's the worst movie I've seen (I'm a good guy when I call it a movie). Just another big budget made for someone who does not like to think much. It is not even scary. It's disgusting when there are great movies that never make it to the big screen and then comes this ... "thing" to fool movie fans. I guess the big producers do what they want. <br /> <br /> Just buy a big producer, beautiful girls (even if they're horrible actresses) and a bunch of horror movie cliches and cook them for about a week, get "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!
