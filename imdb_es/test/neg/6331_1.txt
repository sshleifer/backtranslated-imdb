La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! As it was called in the version that I saw, it starts when several passengers get on a long-distance train. Dave, Phil and Ernie (Carlo De Mejo), three evil idiots, are clear that they are there to cause problems, as they intimidate and verbally abuse other passengers and staff. As the train progresses, things become unpleasant when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his companions decide to hold the whole train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette and, well, not much else actually happens apart from some police hero and his prisoner who set out to save the day. Erm, that's all ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and is total and absolute from the beginning to the end. George Eastman's script as Luigi Montefiori could be described as easily as a really boring porn and a horror thriller. It's tediously slow, 35 minutes pass before something remotely sordid happens and, in general, the film lacks the kind of exploitative elements that Italian deafness and horror offered at that moment. The film can be compared to another Italian production: the house infinitely better than The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), is a very broad comparison, since everything that made The House on the Edge of the Park the notorious film is absent in La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there are only a couple of really docile violations, the story has no twists and turns, and it is incredibly boring to see it. The poor quality and horror of the late '70s and early' 80s are not known for their strong stories or great scripts, but these films really scratch the bottom of the barrel in all respects. The characters are horrible, the film dedicates the first 30 minutes or more to build them and give them information about why they are on the train, but all this is quickly forgotten and is useless. I also hated the final lame and I do not know if I missed anything, but was I given any reasonable explanation as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? I do not think there is, was there? I'm sorry, but because your anger with a prostitute is not a sufficient reason, surely the filmmakers could have found something a little more substantial and interesting, if not more plausible. In my opinion, this movie sucks, it's as simple and direct as I fear. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi does a good job, to be fair, he only has a corridor and some train compartments to work with. I'll give him some slack, having said that the movie becomes very repetitive. There is no style and he films the sex scenes as a bad soft core pornography with piano music that sounds horrible and romantic. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD SPILLED IN ALL THE MOVIE, that is not a single drop. Forget about any bleeding or violence, since you will be very disappointed if you do it, as I did. There are a couple of violations, but they are organized in an amateur way and have a null impact, the unpleasant exploitation and the sordidness of, for example, Spit on Your Tomb (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is doing well and doing pretty well on what must have been a low budget, but the configuration obviously helped keep the cost to a minimum. The performance is poor as usual, although since its nickname the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognize many of the voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I was bored to tears waiting for something to happen and when eventually I never felt cheated, I want to recover those 80 minutes of my life. This piece of junk is not even suitable for decorating the 99p VHS bargain box on your local Blockbuster, one to avoid.
