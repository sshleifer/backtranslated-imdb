Yes, of course, this is a scam on Friday the 13th, but I do not have any problems. It's a good effort, the murders are not so bloody, but the performance of a girl leads the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are well done, well, sometimes you can guess how it's done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can not see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people do not like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course, the script is not original, but give me one that is, I mean, that many recorders are made in the forest. Maybe everything is predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen much worse, I can tell you that
