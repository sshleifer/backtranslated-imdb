I do not know about the rest of the viewers of this movie, but personally I am very sick and tired of Steven Seagal's films. When Above the Law appeared, it was a great action movie. Wahoo Now in Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from Above the Law. I get tired of not seeing character changes. It's the same character, again and again, again and again. He needs change This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've seen in my life. Calling it an action movie is giving it too much credit because there are very few action scenes and they are widely separated throughout the movie. I guess they wanted to go for some drama, but it was a pointless attempt since the film does not represent anything more than the usual narrow-eyed Steven-Seagal we've seen thousands of times. I have a new image and lose the ponytail is all I have to say, I definitely do not recommend watching this movie in any way, go out to eat, heck, rent Barney goes to Las Vegas but in no case rent this movie The precept of that Seagal will do a great performance.
