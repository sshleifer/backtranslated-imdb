This is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now demystified). <br /> <br /> First of all, did the filmmakers understand the concept of "parody" before using it to cover the audience throughout the film? The parody is when a reproduction tries to mock, comment or pay homage through the humor that depreciates the original work. In other words, there should be reasons to parody that work, and they should definitely be smart. I did not see any of those in the movie. I saw some horrible 10-second jokes that faded within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said "hey, last night I was drunk, watching Survivors, and I had this brain in a fart for a direct DVD release, I want you on board without reading the script ... because I plan to direct this movie without one! "<br /> <br /> And here lies the second mystery: the career of Eric Robert. I used to think that Eric Roberts had the career he had because he had bad luck. Now I realize that it is because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career he had). After watching this movie, it is clear that it would have been better if it had entered adult movies, that it has higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and convincing plot lines , and a much wider audience than this rejection of film B (Â¿C-film?).
