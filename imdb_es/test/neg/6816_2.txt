"Dogmatic", as another critic of this film described, is an appropriate word. The idea of ​​the director was to present Bach without argument, acting, fun, theater, dialogue, narrative or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematographic?" No way. This is anti-cinema. Nobody moves. Almost nobody talks. The camera maintains static shots for 10 to 12 minutes at a time: it is very casual for the camera to move inward. You may be able to see Gustav Leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. That is all. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​looking at the back of the head of a harpsichord player (with earwig) for 7 minutes in a row while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I prefer to listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
