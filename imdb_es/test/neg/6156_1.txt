The previous quote almost says it all for "Slipstream". I should have given up on this movie after the first half hour, but I decided it should be fair and give it a try. I will not see him again, so if someone with the temerity to do so can contact me with the number of clich√© lines in the film, I'm sure he will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some otherwise fine and talented actors mixed with this entancer; Mark Hamill plays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. The character of Paxton has kidnapped the prisoner of Hamill, an android that takes its name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so that he and his partner Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can control the pair. The real question is, however, why he did not simply shoot the device at Byron, thus cutting the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy scene after scene unconnected with a tedious characterization and artistic pretension, I guess' I'll find something of interest here. But you can not convince me that the movie makes sense at any level. The scenes of a futuristic Stone Age give way to the snobbery of high society, but the pinnacle of bad taste is reached when the character of Paxton is shown after a night of partying with hickeys throughout the torso. If someone thinks there is some hidden meaning here, you are really stretching. <br /> <br /> Patiently waiting for the "The End" box to appear, unfortunately, even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; This movie did not even have However, there was a unique redemption function when the closing credits began to run: an impressive view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the movie kept them afloat.
