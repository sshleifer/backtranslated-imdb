This film could well have been a propaganda film for the American Falangist party, or some similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) stands above the law (but not outlawed) and releases honest citizens by killing worthless garbage. The only thing that made me think that KKK did not do it was the fact that a Jew played a good guy ... Try to see him again while he considers it as a propaganda movie for a far right group. I'll see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page has created music for this movie ... :(
