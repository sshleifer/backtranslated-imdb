It really hurts me to say it, but this movie was horrible on all levels. The fault is not entirely in Van Damme, as you can see, he did the best he could, but let's be honest, he's almost fifty years old, how much more can you ask him? I find it very difficult to believe that the same people who armed Undisputed 2; It could be said that the best martial arts film (Western) in years, created this. Everything, from the plot, the dialogue, the editing, the acting in general, combined horribly and, in many cases, it was boring and meaningless. Scott Adkins, whose wrestling scenes looked more like a demo reel, was also terribly underutilized and was not even the main villain, which is a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The main villain does not It just was not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. Once again, without blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.
