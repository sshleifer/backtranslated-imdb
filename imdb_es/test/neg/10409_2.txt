This is a small movie that is worth finding and seeing. <br /> <br /> He really talks about all the mundane decisions we all make every day and (like a HG Welles story that I can not remember) can live to wish to come back. <br /> <br /> Note that this is a SHORT (very short). Start slowly, but just when you start thinking that it has become boring = bang = it's over. And, believe me, the 'slam line' is one you'll remember. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if the producers will make it available for purchase, or they will be available on the web, but in any way I would be glad if you took the time to get a copy, I am sure of that .
