A boring movie about a miserable loser ... that's a summary of Factotum. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego of author Charles Bukowski in whose novel the film is based. When we meet Chinaski, he may be a writer, but he certainly is not successful. He floats through life, being fired from one low-class job after another and not caring a little. The fact that he is always drunk may have something to do with not caring. Meet a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and a relationship is produced. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment and now, instead of getting drunk alone, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. Finally, he has had enough of this relationship, so Chinaski attacks alone. Unfortunately, he still can not keep a job as soon as he is bankrupt. At this point, Marisa Tomei appears and, for some reason, her character, Laura, decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she does not even know. Soon we meet some of Laura's acquaintances and the film becomes a kind of bizarre world with this quite eclectic group. Soon, Tomei and her friends are offstage and, once again, we stay with Chinaski and his drink and his miserable little life. Jan spends more time, but in general he only spends his time as a drunken, unemployed loser. And then the movie is over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the film continues. Nothing happens. Nothing ever happens If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching Matt Dillon drink, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters or any entertainment value, you've come to the wrong place. Dillon's performance is not really bad at all. Too bad that the film that surrounds it is, in fact, quite bad.
