Like another critic, I really wanted to like this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and promoter of classical music, but neither of us could stand this film. I would not even call it a movie. A better description could be a record of some camera concert pieces. As I recall, the camera did not even move. Rather, I sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. The only attempts of dramatic effect were at the end of each piece, when the film cut trees waving in the wind or small waves waving on a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to use images of some really big waves, but the best he could find were a few inches high in a nearby lake and again using a fixed camera. Truly pathetic. I can not imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie above five. When we left, my father and I were completely baffled as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I do not know of any good movie about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it does not exist is not a reason to see it. Someone will do it someday. Until then, just keep seeing _Amadeus_.
