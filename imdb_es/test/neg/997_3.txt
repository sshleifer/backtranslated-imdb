Writer and director Robert Downey, father, pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the advertising world of Madison Avenue in New York with his avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope." Downey does not limit his ridicule to advertising, but addresses the militant black culture, the dynamic in the portrayal of the Hollywood race, the power structure of the white elite and the character of corruption in any power struggle. As bold and ambitious as "Putney Swope" strives to be, it qualifies as a terrible film, made in an amateur way with a budget of shoelaces with a nameless cast and a humor that lacks hilarity. Everything about this movie sucks with improvisation. "Putney Swope" sparked controversy during its initial release with its incorrect political handling of racial issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers films, the plot is thin, providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> The president of a prestigious Madison Avenue advertising agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed, the board has a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that he is prohibited from voting for himself. The accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), since nobody thought someone would vote for him. The pink Swope slips everyone except one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black employees, gun packers, and changes the name of the company "Truth and publicity of the soul". Swope decides to alter the face of American publicity. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's clients embark on an exodus after he becomes the CEO, and the great success attracts a new line of clients who show up in their office carrying bags of money and prepared to suffer the abuses of militant employees. Swope. Swope also exploits his African-American staff, ruthlessly appropriating his ideas after he dismisses them and evokes a series of offensive advertising campaigns, all considered a "new wave" of marketing geniuses. Incredibly, the conservatism of Swope is successful, but the agency becomes the target of government agents who argue that Swope's advertising tactics constitute "a threat to national security." The highlight of this 85-minute black-and-white comedy is the color television commercials. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to cut these ads that always start intelligently but exhaust his welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" involves the treatment of our protagonist of the same name with the American president Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana tuff dwarf with a Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) similar to Kissinger who deals to convince Swope to create an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.
