If there is anything worse than this movie I do not want to see it. I remember so many incredible things: a nun came out of a coffin to make a raft for a blond child; the little blond boy adored like a god; Lots of archive footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Sendero Luminoso and Alberto Fujimori should destroy any idea that Peru is a vacation paradise. Everything is so horrible that, in comparison, Plan 9 or even Robot Monster are an aesthetic treatment. This film must be bombed and bombed and bombed again.
