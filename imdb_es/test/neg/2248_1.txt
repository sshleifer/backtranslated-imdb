This is one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A group of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and begins to murder the Germans. You see them attacking their enemies and killing them to death with baseball bats. While you make jokes, of course. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The content is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Below is a subtle political message, because again it is "the good guys" killing "the bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Can you imagine a story where the Nazis (while making jokes) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that it satisfies the strange moral expectations of a given audience: killing people is great when they are made by the right people. <br /> <br /> This movie only works because of the Nazi ideology hidden below. It does not consider the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of fun, I am pleased to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how that violence can fascinate Americans. crowd while a little nudity will scare them. But if a naked body is pornography, this film with all its brutality is pure pornography at its worst. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds is a waste of time and money meaningless, boring and tasteless.
