This is probably my least favorite episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for quite some time. I can tell you that there are no oceanic ships or prawns, fresh crabs or scallops anywhere near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland Cape, which is located on the Mississippi River. It seemed that the license plates were from Mississippi, which could explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are 2 completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of the city and none of them is Route 6 or Route 666. All this inaccuracy was very annoying. Also, Cassie did not seem to be someone who wanted to be with Dean if he had a good education. I did not buy them as a couple and I did not enjoy the long love scene. Jo was more Dean's style.
