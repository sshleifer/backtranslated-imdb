After reading many good things about him, I finally saw "the clear one". With a cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, one would expect at least a decent movie. After the final credits ended, I was still amazed at how bad and incoherent this film really was. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "artistic" movie? I do not think so because it's too melodramatic for that. The trouble is that the drama seems too forced and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The truth is that the script does not make any sense. In the first place, it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters, it simply exaggerates their so-called "personal problems". What's wrong with the life of Redford's character who has to "clarify" him? The fact that he cheats, from time to time, his wife? The man is a millionaire who has had a good life, has a great son and a great daughter, a wife who loves him (and a girlfriend who also seems to be far above the generic type of woman) and a newborn grandchild. The only problem seems to be that he ... has been working hard all his life to be a successful person. So what? It seems that his work has really paid off and there are really no real problems in his life. <br /> <br /> Then we come to the character of Dafoe: here is someone who was manager of one of the Redford companies and was fired. Why is this man unemployed for ... eight years? It seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work (as evidenced by his flashback of a conversation he had with Redford when he was working for him Why can not such a man get a decent job and have a decent life? Because he was once fired. Totally unreal <br /> <br /> The movie really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something like that, and that becomes really corny. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this film tried to say something about the American dream, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> As for the actual events that take place during the movie, they do not make any sense either. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewer. intelligence, because there is nothing that takes place that really makes sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 opportunities to escape, but he does not. At one point he is ready to escape and yet he loses his chance because he feels that he is sorry for his kidnapper and does not want to hurt him. Then, Dafoe raises his weapon from water and mud, which should be useless (if he fires a shot with a weapon after the weapon has been in the water and mud will possibly explode in your face) and the weapon is in perfect condition. !!! The way in which an unemployed, useless character (as described in this film) and mentally unstable, manages to outwit the entire FBI so easily brings the narrative of this film to levels of "twilight zone." The cheesy ending (with the illusion of Redford's wife) comes to end with the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie pretends to be something, it is not (it is a sophisticated and quality psychological thriller). Unfortunately it fails so much, it becomes a disaster and that is the word that describes This movie is the best: A DISASTER.
