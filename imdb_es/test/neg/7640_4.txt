The synopsis of this film led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman who defies the conventions of the society with which she lives. I like strong female characters and I expected a movie very similar to "Chocolat" with a fairy tale less and much more. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a movie based on characters to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for people. There was no one to relate to in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") portrays a mentally ill woman, probably bipolar, often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband fights and screams, when he is not hitting or slapping someone. Children are rude brats. They shout at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence breeds violence. This seems to be an island of insensitive, aggressive, violent and rude people. <br /> <br /> The address is not convincing. There are intermingled scenes that try to be art, but in their place they bore the spectator. The location is exceptionally beautiful, but even that can not be captured to the extent that it could be in a movie. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.
