The movie was disappointing. I saw him on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was exceptional. Maybe while she is nearing the end of her musical career, her condition of desperation takes her to a role that she flaunts, reinvents and triates as her own. Bette's singing is always corpulent, always flat and lacking in showing her ability as an actress. To be entertaining, this performance was dying for a stronger advantage and a stronger cast, so that the others would be memorable in the absence of Bette. Another criticism: smile straight at the camera every time you start singing! I know it's a musical theater, but please, leave some social graces. Middler can not act like Liza or Streisand in a retrospective tour, out of character and out of context.
