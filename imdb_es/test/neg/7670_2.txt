I gave "Airport '79" only two stars because it's a really bad movie. No one who has had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo, Chihuahua, who does a good job in his role). This does not mean that it is not worth watching the movie. It helps if you have a buzzing on, but this is not essential. <br /> <br /> The A'79 really looks like an early version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a configuration and a reward, and the scenes are confused with each other as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, the crew and the plane can move on, no matter what happens. Are you a reporter and a strange guy is killed in your house in your presence? Does the killer chase you on the roof of your greenhouse? No problem. You can still take the flight to Paris early in the morning ... it is not necessary to involve the police. Your plane dodges an unmanned "drone" missile, four missiles that seek heat and the cannon shot of an unidentified ghost fighter, cannon shots, a powerless dive and a network landing with no thrust reversals in the process ? No problem, we will have the mechanics check the oil and start it in a few hours. It is really fun. <br /> <br /> And I'll admit there's a bit of an anarchist in me that comes out when passengers do not pay attention to booth attendants. The highlight is when the assistant tells Jimmie Walker that he will have to keep his saxophone (God save me from a flight sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before takeoff. Jimmie basically says, "No". Later in the flight, the saxophone is damaged during a barrel roll and Jimmie appears on the next stage of the flight with another saxophone he will not save. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (A passenger actually obeys the attendant.) When Charo is told he can not take his dog on the flight, she leaves the plane, which is because you can not see her ass and tits while she is sitting.) <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a little funny. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and the cast do not deserve any credit for this, as it probably was not intentional.
