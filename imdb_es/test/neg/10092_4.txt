Wow, I was really disappointed. I really was not planning to see this movie in the theater, and I would like to follow that plan. It really should be a movie made for television. I was a little excited to see him, since I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie did not do him justice. In fact I am a little disappointed with the overall performance. What a horrible cover-up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it annoyed me every time I saw his shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow in the film, it was very difficult to enter it. In one scene we get angry, we get exalted, we want blood, the anticipation increases, just at that moment the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been nicer to follow if it were divided into three comic strips from Sunday to section. <br /> <br /> There was also little logic behind the chosen characters to interpret some parts. The leaders of the gangsters were squalid types, not very credible. Matt Dillon head of a mafia organization? Come on, give me a break. There was simply no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack ... wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've heard. What horrible guitar solos, my God. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasant for my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is a positive comment that I would like to make about the film. The adjustments were very well made. I liked the colors, a good job that transmits that period of time.
