I am a lover of Shakespeare since childhood. I am also a Jew. Merchant of Venice is anti-Semitic at all times, no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to reinterpret it. <br /> <br /> In the play, Shylock is presented as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness. There is no heat, no love, except for money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind and moral people. His motives in the play revolve around money (he plans a revenge from the beginning based on the damage done to his business and blind racial hatred), not on the noble ideals or racial pride as this film wants you to believe. And this characterization is given by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As a final test, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge this and keep going. It's part of the story and I enjoy Shakepeare despite this fact. Therefore I expect a film based on this work to reproduce it directly. I would prefer to see the work adapted to its rich language and story without any type of money laundering. <br /> <br /> But many of the bard's witty subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie. For example, in the last scene where men discover Portia's undercover work as a man who also took off his rings, instead of the playful play of words and misunderstandings as the truth is revealed, it becomes a mean game where two women Malicious people play cruelly with their future spouses. <br /> <br /> So, instead, we're left with beautiful detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with bad reinterpretation, scant distribution, an intense scene in the courtroom and a controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is that I think it would be much easier to identify anti-Semitism in history and move on if it is left as it is. In spite of all the bleaching that the creators of this film took out of their hats, there is still a lot of hatred, only that now people can make excuses and pretend that the representation of the Jews is not so bad anymore. <br /> <br /> And Finally, another problem is that most actors are misinformed. Pacino is out of his league and feels very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horrible fake accent. Fiennes like Bassanio has no charm and is uncomfortable with language. Irons is reliable as always but does not do much with his role. Portia is a good thing, but it's unpleasant, and it's covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.
