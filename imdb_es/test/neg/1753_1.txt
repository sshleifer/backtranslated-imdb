Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this misdirected, miswritten romance / melodrama on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> is killed by the absence of his lover Law. She just met him when he went to fight for the South in the Civil War, and they only exchanged about 5 prayers and a kiss, however, they are totally hurt. The main direction of the law in everything seems to be `Seeming vacant and in shock, but sensitive '. Rene Zellweger is the only spark in this gloomy script, but he plays too broad and exaggerated, as if he were starring in "Annie Get Your Gun." Yee-hah boy, good! Something about his character felt more like it belonged to a sketch of Monty Python, the "Holy Grail" where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in the mud making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is an actress smart enough to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a hidden comic book within a Victorian novel. <br /> <br /> Each time the action is submerged in a total tedium, which is frequent, all writers do is shout "Cue" the villain type Simon Legree! 'and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes out of nowhere at a gallop to perform his indescribably evil deeds, such as killing and torturing God-fearing innocent people in the name of allegiance to a Confederacy <br /> <br /> that quickly fades away . All other times, he is lost in action, which is absurd even in this cornball script. There are a lot of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters that Law finds himself in while Johnny Appleseed walks from the front lines, where he has defected, to the hopeful embrace of Kidman in Cold Mountain. Ultimately, however, none of these characters matter. The law does not have time for them or for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same theme of weariness: war is a goal of God, and it turns decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the script is too predictable, too clumsy. . Also, the pace of the story is terribly slow. You spend the whole movie waiting for the inevitable reunion of Romeo and Juliet, with Kidman wringing his hands and sighing, Ley overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally arrives, you do not care anymore. He will look at his watch wondering how much more of this applause he will have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give one star in five for the battle scenes. There is a powerful message against the war here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of lives of the Generals on both sides of the conflict is something powerful. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.
