One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins shrinks even appearing in this joke. I can not believe that the name of David Mamet and Ridley Scott appear in this parody. The best career move that Jody Foster ever made was to reject this one. Julianne Moore was as emotional as Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is an invalid victim of Hannibal and the makeup is so good that he did not know it was Gary until the end credits. but eaten by trained boars? Give me a break! It is rumored that he did not want his name mentioned in the credits. And fry and feed your own brain to Ray Liotta ... I was laughing at the absurd, I do not do this stupidity of this movie at this point. I have not seen so many people leave a movie since Who's That Girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to go for you if necessary, but miss this AT ANYTHING!
