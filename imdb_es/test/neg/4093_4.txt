This was a film condemned from its conception. The idea of ​​it was boring: take a supporting character from a mediocre PG-13 movie, and make a full sequel as you change your tone to a PG rated family movie. I was not interested in the least. Then came the trailer. Not only did he confirm that the film would be funny and generic, but he also managed to give the whole movie away; and I'm not exaggerating: in every moment, in every plot, in every joke that is told in the trailer. It's like a 3 minute version of Cliff's Notes from the movie. So obviously I was not going to pay to see it, but once I got to the DVD, I thought I'd see it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I'm still baffled as to why you signed up for this. He should have done someone a favor. The jokes were so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to choose a very broad comedy style like Bruce Almighty's original Jim Carrey. But it's not funny. Obviously, the studio tried to capitalize on the success of 40-year-old Virgin, complete with several of Carell's previous co-stars, a reference to the movie in a theater marquee and another sequence of closing credits. But even the talented Carrell can not save this. Their castmates do not fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms simply squandered. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, it's just a waste of everything she does, and her horrible phrases and reactions make you want people to stop working. <br /> <br /> The story itself is predictable and lazy. It hits you in the head with obvious omens, like Evan's contempt for the environment (he drives a Humvee that consumes a lot of gasoline, chooses to use the wood of the trees in danger of extinction for his house, hates the animals, .. .), and in the end it is about to end. -the maximum preaching on faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> The reason why the film was made is quite disconcerting, but I really do not understand how it became the most expensive comedy in history. The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of these in the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue / green screen jobs I've seen. Maybe renting live animals on the set costs a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it was that cost them so much, it did not translate into quality, that's for sure. But hey, it was not the worst movie of the year by far. There are still many worse such as Norbit and Death Proof.
