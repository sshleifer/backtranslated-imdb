I'm pretty dumb for those Ghost Hunter shows. From Cheesy simulators, such as "The Haunting" by Discovery Channel, to Scooby Doo Reality, as "Ghost Hunters". When I saw promotions for the "Paranormal State" of A & E, I knew I was going to see. Especially when "Paranormal State" was juxtaposed against a weak Monday Night Football game. <br /> <br /> At the end of the "Paranormal State" pilot, when the "main character" in this macabre dance reality gives a Creepy Kid. a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him by telling this child that he also had a bad experience not specified as a child with things that "came out" and the Church (Catholic) gave holy water to Defend the things that came out of the closet. I knew I should have given Monday Night Football a try. <br /> <br /> The trap behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who met and started their own Ghost Hunting Club. Or society. O Super Adventure Club. And they travel through Pennsylvania investigating the most terrible apparitions and the lost plot of a film by M. Night Shymalan. <br /> <br /> The "They" are a kind of inappropriate name. Really Paranormal State revolves around a Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell, who would probably direct Penn State's Annual Anime Convention if it were not for this show. He is often accompanied in the "investigations" of hot co-eds and some other people who are seen in the credits, but are rarely captured by the camera. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal status is your "vehicle" as we like to say in the Biz. And, oh, what a boring ride it can be in a vehicle. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Ryan tells the whole episode of Paranormal State in a "director's record" voice without a star date? Almost immediately, that becomes annoying because the obvious intention is to give Ryan's ghost the hunt for some gravitas, but his monotonous filtering does nothing but provoke grunts and laughter. Seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio talk of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> The "investigations", the plot on which each episode revolves, are interesting on the surface. There are no posadas or enchanted restaurants that are in "paranormal state". This is a program about fearing the unknown as a good Catholic child and, by God, they give you things to fear. <br /> <br /> Young children are harassed, things appear in the dark, voices encourage the living to kill, and the Aleister Crowely in me rubs my hands. Of the two episodes that I saw, each revolved around violent and unpleasant appearances related to violent and unpleasant deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is reduced by half an hour, the blocks "Dog the Bounty - er, Ghost Hunter". Whenever there is an interesting and verifiable fragment of evidence, the murder of a family on a farm in the 19th century, the evidence is shown to the viewer as a con man trying to convince him of a stack of papers currently under his nose. Proof that ten million come from Nigeria and then retire before you can take a good look. <br /> <br /> At least with the "Ghost Hunters" of Sci-Fi Channel, there is a somewhat exaggerated need to bring up every piece of evidence and present it to the viewer. The EVPs that could be a rat in farts, cold spots in a house with drafts, and "orbs" that even the Ghost Hunters discard as dust. It's kind of a Scooby Doo type approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost believable. <br /> <br /> While "Paranormal State" claims to have EVPs but gives the viewer a ten-second video of a Wave File in Garage Band without audio. Yes, see, an EVP, right? People say they are seeing dark figures in the basement ... Well, we'll just go and see that ... while we leave the night vision camera in a captivating still photography of the living room. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this group of graduates from Penn State, claims that he sees "visions" of the name of a demon he knows and that he could be involved in a paranormal obsession ... But he can not tell us, the audience, or his team of gothic graduates, because ... He can not. You never say the name of a demon out loud, Ryan informs the open-eyed Co-Ed he dares to ask. <br /> <br /> Well, what's very convenient for you. Especially since it is a television program where the public can not read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal state" is all Turn and no Prestige. The audience is told what is supposed to be happening, but you never see an ounce of proof that the spooky child is seeing the dead. Not even a grainy video of a moving chair, or a black spot that runs between the cells of the prison. Nothing. You are only told what happened to Ryan in another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you're going to try to scare me, dress it up a bit. If you're trying to influence me, show me an orb or a bubble and have the fat girl working at Hot Topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax killer. And if you want to show me a ghost hunting program, give me something besides taking Lorraine Warren out in the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal state" is a weak sauce. It really is not worth seeing unless it's hard for TV time or just have a DVD collection. Or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water.
