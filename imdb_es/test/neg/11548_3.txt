This entertaining and entertaining television movie of the mid-80s, is based on the premise that the sex bomb Donna Mills (in a wardrobe in its most frightening) is a careless housewife, who longs for his sexy past as a cheerleader . He escapes his empty life by fantasizing about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men he meets, finally abandons his fantasies and lets himself be carried a little aside, although the only thing he really wants is to rekindle the flames of passion with her. boring husband James Brolin. <br /> <br /> There are many aspects of laughter in this film, Mills' first foray into co-production (later, after his departure from Knots Landing, he found great success as a queen of bad TV movies). quality starring most of the melodramas of the week throughout most of the 1990s, he generally played a victim of some kind, clearly determined to wash his hands of the wonderfully evil and entertaining stalker he played for a long time in Knots ). The most fun are the fantasy sequences extracted, filmed as if they were intended to be soft pornography (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porn music), but since it is a TV movie, the scenes are all very chaste and Ultimately not very sexy at all The funniest (and weird) scene has Mills strolling down the wild side of the center among punk-haired punks (complete with Robert Palmer's soundtrack). <br /> <br /> Less frightening is the gruesome dialogue that the cardboard characters have to pronounce (one must consider poor Cicely Tyson as a compulsory psychoanalyst, or Veronica Cartwright as the obligatory best friend, or even before Babs, James Brolin with that fist-clenched daytime soap style.) <br /> <br /> Of course, as with all these types of films, we learn that all problems can be solved through psychotherapy and then the movie becomes stupid, while we explore, briefly, the reasons for Mills' "shocking" behavior (as if it was not because he wants a good fluff!) <br /> <br /> Vacuous.
