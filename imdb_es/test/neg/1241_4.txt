This program is like watching someone who is in training to one day host a program. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre. It does not seem that writers know the difference between what is funny and what is weird or disgusting. <br /> <br /> It has its moments. When Spike knocked down a neighbor who had been letting his dog run his lawn repeatedly, it peaked. But the funny moments are very few, and there are too many fragments of experimental comedy that fail. <br /> <br /> The program is better than, for example, seeing a test pattern or the QVC network, but you need some better writers. . <br /> <br /> As I read the positive comments from IMDb about this program, I am convinced that most of them were written by staff from the program and by family and personal friends of Spike. <br /> <br /> It's just not very good most of the time.
