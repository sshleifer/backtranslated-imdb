This film is so copied, full of clichés, clumsy and laborious, I find it amazing that no one can feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. <br /> <br /> Here is the range of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologization and simply unfeasible narration in this "blunt" representation of the high school: the hard guy is really a homosexual. Student A is not happy because his father pushes him and in some way this causes him to commit incest. A teacher is bad for a student who wets his pants in class. A girl who goes out with the aforementioned athlete is really in love with him and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only salvation is the student advisors scene that is vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this movie are so full of lead that it breeds belief. <br /> <br /> This movie does not show information about teenagers and I would not be surprised when it bombs, especially with teenagers. People who like this movie seem to be concerned parents for their teenagers, and if they are thinking that this movie will help them "understand" the problems of teenagers, they are barking the wrong tree. I mean, what's the moral of this movie? "Hello, guys, let's take care of each other and hug each other" GIVE ME A BREAK. Anyone who thinks they can communicate with a 14-year-old child with that kind of message should remember. In the 1980s we were watching Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This movie will fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is at the height of another "independent" Australian movie, "One Perfect Day," which was as bad as this turkey from a movie. Thank God, no taxpayer money was spent on this boloney. <br /> <br /> AVOID!
