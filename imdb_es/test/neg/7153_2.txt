This is a road movie. At least the movie is in yellow and I think that suggests a road movie (?). I can not say much positive about the delivery. It's a bad performance, no doubt your English. The camera seems to be made by a child, there is a bomb with an accountant and, suddenly, a beetle falls from the sky. Since it was so cliché, we actually laughed all the time, and that was the funniest thing in the movie. This movie should be released in the United States, but I'm not sure you should go because that could suggest that that is the quality we produce. The explosions look boring. Basically everything is above. Everything is too much: yellow quality, sound, baby, etc. Find all the cliché parts in other movies, collect them and you have The Delivery.
