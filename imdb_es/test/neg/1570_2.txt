Let me start by saying how much I love the television series. The nature of class war was always going to be a mockery issue, but this television series exploits it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote episodes almost completely impeccable at all times. In my opinion, it is the best British comedy from the mid to late 1970s, beating RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE WE SERVED? and so. With the ON THE BUSES series finished a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now known), enjoying a four-year career on the channel. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. The general essence of the television series has been almost totally stripped away by the writers of this abysmal film (whom anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). As one commentator has already pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had in the television series and does not seem to be too dominant. <br /> <br /> The plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles That was the basis of the television series, actually writing the Fourmiles almost completely after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it that, is that George and Mildred go on vacation to a hotel and mingle with the mobsters. First class talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are wasted here. Most of them have passed their peak and everyone looks very embarrassed, as if they knew very well that the only thing worth doing is a paycheck (which probably is not much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes of the film (if you can call them that) depend largely on the traditional British farce, including the wrong identities, the embarrassing situations, the badly synchronized slapstick, the characters that They lose control of what is happening to them and the general confusion. And everything fails miserably. As another commentator has pointed out, it seems that the writers of this film have never seen an episode of the television series and, instead, they have created an object similar to a CARRY ON romp. The scene in which the character of Sue Bond strips George is particularly out of context. <br /> <br /> A mystery that surrounds this film is the certification that BBFC awards: 15. Why does it have a rating of 15 when all there is to see? Is it harmless, non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that the era of the spin-off comedy came to an end shortly after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this film, Hammer, well known for producing first class horror films in the 1950s in the mid-1970s, soon disappeared into total darkness. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is almost a total failure. . My advice: skip this and stick to the television series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
