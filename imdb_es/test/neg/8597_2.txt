The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie that I showed to many people and that they loved, but for some strange reason he did not like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and tells me that he showed it to many people and that they loved it, instead he hated this movie. I do not think I've hated a movie so much for a long time, how this movie even has a 6.6 rating surpasses me. I could not keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin became a man of fire, the random rivalry between brothers, the random love story, the story of who is arson, the investigator, the fire that has a personality of its own. I just have a problem that this movie can not keep up with all these stories, they did not balance well enough to make the movie interesting. I would have preferred this film to be about being a firefighter or an investigator and how it came to be or what exactly it does and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago Firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires he fights. Brian, the younger brother, dropped out of the fire academy school several years earlier and then embarked on a series of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. His older brother looks at him with contempt and hopes that he will fail in his newly chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a fire investigator who is dedicated to his profession. It is called because a series of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is a councilor at City Hall. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but has had to make several budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the senior firefighters believe that the cuts they have made are endangering the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak initially succeeds in portraying the fire department as inflated and ineffective after firefighters are repeatedly killed in flames. <br /> <br /> I just could not get into this movie, I do not know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed the firefighters all wrong. I loved the way they had every action clich√© in the book to match this action movie. I also felt that there was a great talent wasted in such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been assumed by a lesser known man who had the talent nearby at that time. I know Ron was going for a great quality, but I think that choosing such big actors in small roles was a mistake for this movie. I even had to joke while watching this movie commenting that the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was so amazing, I did not enjoy it and, honestly, I would not recommend it to people, from this moment I will follow the recommendations in my relationship. <br /> <br /> 2/10
