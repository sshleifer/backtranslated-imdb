Apparently, this was an award winner. Apparently, someone had a gun to his head and he was forced to nominate Maize: the Movie. <br /> <br /> Or this must have been an error. <br /> <br /> This is the hardest movie to watch ever made. Projection and editing is the greatest horror of this movie. Two girls are lost in a field of corn and are harassed by someone who can be heard laughing under their rubber mask. The girls meet their hero father and then run away from him, W.T.F. The hero father in the movie continues to lose them in the few minutes of watching this. <br /> <br /> The girls obviously were not trained actors, and they had no common sense for them. They were so annoying and so childish in the film, that they were not remotely comical. Listening to them screaming again and again like a broken record was the reason why I got up and left. You can not even listen to this movie without almost convulsing. <br /> <br /> I can throw up a prize winner better than this crap.
