Shemp discovers that he can inherit a million dollars IF he is married within 24 hours. Considering how horrible she looks and her personality, it is not surprising that she can not obtain a candidate, that is, until an article appears in the document explaining her situation, in which five crazed women do not appear from where to affirm . her new husband (plus money, of course). <br /> <br /> Although I do not hate the Three Stooges and I like to see their shorts on occasion, never, even on their best day, did they get close to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy. That's why I disliked this movie, since it was a scam of the plot of Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN OPPORTUNITIES. With the Stooges, it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or simply recycle the older Stooge shorts. Then, from the beginning, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced (especially the scene of the telephone booth). However, the cousin Basil bit was pretty cute and fun, though far from being subtle! However, the worst aspect of the film was the conclusion not particularly funny. In Keaton's version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him and the action became very fast and furious: here, they all stayed in a small room and lacked a comic punch, which ended in a fizzle. <br /> <br /> In general, a bored refoulement. Also, before marking this review as "not useful", make sure you FIRST see SEVEN OPPORTUNITIES to see what I'm talking about; Then, you decide.
