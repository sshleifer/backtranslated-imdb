Actually, the average is the only word that comes to mind when you see this. <br /> <br /> The performance was average (perhaps a bit above average), the use of the camera was average (actually below average.) The image was so unstable and the colors were grainy and fuzzy. ) The plot was good but it moved at such a slow pace and was not put to good use. <br /> <br /> This could have been much more if it was not at a snail pace and we saw more in the backgrounds of the characters. <br /> <br /> All we see are flashbacks here and there about Alice and how her life at home is so "bad" (her mother is a working-class woman who tries to come to an end with her and her We see a flashback of her when she was in high school and her friend says "tell your mom to make a better meal" and "everyone says it's your mom."

Would you run away from that? <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mom was drunk or if someone was abusing her, but she was not wrong with her home, except that she was embarrassed ... How immature! <br /> <br /> We have not even been given an idea of ​​how the life of the couple has been (except that they have been prostituting for a while and the woman, forgot her name, left her baby when she was 9 years old). age.) This really could have been much more. I could have had Alice, who was abused by her drunken mother, going to Florida with her friend, but then she became a prostitute.

It did not seem genuine. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia). <br /> <br /> 4/10 It really is not worth your time in my opinion.
