So bad, it's entertaining, especially during the cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink or whatever to go through this turkey. Where do you get financial backing for those "horror" movies of painting by the numbers? The fun in this film is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order, and to destroy the so-called "uniforms" that wear the "military" jokers. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors that we met in "Jurassic Park", but a kind of cousin. (Sorry, there are no spoilers here, you'll have to see it to discover it for yourself) Do not expect the plot to make sense, however simple it may be, just keep going with the trip. You could turn it into a game ... take another drink every time you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, every time someone is crushed by a "raptor". With any luck, you will not even remember seeing this movie made for "C-grade" television!
