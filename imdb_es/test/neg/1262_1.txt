Did you ever wonder which is the worst movie ever made? Stop asking yourself I'm telling you, Michael, it's that! <br /> <br /> It is not "comforting", "entertaining" or "Travolta at its best." It just sucks. If I had children, I would let them see Deep Throat before Michael! <br /> <br /> An exhausted John Travolta, a quiet and washed William Hurt, and a dying man at any moment, now Jean Stapleton's highlight is this large number of films. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you can hear Andie McDowell sing! Yes. Hollywood really is not about us with this one!
