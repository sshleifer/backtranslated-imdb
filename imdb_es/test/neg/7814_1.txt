This movie has to be one of the worst I've seen. The humor was raw, hardly funny and had been heard a million times before. The beginning was special and worsened as it progressed. I reached the middle and could not stand to see more. Fortunately, I was only watching it on TV, so it did not cost anything, but I strongly recommend that you do not waste your time or your money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was new. The characters were not developed at all. In fact, I think it would have been better as a movie for young children since it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events that happen ... that's what happens at home alone or something like that. Not to imply that alone at home was somehow as terrible as this.
