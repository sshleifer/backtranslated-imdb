I was invited to an early screening of the film about four months before it was released. I had to watch the movie and then fill a package with my thoughts. It was the hardest thing to sit on the ground. The show simply creeps and you quickly begin to wish you were dead. The thing is that there are two types of Mormon movies. The good ones with real stories and the bad ones that just suck. Saints and soldiers, now there is a good movie. But, with these aspiring comedies, writers and actors try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. It's no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films; They are full of 'inner jokes' that are not funny to begin with, and they just try to make fun of normal things. It is the story that makes the film, and the stories of these films are weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when they told me to complete it after the movie. ;)
