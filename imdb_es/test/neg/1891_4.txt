I guess the previous movie "House" was a success, which led Universal to wring a few more drops of the monstrous cow. The creative team must have been in a recycling environment, starting with the opening theme of 'Son of Frankenstein' and some of the archival images scattered throughout the film, like a little bit of fun business where the image Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with the Karloff clips of the 1935 Bride, and compared to how sturdy Strange moved, Karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison. <br /> <br /> The continuity of the previous film is thrown down the road, with respect to the miraculous death of Deceased Wolf and Dracula's deceptive abilities, but when Dr. Edelmann and Larry Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster with the Skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe at least acknowledges some of the film's past history, although Talbot curiously never mentions having met Karloff Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> Since this was to be the last of Universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac are transformed (unconvincingly) into medical ailments. Drac is told that he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if the sun touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot just has a little pressure on the brain. Of course, all this is explained thoroughly with a large amount of medical jargon related in many scenes. This proves to be the biggest obstacle, since at some point along the way the filmmakers seem to forget the real horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as a flu. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the old universal horrors, it is rare that I feel so bored while I see one. Everything feels like a movie that was made just because it could be, but if this mess had not been hit, the monsters would never have met Abbott and Costello, so I guess something good came out of this.
