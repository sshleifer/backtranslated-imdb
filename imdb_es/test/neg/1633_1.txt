Why was this movie made? Do the sadists deceive the producers so easily that they will give them money to create torture methods like this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" is pushing it. It is very painful to physically look. The plot has something to do with the name of a friend Ator, a dormant number I'll call Private Snowball for the rest of this review, who has to fight against invisible warriors and rescue a princess to beat the bad guy she needs. Find a better stylist. Maybe I was wrong about the plot since it's been a while since I saw this excrement, but really, do you care so much? Ah, yes, Private Snowball also has a mute Asian partner (who does not?). Who is not fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Private Snowball fights against invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king so free of personality that makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a hang glider (yes, really) and takes the girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It is cheap, involuntarily foolish and insensitively insensitive. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up doing porn? <br /> <br /> In a few words: AVOID. Ator will steal a part of your life and you will not have any funny funny words about "so bad-are-good" to take with you from the experience. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! * gags *
