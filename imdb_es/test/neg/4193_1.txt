Anyone can make a movie these days. The budget, the production value or the experienced crew do not have to prevent the "director" who describes himself from "making his dream come true" these days. <br /> <br /> Respect for the job of making films, or even just respect for any film, aesthetics is no longer a prerequisite for the execution of a film. <br /> <br /> Director Bill Cowell must have thought he had won the gold when Lion's Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a movie he had nothing to do with. <br /> <br /> I personally find that Lion's Gate is much more erroneous than Cowell regarding Dark Harvest 2 being available to the public. The misleading marketing of Lion's Gate in this film must be investigated by the state attorney general's office and Lion's Gate officers must be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their total disregard for the film, the making of films and good sense. . > As for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.
