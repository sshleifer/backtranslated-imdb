Fred "The Hammer" Williamson offers another cheap movie. He could have set a new standard for himself. Look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible on the street during a chase scene. You do not see it only once, you see it several times. Look for the unfocused shot in a scene and the camera operator tries to fix it as the scene progresses. Watch this with a group of people and create your own Mystery Science Theater!
