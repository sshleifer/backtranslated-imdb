I saw "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I said I remember it in detail; What I remember most vividly is the irritation that caused me and the feeling of a total loss of precious time and money, not only my time and money invested in watching the film, but also in that of the director. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, "Fuckland" is a critic of Argentines, introducing us (I am also Argentine) as small people who recognize and even boast of insignificant and ridiculous victories, and think that we are the best God ( which is also an Argentinean) created. I will not discuss that. It is likely to be a true statement about a large part of the population (the part that I despise, by the way). And even if this were not true, that's not my point. The worst sin that "Fuckland" committed was to express a similar statement about his own director. <br /> <br /> The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us by hiding a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good movie (even a mediocre one). Many of the shots made with a hidden camera are useless. The director chooses to boast with a silly edition of old war tomes and his own. And there is no plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the initial titles, only to disrespect its principles (for example, by including the director in the credits, another sign of Â¿Su pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the movie offensive, not as Argentine, but as a spectator. I felt underestimated. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I've seen.
