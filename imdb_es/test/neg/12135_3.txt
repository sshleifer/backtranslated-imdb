UP IN THE VILLA he tricked me into believing that I would be seeing something similar to GOSFORD PARK. The film starts in a ballroom in the Italy of 1930, populated by vulgar Americans and upper class British, but in reality UP AT THE VILLA is presented much more as a production of Merchant -Ivory which is very bad news because it is very slow. and I mean a very slow romantic drama with some romance that is very unlikely. If you like slow romantic dramas, maybe you like this movie. I did not do it
