This is possibly the worst I've seen on television. First, I'm pretty sure he takes everything seriously, and I tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire. Second, it shows Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; In one of the advertisements, one of the "beaches" describes women in terms of "quality". Third, every participant I've seen in him (six, I think) was an imbecile of the variety that probably has a Facebook with "BONING U" or "WOMAN" entered in "Here For". To paraphrase Roger Ebert, this does not scrape the bottom of the canyon, nor does it deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the barrels. The closest thing to a redemption feature I have experienced with respect to Key to the VIP was that a friend assured me that the male cast was the opposite of attractiveness, both physically and mentally.
