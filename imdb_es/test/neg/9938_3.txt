Woohoo! This is the movie that must be shown on TV at two in the morning at Cinemax for all those insomniacs (the man knows that they would probably faint from boredom when watching this movie) Terrible performance, the murderer is far from scary, I have Clowns were seen in the carnivals that scared the most. In this film there is a lot of unnecessary 'skin', pseudo-porn scenes that are horrible in more than a million, a script in the style of a soap opera that really hurt the film and that the director really did not have talent for the genre that Crea was trying with this movie I could see a group of teenagers with their parents' video cameras doing a better job than this. I do not think there's a part of me that can recommend this movie to anyone ...
