Well ... how and where do I begin to describe this complete nonsense? Imagine the morals of a corny Hollywood Western, throw a sumptuous portion of the history of the most trite soap opera, and try to trick children into thinking it's cool dressing them up as if it were something "contemporary". This movie is all package and absolutely nothing of substance. <br /> <br /> Start with a promise ... young men who dream of becoming rock stars and get involved in the kind of excessive worship of heroes that everyone can laugh at. After that, everything goes downhill ... faster than a sleigh without brakes. The scene that involves the first concert with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of "kitsch cinema" I've seen in a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs ... will he rise and sing? ... or he will stay there on the floor and he will not sing ... Who cares now? It gets worse, but I do not want to get bored having to remember it in all its unbearable details. If you see it after this review, it's your fault!
