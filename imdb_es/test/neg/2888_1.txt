This movie is worse than horrible! He took a plot of good history and turned it into a schizophrenic cinema. Photography is EXTREMELY amateur. . . it looks like a 5ยบ-grade home movie project filmed with 8mm children's cameras that are malfunctioning. . . the editing seems to have been done by someone with psychotic flashbacks (while using drugs and alcohol), with shortened scenes, followed by other unrelated scenes, and then segments cut from glued scenes. . . Totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity. . . Missing scenes . . The day scenes inexplicably turn into night scenes and then, suddenly, they come back to day. . . obviously there is no continuity. The good acting skills of Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason are wasted, as are the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and the Anderson women - very amateur acting). This movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . Just do it professionally this time.
