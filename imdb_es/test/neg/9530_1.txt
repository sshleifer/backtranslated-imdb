The reviewer at Variety said that this was "overwritten and too long", and I agree with that. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup, once again as the man 'lost, vacant and a little bored') and Julianne Moore find a map of the United States in an amazing place. The story is one of the stories of "man must find meaning in his life" in the 1970s, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson at his best playing the role of Cal. However, the whole theme of " follow the path to find a meaning in life "is still interesting. Does everything really take the family? I was not so sure. The acting is fine, I particularly liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I would give you a 'five'.
