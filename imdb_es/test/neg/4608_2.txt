I would have given a 1 to this movie, but I laughed so much that so many times that I had to give it a little credit, in the possibility that the movie was funny. A film so bad that you'll think it was written by chimpanzees. You wish the chimps had written it. So canned dialogue that only that and the cockroaches will survive the next nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by interspersing scenes of Original Carrie (a really good movie) in scenes of this. As intersplicing scenes of Taxi Driver in Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone, since you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone at your side to confirm the evil of what you are seeing. The worst actress of the Millennium addresses poor poor Amy Irving as the counselor of the school, monotonous and wooden disastrously made of stone. The worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
