(HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he also likes it.) It's amazing how intelligent and talented people even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It is amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has returned from nature and has made a mark for himself. <br /> <br /> And I really expected a great movie (What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress). As intense as Reshamiya is what I thought, I would excel in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, it is represented in the same way, but why does it matter? Pure incompetence, carelessness, horrible acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> The rule of errors. (For example, how can the German police issue public instructions on an English speaker? They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become the standard in the main line of Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but many bad ones too. The worst part is that most people simply do not care. <br /> <br /> The songs are the only ones that keep salvation ... <br /> <br /> Please, do not repeat this HR and find yourself a good director (under budget .. No problem) . <br /> <br /> The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all, it's a 50Cr film.
