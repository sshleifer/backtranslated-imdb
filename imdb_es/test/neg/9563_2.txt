It goes without saying that a minimum of concessions should be made when a real story is being adapted for the big screen. But if you shoot a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what really happened, why call it Bugsy and make the audience believe that this was a half story? The Godfather trilogy processes many characters and real events. Once upon a time in the United States it also does it, but they do not pretend to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the movie, Benny has this great vision of Eldorado from a player; In real life, Lansky had to discuss it to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​a counterpart in Monte Carlo an idiot, and would have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in L.A. It was not until much later that Benny accepted the idea. But, of course, he is the hero of the movie, so, naturally, the idea had to be his. <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny wants to use Count diFrasso to approach Mussolini and kill him because it was him. Hitler's partner, and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers, after all. Obviously, we're supposed to like Benny, so the writers invented this nonsense. In real life, at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, and least of Benny, who had no interest in politics. In fact, he used the countess's connection and visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell him explosives. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> All of Greenberg's secondary plot did not make sense. Greenberg did not become a pigeon, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (that was up to Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they had the correct name. <br /> <br /> I guess it was supposed to be very romantic that Virginia would come back with Benny, offering her the money she had stolen. The film even goes so far as to tell us through text panels that it returned the money to Lansky sadly after Benny's murder. Let me say that revisionism does not impose itself more than this. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive: there is a problem that Benny's family does not live in Los Angeles, the way Benny deals with Dragna and Adonis, the portrait of Costello (a type unpleasant corporate), Lansky (an adorable teddy bear), Benny himself (an aging windbag who would not have turned 12 years old if he had become "bored" in situations like those in the movie, and what is more , who does not have the good looks and charisma of Benny Siegel) and many others. Apart from some concrete data, nothing is good in this movie. <br /> <br /> * THE SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> In general, this is the only Mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculous. bad that Harlem, NY But honor where honor is due: this is a feat in itself.
