If someone tells you that this image is simply fantastic, it probably has something to do with it or benefit from it. This movie is a real loser and copy situations of big budget horror films and not to mention the soundtracks. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a movie contest. The acting is terrible and I would not be surprised if the script was written by a Hee Haw writer. My family laughed at it. One degree ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.Z You will not be frightened by this. Here is a small sample of the terrible elements of this movie. When the boy has his foot trampled by the stupid portrait of Ric White of Reverend James Johnston walking in walking stick. The reactions of the boys are as if he had had an amputation without analgesic. Watch the DVD extras after watching the movie. When you see Ric White and others talking so seriously about the movie, you'll laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest money. Do not be fooled like we did and buy this failure.
