Well, the first thing I saw after looking at the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and I thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was once a good movie here, but after the incredibly poor production values ​​of acting and "video games," this ends up resembling Tron's late brother. The first scene establishes the general atmosphere of the whole movie. Five minutes later, you will be asking yourself: "What the hell am I seeing?", And only a snowball will form from there. A horrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" rounds out this miserable piece of shit in a ridiculously bad movie. On a side note, the most romantic quote # 3 in a movie: "I think you're the final destination."
