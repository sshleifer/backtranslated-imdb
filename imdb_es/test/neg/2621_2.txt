The Retro Puppet Master begins in Kolewige in 1944, where the puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his living puppets plan to escape from Germany, they hold in an Inn the puppet master Toulon remembers his early life and the moment in which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects in 1902 in Paris, when his younger self (Greg Sestero) directed Theate Magique. Describes the fateful night when he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel (Jack Donner) and the eventual love of his life to the beautiful young Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). Tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life and gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the Magique Theater show. However, the gift of life was also a curse, since the ancient God Sutek, from whom the secret was stolen by Afzel in the first place, wants it back and all those who have learned it dead ... <br / > <br /> In recent times I have been in a bit of a Puppet Master teacher as a big fan of the first three. I decided to see the rest of the franchise and as such I have seen Puppet Master 4 (1993), Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994), Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master in the course of a couple of weeks and it was difficult to overcome them, especially this one since it is the worst of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III: The Revenge of Toulon (1991) with its vintage setting & Puppet Master 4 and Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill all those associated with his secret stolen life. Nor is there much continuity here, again, there is nothing of the green serum that appears in the previous films and, although Andre Toulon committed suicide in 1939 at the beginning of the original Puppetmaster (1989), in 1944 he is seen alive and well . Most of the story is told as a flashback and focuses on Andre Toulon himself rather than on the puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and he learning the secret of life and everything is quite boring and tedious for to be honest. Even in just 80 odd minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels long and padded without a real rhythm and a non-central concept, since the plot never sets and generally skips a lot. Then, of course, there is the disconcerting decision to completely redesign the puppets that I found incredible. I mean, why did the creators take the one basic thing that made Puppet Master's films so memorable and eliminate them completely? The puppets are seen briefly at the beginning and end, but otherwise, we'll get these disheveled-looking wooden cartoons that are not as interesting as their modern remodeling. It is not even explained why these puppets were used instead of what all Puppet Master fans have come to love, although one suspects that Full Moon expected to make another sequel to address that same question. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite puppets was not bad enough. Full Moon decided to go with a PG-13 rating to make Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master movie without an 'R' rating in the US. UU (Obviously, other countries have their own film classification systems) and, therefore, there is not a single drop of blood in the whole movie, the puppets do not kill anyone, you can not swear or nudity. This is smoother than the things of the children domesticated all the way. Besides that the puppets are garbage, the special effect is the most important thing of the series, there is no stop motion animation in this, there are no CGI computer effects (surely in 1999, the CGI technology was cheap enough?) AND all the effects are of rigidity. Puppet type effects of rod. I mean when you see a puppet "walking", the camera is always placed above the wait, so it is not necessary to show its legs and obviously there is a production assistant who simply pushes the thing, that is so complex and advanced as the special effects are seen. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that Retro Puppet Master has is that it looks pretty good, the design of the period, the costumes and the accessories are really impressive and it is a very attractive movie. to look sometimes. Apparently filmed in Bucharest, in Romania, it doubles quite well by the end of the last century in Paris. The performance here is horrible and maybe the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final film of Puppet Master, since the following one is Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) that basically edits together images of the seven previous films and is a quite Horrible to round out the series that started so well with three excellent and distinctive puppet movies. Do not bother with this, just look at one of the first three and remember the good times ... The killer puppets would return with the terrible spin-off movie Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys (2004).
