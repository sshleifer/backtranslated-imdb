For starters, I'm very happy. I am by no means a true critic, and the movies that critics, friends, relatives and authentic newspapers can find terrible can even be fun for me to watch. <br /> <br /> however, it is not. <br /> <br /> I got it since it was the newest movie from Wesley snipes in my DVD store. I like snipes, but this was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> bad story, bad actors, failures in continuity, horrible sound, depressing places, pseudo-cool snipes, I really had to force myself to finish. The movie. <br /> <br /> They even left some marks in the shots where a car was supposed to stop. <br /> <br /> and I'm not talking about "small production company / young director / low budget" something bad, where you can ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> an action movie that wants to be a block blocker that does not disappoint in a long time.
