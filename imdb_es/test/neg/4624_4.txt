This movie started with some promise: cast of big names, good looks sets, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you can not tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. One minute they're talking about there's no joy in killing and the next there's a fight scene with funny music and funny jokes. <br /> <br /> Part of the acting is pretty bad, mainly from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also receives some complaining phrases like: "When I get married, it will be about love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. There is not enough action, there is not enough humor, there is not enough plot, there is not much of anything in reality. Only a lot of clich√©s and corny moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, a movie with "Dragon" in the title must contain many more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> Can not the SciFi channel show * some * good movie?
