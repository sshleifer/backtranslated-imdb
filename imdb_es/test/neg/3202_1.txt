Did not the writer of this movie see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, that I tolerated 3 (it was good, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dares to kill UG? This certainly was not the Ug that had been almost like a brother to Charlie in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said: "You would not leave me alone on Earth, you would." Ug replied, "Charlie, bounty hunter," saying that he was now one of them now. How do writers dare to ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a villain who is killed by Charlie (in a particularly uncomfortable scene) only because they realized that the movie was getting boring? In fact, during the first 20 minutes, we have a new cast and we have to wait so long until we discover again what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we've been waiting to see. I kept waiting saying, "Come on, when will Charlie appear?" Angela Basset must be doing everything possible to deny that she was ever in this Turkey. Passing it into the future eliminates the possibility of seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the writers decided that their film would be the last and that they could do whatever they wanted. This movie is totally out of line with the first two. And it did not even look like it was written by the same people who won 3. 3 at least they had humor and they could be easily seen by younger children. 4 is simply ugly and petty (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. I hated, I hated, I hated. I hated the fact that someone might like it and hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. I give this a start simply because IMDb.com does not let me give it a zero.
