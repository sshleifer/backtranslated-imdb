I read all the other comments that made this movie an excellent movie. I did not see anything of the excellence that was said. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to see it. The first time I fell asleep and the second time I arrived six minutes from the end and gave up. I guess it was mainly my fault that I entered with great expectation, but I do not think this would have ruined the film completely. The movie was simply bland. There was nothing spectacular or unique about it. The plot was not all bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue was forced and the film went on forever. I would not recommend watching this movie.
