This TVM seems to have polarized opinions among the commentators on this page, so maybe I can solve it by saying that this is a very stupid and not very well made television movie. How bad is it? It is a teleplay game that can not even decide what its name is because, while in the United States they call it LINDA, it is known in Britain as LUST FOR MURDER and it is generally a bad sign when a movie has to change its name. And I can also point out that it is not a mockery, as someone else said. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and I will say that the plot is rather solid. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple named Jeffries with whom they get along very well. They get along so well that they go on vacation together (Decide if there's a change of wife) and Paul sees his wife kill the Jeffries. After that, the plot takes an unexpected turn <br /> <br /> Writing the previous paragraph, I suddenly realized the great amount of potential that the story had and I will not say anything that takes it out of the premise. It's just that when the story continues after the events I've described, things become increasingly unlikely and strange. Not only that, but the production values ​​are quite impressive, since the actor who plays Paul Cowley makes a wooden voice that irritates, while most of the scenes, Exterior and Interior, seem to have been filmed in a day cloudy.
