Now I know that a lot of black humor makes fun of typical black things like, for example, gold teeth. But that does not mean they are always fun. Do not be a threat is an example of this. The urban film certainly lends itself to satire. The problem is that the Wayans and the consorts not only try to satirize the typical culture of the "ghetto", but also reject the valid affirmations that are made in urban films like Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. Personally I think that the creators of this film should move their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters. Besides this, the movie itself is terrible. It's not entirely funny. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the genre of the urban film, the filmmakers show their views of the urban 'ignorant' blacks (ghettos). Now there are other jokes in this movie, but I think this is the main reason. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is crap and the creators should use their talent to do a constructive comedy / satire. They have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was done before this movie) and on Friday.
