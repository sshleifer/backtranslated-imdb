(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the film, however, it can change the expectations of it and, therefore, make the experience less pleasant). <br /> <br /> Have you ever rented a scary movie, hoping to be on the edge of your seat with fear, and instead end up howling with laughter at every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and scare the viewer. He cut himself badly and jumped too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the bad construction of time throughout the plot discourages the spectator and makes the film more and more exhausting to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than the writers who abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that gradually they relied on cheap tactics to scare. The acting did not make it scary, and the situations barely made it scary, therefore, I needed some dark scenes with things jumping towards you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even the gore could have saved the plot, and it competes with the gore of the successful thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow the incredibly fascinating psychological theme of Se7en, but he failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and the structure of the plot surrounding the murderer's psychology. The initial scenes make the spectator think that it is a psychological thriller; Believe me, it's far from that. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the bad performance? At first, Cary Elwes seems to make a convincing performance; however, this deteriorates completely in the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left with tears of laughter in this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and widespread, although it is not as bad as Elwes', and the big red flag is that Whannell is also a writer of the film. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw could never make up for the fact that he lost half of that, and that is what makes him a great failure. It was a wasted opportunity, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to participate in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm mad at myself for wasting money just to rent it. It definitely was not worth the $ 4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything that has to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The great tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis for its plot, it is that the great potential story was discarded and the bad performance added insult to the injury. I will avoid the poor word games that involve the title and I will only conclude with this: do not watch this movie.
