As other reviewers have pointed out, this film is a cross between (that is, stolen from) stories we've seen before. Specifically, this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted in Mad Max. Remove the Clint cigar and replace with a cigarette; retire his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voil√†, an updated vagabond. In this film, the "hero" is even more blatantly a "Savior" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound in the left side, and his entrance to the city is preceded by a request of "salvation" by the inhabitants of the city, a reference quite transparent to a "Second Coming". I watched the movie on a hot, humid morning. Sleeping was impossible and when you got up at 4:30 am, there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. Although unoriginal, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the film is still something entertaining ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
