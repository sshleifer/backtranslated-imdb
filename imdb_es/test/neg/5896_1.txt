This documentary was very amateur. It could have been done by university students. Assuming it was, my rating is as follows. Content: C, Sound quality: F, Cinematography: F, Performance: D, Soundtrack: F, Cast: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall rating: D <br /> <br /> I found myself getting dizzy while we walked through the streets with the characters, going up and down with each movement of the cameraman's step. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the deaf dialogue. The extensive edition of postproduction and CGI did not help this bomb. These students would "barely" pass my course. My advice ... do not waste your time or money for the "A".
