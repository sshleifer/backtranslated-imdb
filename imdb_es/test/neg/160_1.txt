My God ... I have not seen such a horrible movie in a long time ... I saw it last night and I wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... Keira Knightley really tries hard in this, but she can not handle it. .. he left aside his accent from time to time and did not have the charisma to play the role ... the performance of sienna millers takes you to a point where you start to ask yourself: have you ever had acting classes? judging by the edge of love, he has never been in acting class, but should consider going in the near future ... both look very nice ... maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career ... if they can be actresses, everyone can!
