Ramsay ?? The kings of comedy (or it was horror, whatever) wake up after years of hibernation. And yes, I got scared. No, not because of the element of horror (of course I'm not that delicate), but because the rats danced constantly on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theater (where these films are most popular). <br /> <br /> So check the plot. A man is stabbed repeatedly, drowned, stuffed in plastic and thrown in a pool. But he still retaliates. Was the movie a thriller or a horror? That in itself is the suspense for you to discover. And the end turns out to be another mask of mystery. Do you remember those undercover agents of Ramsay? Men with great horror masks. Only here the mask is of a human. I guess no more details are required to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to be too dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between film and television. Aditi Gowitrikar, dressed cheaply and sparingly, in her typical pink lipstick, seems ... (Uh, you know what). <br /> <br /> The background score is a direct elevation of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It is not worth commenting on a single department of the film, neither technical nor creative. The novelty lacks both history and execution. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, Dhund confuses your senses.
