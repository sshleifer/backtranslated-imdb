Boring movie. Bad plot Poor actors. The movie happens in a room that is supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots, the blond patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There is something good in this movie (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that the media feed us every day into something real, the terrorists are Americans (or Western people if you wish). <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two parts. The first part of the film is about the journey of the Dutchman (15 seconds), while the second part is about staying in the incredible dark brown room (1 hour and a little). <br /> <br /> The Dutch boy is going to deliver the money in Morocco for some "charity organization", leaves the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped with another guy who is shot after saying "They will not shoot us". The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with an Arab type like Morpheus for so long that you will learn to play chess too! In the end, the Dutch boy reveals his plot not because they have cut four of his fingers, but because he was cheated by a game so unconvincing that you should see the movie. <br /> <br /> How good when you're so tired. I can not sleep
