The NBC should be ashamed. I would not allow my children to see this. I would definitely tell my church to stay away. This movie is a test of why NBC has always been a third-category network. The producers, actors and writers must get on their knees and ask God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not parade on the deck of the ark. The ark did not have a mallet. Lot was not even born when this event took place. Did someone attached to this project try to read the Bible? More than two animals of each type were taken. Read the story in Genesis. How could someone bring this to any screen, small or large?
