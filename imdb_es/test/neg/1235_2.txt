I will give it a second chance, but I was very disappointed in the first one. It would not serve a candle to the other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogues that do not add to the story at all. I agree with the others that it does not seem to develop a story that is interesting. It's slow and laborious and I only know what the Comanches plan to do. Maybe everything will come together in the second installment, but I'll have to force myself to see it and find out. I am from the Apache heritage of the Texas / New Mexico area but I do not recognize much of what is happening. Maybe I do not know the facts, but this is not doing much to educate me.
