This movie made me see Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I'm not even going to dream of comparing Requiem with any of the Alien or Predator films, this is a HORRIBLE TEENAGER B-HORROR IN A SMALL CITY OF ANY CITY THAT DOES NOT WORRY. at least there were lots of hand-made art carved into the movie sets, had bags of candy that had not been seen before in any of the original movies, but was ruined by unconvincing characters / acting. <br /> <br /> Requiem misbehaves acting at the lowest level you can imagine, and also lacks all other departments ... it is a sacrilege to include alien costumes and predators in this type of garbage.
