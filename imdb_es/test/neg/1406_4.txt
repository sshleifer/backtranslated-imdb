Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they will see stories about dysfunctional families that have come to expect them and that it is increasingly challenging to keep them fresh, but here, despite the good distribution, it seems more than what's going on. same. The story is about the Travis family that is trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who retires from all and has never treated his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch), as well as Matt, but communicates (of some kind) with his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) who finds his hiding place of Olla and begins to smoke it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men like the cashier at the grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana, she is arrested and taken to jail. She does not tell anyone what happened, but she does discover bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has been absent from work. After all this, Sandy becomes ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he may have to accept the loss of another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris, who has worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" and also on the upcoming Superman movie, and although his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing his pain and confusion, the story (for me) has too many things. The script touches so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of all of them, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, abandonment, experimentation with homosexuality and a disease that threatens the lifetime. If all those scenarios were not enough for you, Harris then follows a plot twist at the end that is supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. While I turned my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script continued to uncoil one thing after another, I must admit that I did not hate this movie and I must recognize the actors for that. We all have at least one good scene somewhere in the movie, but I wish the story had focused more on Weaver and his character than Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and, with a more defined script, could have had a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination, but instead we have endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. Harris demonstrates that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he simply throws so many different things at the audience that the material becomes laborious and artificial.
