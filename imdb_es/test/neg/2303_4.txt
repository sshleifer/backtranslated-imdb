Nicknamed beyond comprehension, the HBO version of Lumumba is a disastrous representation of what appears to be a decent movie. Some scenes simply do not make sense in English and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading. Add self-censorship that involves CIA agent Frank Carlucci, and you will have a movie stripped of its drama and power. We hope that the subtitled version will reach US television screens at some point.
