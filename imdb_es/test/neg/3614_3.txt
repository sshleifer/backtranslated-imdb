A large variety of snakes cause an uprising of tourists who "invade" their island due to the damage of their captain's ship. The few remaining survivors who are not surprised by the snakes will try an escape mission, their objective is to flee to the available boats that can safely remove them from the island. <br /> <br /> Presented with the injected doses of visual humor with many snake gags, SNAKE ISLAND by Wayne Crawford presents many different breeds of slithery predators, in surprising position, ready to attack their prey. The star William Katt, as an author investigating snakes for a forthcoming novel, has fun in his role along with writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (... as the captain of a tourist ship) as heroes who put themselves face to face. crisis. Kate Connor is the love appeal of Crawford, a vacation attorney. The other cast members serve as tourists or crew, mainly fodder for snakes. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, director Crawford presents snakes live with computer generated, and the violence is really docile. Crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera like the eyes of the snake when facing the potential victim (... with the actor looking directly into the camera). It should never be taken seriously, the ironic approach was probably the best way to photograph SNAKE ISLAND because the premise is too ridiculous to accept on its own. <br /> <br /> Effects and suspense scenes rarely work because Crawford often can not successfully perform sequences in which humans confront snakes. Snake attacks on themselves never occur on the screen (... one or two upper parts), or are so limited that they leave little impression. That's a no-no for a genre like this. Katt fans will probably want to take a look because he provides a facial comedy that sets the general tone of certain scenes in which he must defend against snakes. CGI scenes in which we see a lot of snakes in a general area are not very effective, which eliminates the realism Crawford may have tried to establish. There are a lot of better horror movies with snakes as aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, relegated to a scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day with the bubbly, not knowing what danger lies ahead.
