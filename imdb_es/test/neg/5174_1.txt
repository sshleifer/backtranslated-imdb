When I saw this movie, all I could think about was, maybe it got better, but after 20 minutes I could not see it a second longer. I do not want too many lines about this, but it's really a complete waste of time. All the actors say that this is true. If you're still going to see it, do not say I did not warn you. Maybe if you're a hooligan or something, you might think it's a tribute to your hobby. again .. Cinema is a term that covers individual films, the field of cinema as an art form and the film industry. Movies are produced by recording images of the world with cameras or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. .
