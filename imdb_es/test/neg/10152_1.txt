I'm not even going to comment on what piece of garbage this movie is since it has already been established. However, seeing this with my friends, we all laughed out loud when the leading girl made a reference to Shelley Hack while talking on the phone. We sit there trying to figure out why the writer would put it in the mix. We can only assume that he had a fixation of Charlie's Angels at once. Based on that reference, we assume that this movie must have been made around his Charlie's Angels career in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here, it was done around 1987. Surely you could not say that for the basses production values. It seems that it was made by a university student for a film class. And although I would not expect a low-budget garbage festival like this to be politically correct, the imbeciles of this movie liked to direct derogatory homosexual comments between them. Even so, I would only classify this as the second worst horror film ever made, in second place only after "Nail Gun Massacre".
