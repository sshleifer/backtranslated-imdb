I had not read any of the books or seen the first movie, so, after receiving passes for a preview show, I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> 'Angels and Demons' was a confusing and convoluted film that lacked direction or something like that. credibility There was very little character development and I never worried about the difficult situation of the protagonists; otherwise it was true, he was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed, since the first half of the film focused almost exclusively on why the Illuminati are who they are. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from one place to another. location with little explanation or reason and hopes that the viewer believes that everyone in the film is an ally when they meet for the first time. Any analytical mind will realize that this is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely clich√© and leaves you wondering what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very studded and unnecessary. <Br /> <br /> The actors are not particularly credible in their roles, mainly because I found it hard to believe that the scientists, professors and men of the church acted the way they do without taking into account the consequences of their actions . The events that happen are not plausible in the least and the pace of the film is questionable, the characters jump from one side to another and I have to wonder how the protagonists manage to get from one place to another on time, all the time. <Br /> <br /> The most pleasant part of the film is cinematography, it seemed like a beautiful movie to watch, but it was a disaster, I discovered that it would not be worth paying it in theaters.
