Actually, I am not narrating the main plot in this commentary, but with only 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK, here are these: <br /> <br /> The speed is just an 85% conversion of Hollywood flick Cellular in Bollywood using the Vikram Bhatt software. The title does not match the story, it just goes in the direction of the thriller. Only that!! It does not deserve a single star for its imitation, the imperfect launch, the poor standard and the predictable history. Undoubtedly, I can now say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his status as a director, since no mature audience will appreciate his recent works, including this one. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani has also become a comic book character. Who knows how long it will last longer in the film industry? Sometimes, the standard in the presentations and the cinematography are seen lower than in a film of degree C. But the paper of greater support carried out it Zayed Khan, that was something identical to the paper of Chris Evan like Ryan in Cellular. With an innocent face, Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the film since he has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already seen Cellular, I advise you never to waste time with this imitation bag.
