I saw this movie with the strength of the only positive criticism and I can only imagine that that guy is a shilling. <br /> <br /> The performance of the female lead is actually quite good, but the whole movie is very unbearable. Bored I could barely stand to sit through him. This is the very definition of boredom. <br /> <br /> Until now, this movie is rated 8 out of 10 in 7 votes. That should mean that the director, the director's girlfriend, the producer, the actress and the drinking friends have given their own movie a 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who just want to entertain or Enjoy a good story, avoid this. <br /> <br /> This man on the street will give you a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Note from the FDA: While this movie can be used as an assistant to get good nights sleep, no medicinal value is implied or offered.
