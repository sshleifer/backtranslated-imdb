This movie was in a box with another 20, with variable quality, and I can safely say that this title was right at the end of the pile. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense to go through the plot, what there was of that, selecting what was wrong, since I do not have all day and life is too short, which reminds me that I just of losing about 85 minutes of mine to see this gut. <br /> <br /> The acting was devilishly bad in a way that made it fun, if only fairly, while the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any fan of Laurel and Hardy moan. One of the few funny moments was when the protagonist made a joke about her plastic T * ts of her old friends, which would have been fine if she had not had to see them move when she moved on the screen. > <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and he probably deserves it for having Heather Thomas, since she was sexy and well-formed, although her performance was as bad as everyone else's.
