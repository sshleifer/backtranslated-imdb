*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There's not much to say about this movie from the era of the first talkies. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" a "movie," because I feel the word is too esoteric). But what can be said about it ... mainly speaks against it. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the excessive use of portraying the Indians as bad people. In one scene, the toddler of the main character in the film, a domineering and over-ambitious family man who wants to establish a newspaper business, is playing outside his father's office. An Indian kneels in front of the child. "Hello," the boy tells the Indian, in a very polite way. The Indian gives him a pen, gets up and walks away. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. runs enthusiastically inside the office. "Mommy mommy!" Shout, holding the gift of the Indian. "Look what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" she replies to the boy "Never talk to those filthy Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) appears as a man who speaks with forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a definite plan to give his family a better life. But, soon we discovered, is not a great winner, much less a man of totally good mentality. His slave son, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a revealing sign of this. <br /> <br /> On the first trip of his family to a church service on Sunday morning, one <br /> <br /> in which Curiously, Cravat is to give the sermon: Isaiah tries to come , dressed as Cravat, long tail suit, holster, gun and all. Tie tells him to go home. "Does not everyone want me to go with the church?" Isaiah says with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Tie corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "You do not understand, I want you to stay and watch the house, and if someone shows up ... you shoot him!" <br /> <br /> The characters, not to mention the actors - in "Cimarron" could not <br /> <br /> act out of the burlap sacks, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too commendable, either. (Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver, known for playing the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, also released in 1931) manages to look good, while playing a pompous old lady, which is what she likes the most . -known by.) But, apart from that, well ... <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates is not popular in the city since the first week she arrives, <br /> <br /> and one of the the outlaws decide to remove the white hat to Cravat when he and his wife (Irene Dunne) walk casually. Despite his anger at the man who fired the bullet, Cravat simply takes it easy. <br /> <br /> Not only this story was not "the search for realism", but it was very <br /> <br /> lacking several key areas: for example, Cravat's newspaper never really looks . (Bulletins and posters, yes, but not any newspaper). <br /> <br /> However, it may be the strangest of all: it is located in a small town in <br /> <br /> Kansas. However, for some reason or another, Yancy Cravat is stuck in <br /> <br /> calling his article "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam". <br /> <br /> The really good westerns have always been very few and far between: the only exceptions are the so-called "spaghetti westerns" by Clint Eastwood from the late 60s to the early 70s. Cliché westerns, by On the other hand, they are a dime. <br /> <br /> If you like western clichés, "Cimarron" will make you feel proud, but, as for me ... I was ashamed. <br /> <br />
