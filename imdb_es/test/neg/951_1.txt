Since this TSS program (screen savers) was changed to AOTS (program attack), it has gone downhill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. It made the show unbelievable, then they were fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the program changed to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about games and magazines. He also promoted bands that no one had ever heard of or cared about. Finally I could not see it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went to do his thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several pod models online, and programs, etc. in the REV network 3. Take a look. REV3.com I think you can access www.systm.org. If you want a real technology program instead of Aots, go see the Kevin Roses programs or listen to the tWit podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
