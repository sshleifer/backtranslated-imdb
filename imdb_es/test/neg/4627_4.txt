YOUR PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> Two lucky club revelers (Laurel and Hardy) can not pay their bill, which provokes a violent punishment from a bad-tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> Typical L & H scenario, less substantial than some of Your best work of this period, but it's worth taking a look. Stan occupies the center of the stage this time, trapped in a financial dilemma after retaining part of his salary to finance a night in the city, only to discover it, too late! - that his aggrieved wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his hiding place with worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's prolonged close-ups as she slowly realizes the disaster unfolding reveal her genius for characterization and mime. The morality of 1920 is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who plays an ax-faced busy body who is happy to alert the respective wives of L & H (Holderness and Lyle Taho) about the bad behavior of their husbands. The ending fades, but the film still has a lot to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
