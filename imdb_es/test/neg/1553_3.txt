I had to watch this for my Canadian film course and was told that it was considered the "best Canadian movie". When I saw this I really did not agree, considering that I have seen many better ones. I understand that there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) did not really care what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to annoy the viewers. This movie shows a little about the history of Quebec. It is not a very interesting movie; It definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal.
