The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple: it is a board game called Mamba, where players die in real life in the same way they die in the game. The scenes of death that open include murders through computer generated crabs and snakes. cardboard and deliberately annoying and there is not a little bit of suspense. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but it's completely wasted and it's not memorable here. The climax with CGI-witch that comes from the sea is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles plus the sexy Eliza Dushku. If those movies are the future of horror, then I really give up. Give me any low-budget horror movie from the 70s or 80s on this modern piece of Shit. A generous 3 out of 10.
