With the Terrible performance, the horrible dialogue, the crowd in a bad mood, the horrible plot and the terrible movie. This has to be the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I'm the king of finding bad movies. For the purposes, they simply threw fake blood on people and things, did not spend time to create wounds and make the special effects worthwhile. Most people who make low-budget horror movies, at least, do something like layers of fabric or something to make a heartbreaking wound. The dialogue was far from even decent and the action was without direction or effort. They just released some actors on a set and they said, they have it. I swear I've seen better movies from my movie at school. How did this get a DVD release?
