Although he only made his first film in Australia and went to Britain and then to the United States to continue his career, the Australians will tell him that the best movie star they produced was Errol Flynn. I am not sure that he has ever returned to Australia after his great success in Captain Blood. Still, I attribute this film to the well-known Australian irreverence for destroying the reputation of one of their own. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem in telling the story of Errol Flynn's life was that he told enough stories in his life. to the end in his memoirs, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that a lot of the film was based on that and the reading between the lines of that book. <br /> <br /> The infidelity of his mother towards his father was not written, but it could be inferred when reading My Wicked Bad Paths. He did not particularly like the woman, that is clear from some sources. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie had dealt more with his adventures in New Guinea, which for me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As for your street fight in the Depression, I tend not to believe that. Even if I had succeeded in that, I guarantee that a sufficient amount of that would have ruined his appearance and that he would never have had a career as a leader. <br /> <br /> Still the people below seem to think that Sydney's atmosphere during the Depression was well captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American audiences know him better as the tense but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential who left the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
