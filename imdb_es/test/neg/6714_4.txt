"The Foreigner" is a story of foreign intrigue with Seagal in the center as a deep coverage agent who has a package that everyone wants and is willing to kill to get it. The film lacks inspiration with less than the usual actions of action that put Seagal on the map of the film (combats, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, acrobatics, etc.) and more than one complicated story, uninteresting and full of filling without meaning. The action that is seen there is symbolic and free while Seagal, which looks more and more like a pork chop, meanders through this insipid film without expression and bored, while not showing any improvement in the ability to act. Somewhere around "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below", Seagal's films were submerged and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of that trend. There's nothing worth seeing here, except for the Seagal fans. (DO-)
