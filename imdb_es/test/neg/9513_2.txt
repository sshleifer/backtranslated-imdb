This is by far the worst version of the tragic masterpiece of William Shakespeare that I have seen in my life. It seems that the filmmakers did not really read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is out of service and reduced to its simple necessity, however, there is time for Olivier and Queen Gertrudis to suggest an incest created by Olivier. Could we have had the "Something rotten in the state of Denmark" bit in its place? Casting is another issue. I understand that the very superior Branagh film had its weak parts (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is obsolete. Mel Gibson's creepy stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he's saying. It seems that many of the actors have just memorized the paper: they know less about what is said than sophomores in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, consult Kenneth Branagh or even Lawerence. Olivier To be honest, even the Disney Hamlet is better.
