Okay, admitted, I'm a fan of low-budget horror, that along with it, comes the piece of occasional junk that even the most hardcore fan of country movies can not stand to witness ... TRANCERS 6, directed by Jay Woelfel of DEMONICUS. <br /> <br /> First of all, the TRANCERS series, which began in the mid-80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise that is due to Tim Thomerson and his excellent acting. of the trancer hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and low, due to the collapse of the budgets of the characteristics of the Full Moon (which, despite what people have said, have actually brought very high quality features, such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING) , Thomerson did not return for the sixth Full Moon writer, Courtney Joyner, returns once again and delivers another below-average script, which features Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted ... a different hairstyle like every time it is shown to you, and a little "shemp" lying on a table, going down the line towards your daughter's body ... Well, from now on, you have "Jo Deth" acting like Jack ... but it's a shame that she does not really emit the same presence on the screen as Jack Deth did. <br /> <br /> The film, shot on 16 mm, is simply a shame for the name TRANCERS ... without offending anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I respect you for wanting to jump and make a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (although it was filmed since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> However, check out the Full Moon DVD, which is a double feature with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers of the last 10 Full Moon features. <br /> <br /> In general, I probably would have liked to include more if I did not have the name TRANCERS, but like everything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you should check it out for yourself.
