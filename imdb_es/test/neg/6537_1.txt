Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow movie with three essentially good actors who improvise the most banal dialogue I have ever heard. This is another road movie that really is not going anywhere. Frequently, the camera is out of focus and the constant movement in some of the prolonged scenes is annoying. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive but nice. The cast also establishes what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the word "dude". (Even Howard Stern has abandoned this tired ponderous pronoun.) <br /> <br /> The three main actors and one supporting actor are great promise. They are clearly comfortable and courageously let themselves be represented as superficial and even ridiculous. All the characters' actors seem to be brave amateurs who generously offered to speak a few lines ... In fact, they all fit well with their roles. . This is one of my ten worst movies of all time.
