I'm not sure what to say / think about this movie. Definitely not the worst of the series (there is still "Halloween 3"). The style is very different and focuses on other elements than its predecessor. Try to explain why Michael Myers goes crazy on Halloween and starts killing. Well, all those things about Michael Myers' curse and the cult of evil was a good effort, but I did not buy it. None of the other installments in the series tried to give extravagant explanations. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a lot of blood. Actually it is a simple butcher shop. If you have not seen the other Halloween movies, you probably like it for its blood content. But for a true Halloween fan, this sequel might be too different to be seen as a good one. The suspense became terror and killing (explosive heads ..., you find out). <br /> <br /> The ending (theatrical cut) is simply horrible. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then beaten with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, and then beaten a little more until his head slime (where does this green thing come from?). Basically, it is nothing more than a garbage that is worth 5 million dollars. <br /> <br /> However, there was something good: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, a real misfortune. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
