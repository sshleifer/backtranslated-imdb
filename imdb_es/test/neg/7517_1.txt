This movie is a shame. How can you take one of the best science fiction stories of all time and turn it into a kind of half love story? The whole beginning of the film was not in the history of H.G. Wells and he did not have to be. The Eloi, too, became completely wrong. They built houses or formed any kind of real society. They did not care about each other at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world without difficulties or complex emotions. They were barely aware of the Morlocks. I do not know why this movie was made the way it was made, but some stories must be told as they are or left alone.
