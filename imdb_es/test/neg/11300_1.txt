I have witnessed some movie atrocities. In the last couple of years, it seems that the producers and directors are bent on making films that bring me closer and closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I did not expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying "The book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be something other than garbage. But what I came to see was a movie that made all the other bad movies look better in comparison. <br /> <br /> Usually, when I watch a terrible movie, I find myself more fun than anything else. Unfortunately, however, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a movie that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise, I suppose. I had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And to lead, was Ridley Scott. There have been films with much less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much that I would have cut out of this movie that I doubt there was anything left. It was pathetic. The story was so ridiculous that it seemed that a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even more insane, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie in which <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** <br /> <br /> Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked to pieces. That scene, more than any other, made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was a joke of more than two hours. This movie should only be seen, if people want to learn not to write a good movie.
