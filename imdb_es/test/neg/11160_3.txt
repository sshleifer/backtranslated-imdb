Arnold fans will scream with joy, the brainless action fans will scream in amazement, and Catholics will just scream. <br /> <br /> Written illogically by Andrew W. Marlowe and directed by Peter Hyams, * End of Days * takes The Terminator out of its open-back hospital gown (the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to the big screen after his heart operation), while exploiting things in mysterious ways and blaspheming in biblical verse to give Catholics something more to mourn. <br /> <br /> It's 1999 and those who pronounce themselves in the live world live in fear that their computers will go crazy and lose their downloaded porn. Even as Y2K's stinky tech kills the streets of New York, the former policeman turned alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the impeccable story of "dead wife and child" for the Loose Cannon effect), must challenge the theory Waters to save the virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) of 20 years of being recruited as? wait for that ?? The bride of Satan. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity ensues. <br /> <br /> For every anti-hero, there is your anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here? and he is partying as if he were 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Antichrist between 11 pm and 12 midnight on December 31, 1999. Ironically, at the time when all porn will be lost ? in this way causing the end of the days. Being able to read minds, conjure up hallucinations and use unlimited magic, Satan does not think to accelerate the process of impregnation by appearing months in advance and courting Christine as a teenage model and then closing the pant raid easily at the agreed time; instead, he appears on December 28 as a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why he does not receive it with his thighs open. (See the previous comment about stupidity). Here is a film where nothing makes sense the moment it is pronounced, much less after contemplating its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' face down with a '1' in front. So, wait, is the Prince the Antichrist? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze chases Jericho and Christine (J and C? Can they get it?) In the city, they never do anything that really precipitates their capture. In one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and son to tempt him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply into Jericho's mind when he recreates his family with nuances enough to inspire nostalgia, why can not he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make a murderer without a tongue speak, but he can not make the killer take out a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan point-blank, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt and reveal the wounds that are closed, so that Jericho does not worry excessively about Satan's health, is not he sanitary to deal with gunshot wounds? open? In fact, instead of simply possessing Jericho to approach Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much unnecessary energy on parallel projects (crucifying the tongueless man, flying the Jericho companion (Kevin Pollak) and then saving him, and then exploiting him again , fighting ridiculously against Jericho when he could crush him with the effort of thought) we wonder if a more efficient killer / lover should not be put in the case? Say, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most valuable about * End of Days * are Arnold's valiant attempts at the Method: "sad" means to roll your eyes and not drop anything with a foreign accent; "depressed" means bringing a bottle to your lips and not letting go of anything with a strange accent; "Deadly fear" means expanding your eyes and not letting go of anything with a foreign accent. There is definitely a pattern here, if only we could decipher it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the devil is dispatched not by the holy men to whom Catholics pray for the liberation of apocalypse like these, but by the atheist Jericho. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort "faith" and tremble in their cells doing nothing about Satan walking among them, the Prince of Darkness is frustrated by a nullification with a big gun and a foreign accent. What clearly says something that Catholics refuse to listen to blindly: that even if the Devil existed, those who have been indoctrinated to fear it unconditionally and irrationally could not evoke a belief in its fall, much less act accordingly. In addition, they may not really want to be defeated, since only through their opposite polarity does the existence of their god become sustainable. <br /> <br /> Because it is written in the Book of Revelations: "And the Prince of Darkness will descend on Earth without any solid game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date that will have no meaning until that the Gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopt the numbering of the day that will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax that will annoy sensible people for millennia, by the time Christians have forgotten the actual birth date of Christ and They have appropriated the pagan festival of Saturnalia instead, and will the Prince effect a Revolution through tight purple pants and members of the ambiguous lesbian band? I can believe that the people were drained of blood and crucified, and that the alcoholic was built like a Mr. Universe, I can believe that a giant and supernatural monster can not kill an armed guy with only a foreign accent, I can even believe that the devil needs to perform some 13th-century Celtic druid rituals as a prelude, but what I can not believe is the 20-year-old virgin from New York City in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially around Prince ...
