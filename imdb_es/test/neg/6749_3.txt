This movie was filmed and recorded in 1987, but it did not hit theaters until 1990. While I watched it, I could see the good intentions I had, but I'm afraid there was not much talent or experience behind the camera. To make it work. The story takes place in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are told to leave their land for a railroad to cross. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who offered money for the land but was rejected. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to leave and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their lands. Berrigan becomes impatient and hires a group of thugs to force everyone to evict. These thugs are headed by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he does not hesitate to kill anyone who causes him problems. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) swears to seek revenge and recover the land for all. Marco blows up the bridge that the railroad would need, they also destroy a tunnel, which delays the project for several months and Berrigan now begins to receive heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip to Bountiful", has, at most, an irregular career in directing. He is a good actor, but here it seems that he is above his head. This was a movie that desperately needed more attention to detail and it's easy to see that it did not happen. Roberts' hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but it's supposed to be 1890! The director of photography is Toyomichi Kurita, who ended up being a good cameraman, but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time. It is not a clear-looking film and I noticed in several shots during the day that the sun was slipping by something and the scenes simply do not have the sharpness that would have helped the overall appearance. The script is just a story of revenge and there are no surprises during the course of the film. We know that Giannini will get it and it seemed only a matter of time. The cast is top notch and they do the best they can, but the whole movie seems to have no inspiration. This was promoted as Julia Roberts' film debut, but I'm not sure it's correct. She could have appeared in a movie called "Firehouse" before this.
