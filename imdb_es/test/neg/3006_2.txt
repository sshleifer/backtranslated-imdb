If this movie had a point I never discovered it. A very depressing movie that purportedly deals with the final evacuation of residents living in the area of ​​a dam on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no real Northfork River in Montana. There are several bifurcations of the north, but they are branches of other rivers that are divided into the north and south bifurcations. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the film is a coffin that moves towards the surface of the lake, but the scene is never tied in history and the spectator is left speculating as to its meaning. But much remains to the speculation of the viewer in the film. Another example is when a team of employees of the dam responsible for the evacuation of residents arrives at the headquarters of the dam, another group of people is leaving. Some observation that is almost inaudible is made about these people, which does not make any sense and there is no follow-up in the movie to explain it. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into several stories and the film keeps changing again and Entre histories which is quite disconcerting. And stories are rare. In one of them, the occupants of a property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a house built like Noah's Ark. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and, somehow, is. sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If someone can find out what the ghost story was about, the author should have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The landscape was austere and the sun never shines. There are snowy mountains in the distance. I guess the purpose was to establish the mood. The time period is established by the fact that all evacuees were driving Ford sedans from the 1946-48 era, although the events were supposed to have occurred in 1955. The performance was mediocre. When I saw the billing for this movie, he said that Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If it was, I did not recognize it, but I guess it was the ghost lady.
