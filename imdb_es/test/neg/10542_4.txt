Oh darling! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was very disappointed. I was thinking ... A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We can watch him kick people, turn people around and break bones. We could even see him fight with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I expected a rude awakening. This film can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of Team A, remove the adorable characters and rogues like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then, ask a writer / director to write an argument that Ed Wood would be ashamed of and too fanatical about The Matrix and John Woo movies for their own good. Launch a group of people with a really bad acting ability and who do not have real names. Finally, add a main star that is becoming loose around the stomach and that no longer seems to be able to do its own stunts. <br /> <br /> The result? Dead past An action movie so ridiculous that at least it made me smile. The holes in the plot are great, dazzlingly large, for example, the prisoners who, when the jail is invaded, fight against the invaders instead of trying to escape. Or how about the prison, which has an armory containing heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (which looks a lot like an Huey) with a kind of video game machine mounted on the nose. <br /> <br /> Then there is Seagal himself. I like the boy He can fight Even he is witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But throughout the movie I kept waiting for that great defining fight scene. It never happened. Instead, we got people to shoot many weapons and not hit hell much. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and shoots a sub-machine gun, there are not many places where bullets can go beyond the corridor and toward the target. However, somehow they get lost? Even Team A would shudder at this nonsense. And then, when it comes to any kind of physical things one by one, we are treated to a Matrix scam in poor condition, without the benefit of bullet time. People who kick twenty feet in the air and several other absurd and acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> Come on, Steven, you're better than this. Your career can not end. Say it's not like that! <br /> <br /> This is instantly forgettable (except that I force myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you see it, try to find it fun in an A- Team type of way. But I doubt it's high on anyone's "verifiable" list. Out of justice this is not. More like going out to lunch.
