Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've seen. Obviously this is not intentional. The main characters take about half of the film to realize that what is in the middle of the city is throwing red and hot things, and the other half went to divert the flow of cans through the city using fire trucks (a the right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like an actor of RSC. It's amazing that films like this are commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone approaching an active volcano and filming it, and that would probably cost around Â£ 20. ($ 40) I can see a guy who presents the movie to a movie company "well, there's a big VOLCANO and it erupts in a CITY ... quite radical, hey "If you can find it in the containers of dollars, it might be worth buying later. Seeing this majority of the other movies would look good.
