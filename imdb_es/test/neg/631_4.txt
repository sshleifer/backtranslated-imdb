It is not a terrible movie ... But there are monstrous scenes in which you will be rolling on the floor laughing, which is not good for an action thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator UU., And Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal figure. The special effects are good, "special", for example, the external train shots are, obviously, a model train. <br /> <br /> Goofs: A meteor hits a stationary car in the initial scene. The car explodes in flames but does not move an inch. After the impact, the meteor is in the upper part of the car's hood, impossible because of the low angle reached by the meteor. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good portion of the events in the film are predictable, from the helicopter crash ("Pull up, pull up!") to the the fact that annoying people get it in the end, until the classic bridge over a 1000-foot gorge waiting for the train. to the continuation of the configuration at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenes that show the aliens attacking are very funny. They are vicious and cute dolls and move at the speed of light: do you remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In a scene, four people who shoot clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the film, Todd Bridges rides a mini flamethrower that he uses to send a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his own hands.
