** from **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my grandmother's favorite number of deceased and the year she was born , 23 Minutes after the hour 23. Assign the number of the form you choose and ooh, you will be very scared. I will be EXTREMELY scared when I launch a 23 brain-dead dog, and has Schumacher's last attempt at a dark suspense festival with The Number 23. Oh yes, 23 is also my raven record in my favorite Street dive 23 in state 23 in the union. <br /> <br /> Carrey takes the film almost half the way, then we lose sight of it, not caring much. Do not look for crazy expressions of comedian Carrey, as you've seen in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And do not expect an incarnation of a character like he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar development for Jimbo. Where is The Riddler when you need it? I know, we do not need it. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underused as the supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. Her talent, like Carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to see her try to rescue her undeveloped character almost from anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give credit where the credit is due, there are a couple of interesting scenes in The Number 23 that show a very astute cinematography. They are arresting enough for themselves without having to be twisted inside the incoherent narrative of this silly story. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you (and I realize that this is a work of absolute fiction) but I do not know anyone who reads his novel often in a dark and damp basement, or who spends his time in cemeteries regularly as Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and gloomy and rainy and with smoke and gloomy and rainy and wet and over and over and over again from start to finish. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more light, and we're talking about medicine students obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you feel like watching this movie, even if it's out of place. Just curiosity ... make sure you do it while you enjoy 23 naps, in this way you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
