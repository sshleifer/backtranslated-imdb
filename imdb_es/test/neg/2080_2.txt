Tempest is based on Shakespeare's classic work of the same name, but it is little like his source material. <br /> <br /> It disguises itself as as cerebral as its namesake, but instead it is a jumble, convoluted and trite. Exercise in tedium. The original proved the premise that people have a bad side, which would be destructive if left unchecked. Here he just got an error in the life of half of life (yawn) that makes everything go wrong in his personal and professional life. He is given a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his surroundings; in other words: to get away with it. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something in his pathetic life goes wrong, he finds an isolated place and begins to babble "Show me the magic!" while waving his hands around and makes an expression of "serious concentration". Because of the way these scenes are recorded, it seems that he is trying to convert errors into other types of errors. Turning a spider into a cockroach, maybe, but at this point, you really do not care. <br /> <br /> The story has him escaped from his life with his daughter to a Greek island somewhere, and then has a clumsy relationship with a girl he knows, one of the most boring romances ever committed to the cinema . The story simply gets stuck and moves at a slower and slower pace. You are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone. <br /> <br /> I will give you a 2 for the beautiful location in Greece and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is not clear whether the storm brought power this end over or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other films; A notable example is "Forbidden Planet", which gave credit to how power gets out of control. <br /> <br /> As for this "Tempest", its only magic is to cure insomnia.
