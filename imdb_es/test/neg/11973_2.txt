Woohoo! Here comes another scarecrow movie straight to the video to keep movie masochists happy. If the opening credits of economic appearance do not tell you that a good trip awaits you, then the diabolically tragic "writing" surely will. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is tied to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation into the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes crazy and starts firing people. Do I need to say more? This film is largely composed of economic effects that make it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that it is a creepy color reversal) and actors who apparently were not good enough to appear on a nighttime Cinemax special. Actually, that's not fair, since the actors did not have much space to work around the abysmal script. Some parts of this movie really seem parody, especially when a character takes his guitar and begins to play the worst song ever conceived by humans, with the worst lip synchronization ever made. The "gore" here is also a big disappointment. In most B-movies like this one, there's a thick layer of cheap FX gore to make up for what history and acting lack. Here, the material is so cheap that it is not even fun. Actually, this movie makes "Jack Frost 2" look very funny in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst you've seen", you probably have not delved into The World of B-horror straight to the video. In any case, this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish, regardless of your background.
