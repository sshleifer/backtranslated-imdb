CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the film, it is announced that the bridge collapsed only a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was in vain. Actually, taking the bridge in Remagen was the last important victory for the Western allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies tried to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge should only last one day after being captured. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a great protective force to the other side, and then they could start building a series of pontoon bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant that the end of the war was near and would not last all summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was announced with jubilation by the troops that did it. They knew how vital the battle was. <br /> <br /> This movie has little to do with the real story. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it occurred.
