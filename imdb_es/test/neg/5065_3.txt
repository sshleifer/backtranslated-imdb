The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who also made the divers fall into the ruin of Estonia, organized this silly "thriller" to save her investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, of course, is always visible, but he is only in three scenes. Deliver your material perfectly, as you can ask a professional. In addition, the main leader, JÃ¼rgen Prochnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is, however, bad. The actress who plays the Swedish minister (or whatever it is, does not seem to be in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some pretty ideas, and the story is quite interesting. However, the final script should have been rewritten a couple of times more. Some scenes are simply ridiculous, especially the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes. Presented as a 60-minute television movie, this could have been really interesting. As a two-hour feature, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and just plain silly. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe could be a good journalist (her ideas about the governments that use Estonia to transport military goods from Estonia to Sweden have been concluded). As it is true recently, when the Swedish army officially said that they used the Estonian boat for this, but as a film producer it stinks. <br /> <br /> The director, the writer and the actors suck more. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given it a 1, if it were not for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, Donald Sutherland is in it and has real footage. <br /> <br /> But we do not. I do not even see the ship sinking! What kind of movie about a sinking ship is that? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
