Yes, my summary almost says it all. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, give it a try. But not for pleasure. For studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and "cool" at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think they know everything, they are stupid and eventually they go crazy. The magnificent women. Etc. This is especially offensive, when all the characters are so terrible and stereotyped. I mean, it's okay, "Cody" was funny at one time or another, but unlike other "stupid characters" like Woody on Cheers or Joey on Friends, he does not have good lines. His stupidity is cast in a "duude" way, which becomes quite annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The morale of the family is horrible. Everything for the family. The mother and the father are supreme dictators, who between the severe punishment and the upbringing of the old-fashioned children, constantly say that they "love" their children, and then, of course, the children love to make them * barf *. <br /> <br /> Y: There is always a "sensitive point" like the one that is compressed into the "action", where the lessons of American morality (c) (tm) are imposed on the spectators, on sex ( In a mature stage, you can not have sex before you are 18 (!!), kind of way), or drugs. Even the habits of the church are described in detail here. The whole concept is directly disgusting, all done in a half way to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank, lock them up and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So, with issues ranging from disgusting religious propaganda, I think it's fair to conclude as I did in my subject ...
