It's hard to get excited about this horrible cartoon epic that, for some reason, has become a cult classic. Certainly, it can not be because of the totally artificial aspect of the set designs or the limpid performance of a stellar cast. These days it is shown too often on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> It hurts me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are involved in this fuzzy science fiction parody, none of which sounds. true. It's like watching an expensive budget spent on a Saturday afternoon children's show filled with cardboard characters and an unconvincing dialogue. It is a comic version of the novel by Jules Verne. <br /> <br /> The maturation of Fontaine was still attractive but it has an expression of pain on his face, perhaps regretting having accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script. She contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard paper, but an uncomfortable and imperial presence and looks totally out of place most of the time. Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and, above all, Peter Lorre, and Frankie Avalon, who sings the melody of the title that can not become anyone's favorite melody, are no better. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience when sitting in a movie like this that wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to the intelligence of almost everyone. Totally unconvincing from start to finish. The film, like the fantastic submarine, sinks deep into the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a sad conclusion.
