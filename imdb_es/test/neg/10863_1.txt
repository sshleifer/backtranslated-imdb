This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List". Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green lighting a P.O.S. So, regardless of the friendships involved, it's bad business. Larry Bishop must stay away from a movie camera at all costs. The writer / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project to the south, "Hell Ride" allows good actors to chew the stage ... at least when the camera is not focused on Bishop's weak attempts to steal all the scenes in which he finds himself. The last three words in "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
