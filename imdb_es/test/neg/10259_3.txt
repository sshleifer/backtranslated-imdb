I just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. "Lovecraft's fear of stalking", which was shot in Louisiana. Apart from some changes (names, settings), this follows the point-by-point story for the first 70 minutes, but then attempts to inject its own final "turn" that can be seen from a mile away. Either way, it's a much better adaptation than THE FEAR OF LULLING OF FULL MOON. Too bad it's a terrible movie. The director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the style of an industrial short. I swear I counted maybe with two camera movements. The design of the creature is cheap (we are talking about masks bought in the store here) but shot in a dark way (intentional or not) where they are somewhat creepy. The most impressive image is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick can not exploit that either. File this under good adaptation, bad execution.
