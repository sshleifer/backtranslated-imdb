Yes, I know that girls are attractive and the scenery is charming, but for someone who knows the place, it's fun. <br /> <br /> If you want some precision, it's not a movie you can trust. It starts with the flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio on board a 747. This will never happen on the 400 km flight. Smaller aircraft such as 737 or A-320 transport passengers between the two cities every half hour. The trip from the airport house, if shown on a map, reveals a complex zigzag back and forth. Perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the well-known taxi itineraries when they faced tourists. Not that it was a local habit, since I got ripped off in very serious places like Switzerland. The girls, yes. All topless. That is something that a stranger will never understand. The Brazilian girls will be happy to exhibit 100% of their incredible bodies in the parades of the Samba Schools and to wear bikinis almost nonexistent on the beach, but never go topless. A handful of beaches throughout the country will allow it. Everything carefully isolated and out of the city. Oh, the interior decoration; the incredible wallpaper ... maybe at Disneyworld ... Apart from that, it's very entertaining and, yes, Demi Moore is absolutely splendid.
