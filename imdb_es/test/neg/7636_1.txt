To judge a movie just for the scenery, the decoration, the costumes ... it's just not right, you lack the core: THE HISTORY <br /> <br /> A movie has to tell something, tell a story something that impresses Yes, I was pleased by the sea, the cliffs, the clear water and all that, but ... Is there a plot? <br /> <br /> They are more interesting movies with crazy people, like: "FLIGHT ON THE CUCKOO" NORTH SESO ... etc ... etc. It is a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than her children or her husband. Only a clear psychiatric case! Nothing extraordinary. Where does all that rage come from? Fish smell? Sea?
