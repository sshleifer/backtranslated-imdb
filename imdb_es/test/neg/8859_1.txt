This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. It's been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come up since then and I doubt that a film that is as bad as this one ever will be produced. Try to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) And instead of funny, it's just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or for this garbage and if someone throws it at you ... turn around and run to the other side!
