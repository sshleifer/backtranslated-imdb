I would not give too much of the film to tell you that there are many, many, many, MANY scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! Yes. And you'll be glad to know that the first third of the movie is useless, pointless and practically ignored by the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is populated by boring people who do boring things, and the most boring person of all of them is young Lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. You see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! Think that a murderer is taking advantage of blind women! He walks a lot and behaves like an unbearable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience DOES NOT pay off with this movie. In the end, the plot and the events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very difficult to worry about one or another form of what any of the nightmare images meant. Nothing is clear, the film advances to steps of a snail and left me with the same hangover effects. <br /> <br /> Judging by "Afraid of the Dark", the British do not make silly thrillers as Americans do; They make boring.
