The summary of a line is actually the joke of a very old joke that begins "what is a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> Although this movie had its interesting moments, it was too slow and it did not. Do enough to explain to those of us in the audience that we are not familiar with the orthodox Jewish custom, exactly what was going on and why? How many people who came across this movie would know that the bathtub in which the female characters were washed is actually called "Mikveh", which is a ritual bath used to cleanse the spiritual impurity? The same question might ask why the bride walked around the bridegroom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just before the marriage vows were made. These two examples are only two of a large number of those moments that were completely without explanation for the uninitiated public. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moving moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented in a very authentic way to the number of garments that an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man should wear, as well as the religious rituals that he must perform when he wakes up in the morning to start his day. The attitudes that Orthodox Judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular are intriguing and, at times, maddening. This is another reason why more explanation is needed to understand this story in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to people who are familiar with the tradition and ritual of Orthodox Jews, as well as those who are interested. In a brief look at what life is like for people who practice this lifestyle. <br /> <br /> The story itself about two sisters who in their own way rebel against "the system" has a moderate interest in better.
