Yes, I realize that half a dozen other critics have called this movie "Copiando Amadeus", but you can not say enough. The scenes seemed to have been taken directly from the Milos Forman script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> -The master's arrogant scene ("I am the voice of God, everything else makes no sense!") <br /> <br /> -The teacher makes fun of the work of the mediocre composer (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, as in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> -The mediocre composer's dialogue with God ("Why do you instill music in me but deny me the ability to compose ? ") <br /> <br /> -The musical dictation of the deathbed scene (" Common time, Begin with the violins ... cough cough ") <br /> <br /> -and the list continue ... <br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes copied blatantly, but they did not even do very well. Jeepers, if you're going to start an original, you should at least try to improve it in your own creative way. <br /> <br /> No, wait, there's something even worse than that. It is the fact that the director tried to beat the story of Mozart in the history of Beethoven. Friends, Beethoven was not a vulgar and vulgar boob as described in this movie. Also, Beethoven was not an idiot babbling who takes advice from his copyist, a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, movies like this one are responsible for the history of the butcher shop. <br /> <br /> And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) never called it the "Moonlight Sonata" as he does in the movie. That name was given by a critic confused some years AFTER BEETHOVEN DIED, and unfortunately it got stuck. But Beethoven's original title was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THING, when Beethoven (in the movie) screams "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and play the note on the piano, you are pressing a white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THING! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before composing his Ninth Symphony. This movie shows that he barely has a minor disability (say "what?" On all other lines, enough to be annoying). ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American accents ...! Oh, does not matter. It just does not matter. I've already wasted a lot of time on this. Go see "Amadeus" again. So, if you want to see an interesting biopic about Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved" who takes poetic liberties, but at least they are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out "Impromptu", a movie about Chopin. But apart from those three, I've never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
