Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher movie. We are mixing on Friday the 13th with the Blair Witch Project and adding ... a killer with a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this movie must have been very low, some of the actors performed multiple parts and the camera used produced an image equal to the colored version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, that if someone You have seen that version will back me up that it is poor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just very bad. There is nothing in the movie that is worth seeing. The very fact that I saw it all the way surprised me. Just follow my advice and do not buy or rent this movie. It's scary
