<br /> <br /> This film was produced and released as a successor to a Californian comedy from California's slapstick beach, called Hardbodies, but it has little or no connection to the previous film and is better evaluated entirely in its own right . It is certainly better than Hardbodies I, and is more closely related to films like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were also filmed during the summer in the Greek islands. The combination of wonderful beaches in blue bays with beautiful naked breasts makes it a seductive image, but (with the exception of the travel stories that have been designed to help you plan your next vacation), even those movies require a proper story if you wish keep the attention of the spectators for more. Very few minutes. Venus was based on the legend of the reincarnation of the goddess, and the Summer Lovers had the viability of a "menage a trois" as a theme. In my opinion, these two films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which has a very dim plot and depends too much on the simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. The use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious, usually leading to a series of very short independent cameo sequences that are difficult to integrate into an ongoing story line. Mel Brooks achieved this brilliantly with Silent Movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and Hardbodies II, unfortunately, has not. There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not coexist happily with the idyllic and peaceful setting in which the film develops. The final sequences of the airport were undoubtedly intended to provide a hilarious ending to this film, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst kind of exaggerated pseudo-comedy slapstick. They are also excessively long, so I left the cinema with a bad taste in my mouth. This is a film that could have been much more successful with a more solid story and with most of its slapstick sequences very pruned. As it was published, it certainly does not guarantee a rating of the viewers higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is little memorable in the performance, but the cast does everything possible within the limitations imposed by a meager history line and Poor direction - It is in these last areas where the fault arises. <br /> <br />
