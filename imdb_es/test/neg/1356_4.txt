Really crazy Even if you have not seen the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars, you can dismiss this forced, politically correct and depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What has she done to herself? His face can barely move. That just puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should be suing DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses without connection in the subconscious of the public who try to pass for friends, totally unconvincing. Eva Mendes on Joan Crawford's part is a scandalous piece of miscasting. What a terrible idea! His character is like a trans-gender artist without any taste or subtlety. It is strange to think that a woman adapted and directed this woman. The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny appearance by Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as housekeeper.
