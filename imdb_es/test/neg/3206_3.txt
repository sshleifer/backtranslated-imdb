Critters 4 begins, and I quote 'Somewhere in Kansas 1992' and a replay of the last minutes of Critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the last two Critter eggs in the universe that, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire Critter race that is against some kind of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. Charl's bounty hunter friend, Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as counselor Tetra and is a senior official in the intergalactic council and orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs, but to put them in a capsule that It will land very soon, the pod does in fact, it lands very close and Charlie places the eggs in it, but it is also stuck in the capsule, which I guess is cryogenic and freezes it as it is never explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are somewhere in Saturn's 2045 quadrant, where a rescue ship encounters the pod drifting in space (the credits have barely ended and Critters 4 is already stealing ideas and full scenes from Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, for them anyway, pod & try and make some money. With the help of his team, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the capsule is successfully recovered. They get in touch with the intergalactic council and the adviser Tetra says that she must go to an abandoned space station where there will be an exchange for the capsule and its contents. Tetra also specifically tells Rick not to open the capsule. So, in the true tradition of horror movies, Rick opens the pod, unfreezes Charlie and Critter's eggs hatch, kill Rick and escape to the space station ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Rupert Harvey I I thought that Critters 4 was a pretty useless movie and rounds the series of Critter movies with a groan instead of an explosion. The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is predictable and clich√©, the space station with an unstable reactor that will explode in a few hours, the protagonists could only neutralize by escaping so they are trapped, the race against time to save themselves, the constant disputes and discussions between the crew, the people who split up and the loser who becomes a hero and saves the day, yawns. A lot of plot devices seem to come straight from Aliens and Star Wars scam (1979) with a sticky waste compactor scene. The characters are not better and you probably do not care about any of them. While the other Critter films could be described as comedy, part 4 of the horrors can not, it seems to be extremely serious at all times. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, without incident and boring. They spend more than 30 minutes before Critter's eggs hatch and after this short sequence is almost the hour before they are seen again, why make a Critter movie and just present them? It can not be due to the expensive special effects, since they resemble glove puppets, anyway, how can a Critter of just a few hours operate a complete space station and set a course for the Earth? How do they even know what the Earth is? Why did Rick Capatin want to open the capsule anyway? What is it all about with the scientific and a rubber other thing that is only mentioned once? Why does the intergalactic council want the Critters so much? Why do only four men send? Why is this perfect-looking space station completely deserted again? Critters 4 looks cheap with unimaginative and dark sets and even steals Android images (1983) for their space ships and scenes. Critters 4 was apparently a budget so low that the filmmakers could not afford any optical effect and the necessary ones. From the look of Android seriously dated. For the most part, only two Critters are used, although some more begin to hatch, but it is quite late when this happens, for most of the movie you barely see and the effects for them are the worst of the whole series. Forget about blood or blood because the Critters only kill two people for more than 90 minutes, which was not enough to keep my interest. The performance is also quite bad with the exaggerated melodramatic reaction of Angela Bassett to see that some of Critter's eggs are particularly worth shrinking. Watching Critters 4 is a production as cheap and unspectacular as you might expect (not) to see. The end of Critters 4 makes the universe finally be saved from Critter's threat, hopefully it will also save us and our local video stores from the threat of part 5 ...
