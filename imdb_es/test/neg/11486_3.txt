Throughout the history of cinema, there have been some films that deceived the viewer, such as "the scenic fear" of Hitchcock, "open the eyes" of Alejandro Amen√°bar, "the game" of David Fincher and this "absentees" (" absent"). For starters, I do not like this kind of movies, I feel like someone is trying to take my leg off. <br /> <br /> Also, after watching this movie, you do not know what happened, it's such a confusing movie. "The Shining" by Kubrick may be a better or worse movie, but it is definitely more honest than this burden of pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> Technically it's good photography, good performance and so on, but the script is so poor that I wonder what the producers saw to continue and shoot this shit. <br /> <br /> and this film comments that the 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the cinema trying to make a masterpiece, or trying to do something to satisfy their stomachs, in wait for more personal projects.
