Poor second-rate feature of Universal Pictures about the film actor of a mom's boy who performs a criminal investigation work for the military, and moves away from the advances of the cheeky young woman who has been assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story "Come Be My Love", and his acting performances of this era are undoubtedly lazy. The plot is boring and predictable, and the writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as is usual in the films of this period) to the black wrestling maid. It is always good to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, but they can not do much with this hokey material. * since ****
