Chupacabra Terror: 10/10: it was the Navy Seal team that tipped the scales from a bad cheesy movie to just bad. Until then there was a lot of bad movie baggage, but the stamps? They wear bicycle helmets painted black. You know the air holes that make all the adults who use them look like a complete tool. Of course, the low fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue (I would not be able to cross Tampa Bay let alone an ocean). and their tactics would not be approved in a 3 rd XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepphird have photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a Hobbit? Because I can not think of any other reason why I would be in this movie. The other actors have a great excuse. They are unattractive and untalented hacks that could not be hired for an infomercial. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (I love saying it with that name) on board a cruise ship and let go. <br /> <br /> The sets consist of horrible fakes of cruise ships (complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment), the monster murders are at the bottom of the barrel, there are no nudity, and many really bad actors they refuse to finish their death scenes. Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a Doris Day movie from the 60s. <br /> <br /> The cast bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds with a green glow in dark blood. (Why a Mexican mammal that eats a goat bleeds anything, but red is beyond me). <br /> <br /> Each B film has a turning point that makes it a fun moment (Hey, it's a scene from a lesbian shower, my God, that guy just ate it's own or not so fun (Did they just to call those forty boys who were overweight and used monkeys and bicycle helmets, Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls on the not-so-fun side of film B with a thud.
