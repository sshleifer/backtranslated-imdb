The critics have begun to call it the club Oscar Winner, understandably. What after Halle Berry won for Monsters Ball went directly to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows him with The Core. Jamie Foxx plummets as a pilot in boring Stealth after collecting a gong for Ray. Now it seems that the Hollywood star, Charlize Theron, got fully into his "Monster" Oscar with this one of the worst science fiction shows ever made. What is really worth staying is the fact that, despite the fact that the film is rubbish, Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a gross and ridiculous premise. Ultimately, Æon Flux is superficial, but for an action movie it is also very boring. It will only attract comic book fans and Horney teens who like the idea of ​​Theron running half naked for 90 minutes. The flow really only succeeds in the failure. <br /> <br /> Against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on Earth, Bregna, the survivors, some four hundred years later, in the year 2415, continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed his cure. <br /> <br /> Not everything is fine in this utopia and it is not what is beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the endless jungle, but what tacit and unwritten taboo that holds and unites to these unwritten taboos that maintain and unite these unfortunates who are within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestioning obedience. Filmed in and around Berlin, ironically, this is a story set in a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its people are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinister and secret plot of how it sustains life. <br /> Æon Flux is the murderer who has been assigned by the clandestine rebels to change the course of humanity, forever. This is the story of their struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Æon Flux combined the bad stories, the fast pace and the really terrible effects. It looks more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing that is fortunate of the failure is that there are no sequels in the works, Flux could be just the beginning and end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank God for the terrible box office collections . <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this really lousy feature? There really is not a story here, just Charlize Theron jumping in a black suit like a grass hopper. The acting is very outlandish and emotionless, compared to the other movie theaters that exist today. Trying is too much to be like an adaptation and it really does not take much of the caricature that is what I expected, the only thing that was half done that pays homage to the caricature was the fly-in-the-eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
