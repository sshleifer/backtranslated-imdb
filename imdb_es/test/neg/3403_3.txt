The first movie I saw of these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I heard that this was coming, I thought it would be good to see it mainly because Waverly is a real place that is rumored to be enchanted. This documentary / movie was horrible! There were too many false comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they needed to keep their faces out of this movie. It has been rumored that Waverly has been obsessed for a long time, if anyone in doubt sees this movie, she will undoubtedly begin to believe that every story about the place is as false as this documentary. The paranormal test was horrible and almost non-existent. I've heard better EVPs of high school students with recorders in a bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. No stories, no blurry images, too dark to see anything, no images, no recordings! Children of the Grave was also bad, but at least it had some substance and a little creep factor. The only reason why I give it a 3 is because the part of the program's story was very good and informative. Learning about how the hospital came about, the daily life there and how it ended was the only thing that was worth it in this 2 hour trash.
