Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and companion Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are itinerant hunters who can not stay in one place for long. In "Helltown", the boys head to Montana, where they meet Rudd's cousin, Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It is nice to see the children wearing aprons when they begin to cook with the pack, although Dare becomes aware of herself when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) goes to the camp. Judy is Tom's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident from the start. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a herd of cattle to move, and he encourages Dare to run the road, partly to prove to Judy that he can not. At the height of the task Meanwhile, the bad Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) has his eyes on the Fillmore cattle, but when his henchmen fail to steal the pack, he believes it is easier to earn the money that Dare received at the end of the road Conning Dare in a card game rigged with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare's money begins to evaporate hand in hand. It's only when Dare does not show up at Fillmore's ranch that Tom goes looking for his cousin. Exposing the tricks, Tom, Dare and Dink follow him before the bad guys can take revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown," also known as "Born to the West," was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne's westerns series for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly alters the formula of the solitary star; Wayne gets the girl at the end of the movie, but here he was trying. There is a large scene of fugitive horses where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, in which the horse of Johnny Mack Brown makes a complete somersault. Syd Saylor does a good job as the comedic relief partner, doing everything possible to sell rays to unsuspecting victims. Replace the familiar faces of George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, staples of the Lone Star movies. The charisma of John Wayne is beginning to develop here, preparing him for the jump to superstar status he finally achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" was based on a novel by legendary Western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more movies based on Gray's stories, try "Fighting Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "The Light of Western Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe and "Heritage of the Desert" with Randolph Scott
