Hello, everyone, oh, boy ... This is a lulu. It has very bad background music every time you can squeeze it. There are three bad guys who, I suppose, are the stars of this. They hit people, cut them and collide with trucks and bulldozers. Usual things <br /> <br /> The woman who sends them on their missions can not move her mouth when she speaks. It's like seeing a bad ventriloquist who is his own fool. She walks as if she were swinging an egg in her head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a leisure style of the 70s for men and blah for the protagonist who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad mouth of the novocain woman wears red. Maybe a silk dress, or maybe a windbreaker of too big poplin. <br /> <br /> I really liked the ending even though it did not make much sense. It allows us to know what happened before in the movie. <br /> <br /> Police officers are fine. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright could have worked again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite interestingly and ends with a surprise. The medium stinks. The guy from the restaurant that gives the star a free burger does a good job. It's like a character actor from the forties. Great voice <br /> <br /> This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had only a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> Your scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
