The Untold ... is one of the worst movies I've seen. The story really looks original, but it was poorly granted on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this shit. But, hey he made a lot of low budget movies ... you need to pay the bills, you know? Joking Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this group of silly actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just to have a nudity scene, and other actors ... well, they were just there. There was always a fading that disappeared in the editing, and that makes me sick! That was the most horrible movement that keeps coming and it really makes you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a strange rhythm that goes wrong ... wrong. <br /> <br /> I can not say more ... do not rent it or buy it. You can see it, if on TV.
