Have you ever seen a movie, when after its conclusion, your left reflecting what it was about? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream." It's not that the story is complex or anything like that, but that it unfolds in three completely different ways ... 1. A fun drug movie from the 60s ... 2. A very exaggerated soap opera ... and 3. a horror movie (with very little for "Scream"). To my surprise, I discovered that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I think even the best ones have to learn through trial and error. <br /> <br /> When interpreted very similarly to something from H.G. Lewis (only with less fx), this "bad" movie has its advantages. During most of its execution time, there is an excellent jazz score that is heard, and there are a couple of memorable scenes ... one of them is where a group of children decide to experiment with acid and take a good motorcycle ride . to the zoo. The camera tricks that the director uses to indicate his hallucinatory state are simply retarded, but fun. Trust me when I tell you that there is no need to run out of the house to catch this one!
