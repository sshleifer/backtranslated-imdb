You expect it to be youthful, but at least you expect a complete and coherent film. What a waste. I am very disappointed, not only for having seen a bad movie, but for having such a good concept to be tainted by a common movie that we have all seen before. If this garbage earns $ 1 over your budget, it would be wise for the study to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste deposit, and then never make another film like that. Most of this movie will keep you thinking: "This is not what I wanted to see." This film attracts the non-intelligent and perhaps the teenagers. It's a real shame because most of the films are made for that demographic. I had much more hope in this movie.
