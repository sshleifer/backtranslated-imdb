What a terrible movie! The performance in this film is about the quality of a high school play or a pornography movie based on a story. This is not pornography in this movie, but I'm sure there's a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that prevented it from receiving a star rating. There are also a million policemen who die in this movie. However, it is hardly offensive since the violence is so unrealistic that we can only laugh. But breasts appear and are exposed in the most surprising and hilarious moments, if you enjoy really bad movies, take a look. This is a story of the kind of Bonnie and Clyde, where a mother and her two daughters go out in search of revenge. This movie also presents a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've seen shooting naked!
