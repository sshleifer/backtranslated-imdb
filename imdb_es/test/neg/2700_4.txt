Amnesic women who take off their clothes when a hat falls (or a blouse?) Are the only highlights of a film that is otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of history offers a lot of possibilities, they never develop to a satisfactory degree, and exposure is almost non-existent. A big part of the movie is a simple walk through the corridors of a multi-storey clinic / hospital. The general effect is bleak and sterile, to THX-1138.
