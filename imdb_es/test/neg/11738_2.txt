This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic movie shot by shot. I hope no one will try this technique again. In 1998, the director of "Good Will Hunting", Gus Van Sant, tried to redo the classic "Psycho" by Hitchcock in 1960 and failed miserably. What the hell was Van Sant thinking? This remake is not even close to the top of the original. The few changes that were made here did not help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
