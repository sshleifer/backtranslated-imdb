I have not reviewed anything here for quite some time, but after having the bad luck to sit through this crap rubbish as entertainment, I had to expose my thoughts. <br /> <br /> Normally, however bad something is, there's a redeeming part, whether it's an actor who was okay, a scene that was passable, an attractive cast member or a moment of general feeling. Unfortunately, that's not true here, since the movie starts in a terrible way, with a ridiculous shooting, which was so bad, that I thought it was a practice, and two fools, also known as the blue guys who talk together school. br /> <br /> One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only starred in this, but also directed this garbage, and, unlike his brothers, can not act by toffee. Not that he was alone here, since everyone in her seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> Luckily, for me, I only saw one hour of this masterpiece, like the DVD would not work, and it was probably made by the same fools that produced it. So if you have nothing to do except look at the paint dry, look at this, as it is just as boring and ideal to get rid of unwanted guests.
