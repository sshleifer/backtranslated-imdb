This is the kind of film in which I wonder why anyone would have considered doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I can not understand how people put money into it, how the rental store can put the DVD on their shelves. This is the kind of movie that I blame for having rented it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies, and I do not reject the genre. When they are good, they capture interest with the action, they have well-written characters and they act well enough that you can worry about them. The effects in some of these films are compatible with the film in many cases, and you may like them for their originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The theme and the script are at the level of cheap comics, just a clich√©. The effects are cheap, and I do not care if the movie is low budget, you can do a lot with a low budget, but it takes some talent. There are as many errors of continuity and direction as in ten other films. You do not care about the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the movie you're left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the landscape, there are some good places that are worth a much better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year so far.
