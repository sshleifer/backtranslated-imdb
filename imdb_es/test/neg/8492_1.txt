My wife received tickets for our family to attend the premiere of this film for free from their employer. I only regret the price of popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted in this garbage movie. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD of the original Mask and I enjoyed it a lot. I did not expect a new version of the original in production or writing values ​​... but I was not prepared for this heap of vulgar garbage. Weak acting, bad plot, a bad CGI baby who passes gas and urine in an overactive "mask mode" ... a woman became a giant nose, spitting mucus ... Huh? My eight-year-old son loves movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over, I asked him what he thought. Your exact words; "I hated it, it's like the Scooby Doo movie, they take something good and they have to put all those things in the rough." My daughter and my wife of twelve years also hated him. Later, my wife told me that my son asked him twice during the meeting if we could leave. He has never done that before. I'm proud of him. So that you do not think I'm a kind of puritan, because of the grunts and the lack of laughter I heard in the theater, I think most of the clients agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie represents everything bad about children. entertainment today, and any positive comments MUST be from people financially related to the movie.
