Wow, this movie stunk. <br /> <br /> This movie was a shame for the original sandlot. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The performance was horrendous. Every part, except the part of the "Mexican" sandlot manager, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, although only some parts were absolutely horrible. This was the worst role of all. Even the child actor who played him as a child was someone who would like to hit, even in the end, hahaha. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of those children's movies that go the extra mile to make a stupid part Beyond the fun stage. The mood was for the children of 6 years. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 and want something worth seeing, skip this movie and watch a comedy instead.
