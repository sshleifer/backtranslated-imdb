This show drives me crazy. It goes against everything a family should be, even if it is meant to be a comedy. The program is supposed to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) when they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good place for a comedy, yes, but it does not mean it's a good show. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've heard about parents from children more crudely and vice versa. The only talk that seems to be in the program is the control of children by parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is often a topic that teenagers often talk about, but it is addressed in almost every episode without any reason. The only episode I was seeing involved parents giving their daughter a car, Hilary, not once do you think they are related in any way to the way they talk and how parents talk about how Hilary is "her slave". "<br /> <br /> The show fails more at the comedy level, I have not laughed at this program even once in the many times I've tried to see it, and I'm a person who gave very good grades to films like Animal House and Dumb and Dumber, Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and the reason why he decides to ruin his career by making this piece of garbage show me over. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure that your children never, and I mean, never look at this, teenagers, they will probably make fun of this just because of blatant sexual references, but nothing comes of that and then it feels pretty empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1 / 2/5 stars.
