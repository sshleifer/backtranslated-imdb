One of the most pleasant surprises of this short 3 band short in Technicolor was that a ballet dancer who appears here was called Maria Gambarelli! I half wondered if Blake Edwards would name the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this artist now forgotten (although the spelling of the surname of Sommer's character was actually Gambrelli). I saw it on YouTube, mainly to see an early appearance of Judy Garland, while we see her in profile with her two older sisters singing "La Cucaracha". That was the highlight for me that, otherwise, showed some dances (like that of Mrs. Gambarelli) that were nice and a boring comedy between Andy Devine as a great fighter (yes, sure!) And Buster Keaton as a bull owner who offers Uno who is obviously a man in an animal costume. The only fun part of those two is when they cry, while Buster provides a handkerchief to the "bull" during the sad part of "La Cucaracha". I was also lame watching Ted Healy without his puppets dealing with an agent who continues to confuse Healy with other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left The Marx Brothers since he put "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig, although he wears a hat to hide His head bald. It was also interesting to see Ida Lupino among the cowgirls at the beginning, although I also recognized Toby Wing for her participation in Murder in the Vanities last year (at least when the announcer Pete Smith identified her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his wise story. Other famous stars that you may or may not recognize are also in cameos, and neither are all players with an M-G-M contract! So with all that said, Santa Barbara's party is worth it for anyone who is curious about the first appearances in the cinema of Judy Garland or the early use of Technicolor in 3 bands.
