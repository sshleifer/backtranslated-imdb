The vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random act of violence sold it to me and I am happy to say that the rest of Vindicator provided a real feast of cheese. <br /> <br /> The vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who almost died from an explosion. in his laboratory, whose tattered remains are put inside an armor / experimental suit. For some unfathomable reason, it is equipped with a Rabies Response Activator, a device connected to your brain that will turn you into a homicide if it comes into physical contact with any other person. They give a silly explanation about what a necessary defense mechanism is like, but I can not see the logic of installing such a device unless you wanted a cyborg killing machine. It is especially ridiculous when it is indicated that Carl's suit is actually an experimental space suit. What possible need would there be for an astronaut to become the incredible hulk on a mission? Predictably, he leaves the lab and proceeds to fight the risky scientists who put him in the suit, along with the killer ninja Hunter played by Pam Grier (No, actually). <br /> <br /> The Vindicator itself looks pretty. damn fool. He's basically a guy in a shredded gold foil suit. He also has a perplexed look forever, which does not inspire fear or compassion. I guess you can not blame him for that, most people who watch the movie will have that same expression on their faces. <br /> <br /> The acting is very bad, forced, 'I'm not sure what The character's emotions or thoughts are what this point indicates, so I'll take a punt and launch my dialogue on a random tone of voice as I try not to look at the camera acting school. The actor who plays the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part. <br /> <br /> It is after this initial accidental death that the Vindicator pursues the scientists. Oddly enough, the entire Rage Response trigger 'touch me and kill you' does not play as important a role as might be expected, since Carl will pursue his former colleges in a fairly independent way. There was a scene where he brutally kills some street punks who push him. I know it's de rigueur for street gangs to randomly attack the main characters in the movies of the eighties, but surely one of them must have realized that it might be a bad idea to attack the giant cyborg even if he looks like the retarded cousin of C3PO. As they are, they do not even seem so surprised to see a smashed golden cyborg walking down the street as if it were something that happened every day to them. The only time this anger response activator appears in the movie is when old Carl can not hug his wife. When Hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing him against him to be forced to kill her, casually remark that it has been reprogrammed (naturally, off the screen) so that this does not happen. They could have omitted the whole issue of Rage Response Activator and simply gone with a story of revenge and it would not have made a big difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a funny sequence in the sewers as Grier and his cronies track the vindicator. Because of their armored hideaway, they are all armed with weapons that fire 'vaporized acid'. For some strange reason, when these weapons are fired, they are represented on the screen by red cartoons that are directed towards their targets right up to the Ghostbusters. The Vindicator defends himself by ripping a gas pipe from the wall and incinerating all Grier's thugs in a huge gust of flame that comes out. The resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it leaves the sewers of a manhole and explodes the van that are some of the scientists. Oddly enough, Grier escapes by throwing himself an inch deep despite the fact that he was closer to the Vindicator. This is one of several false explosions of fire throughout the film, including the death of a black scientist when the vindicator sends his truck off a cliff. (This is after they capture The Vindicator trapping him in a giant gello-no, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing, long and misplaced sequence in which Carl's overbearing friend, who looks like poor Ned Beatty, reveals his infatuation with Carl's wife and tries to rape her. . It continues for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the man slipping over the wife's face, turning on her and trying to take off her dress. It's hard to say the least and it seems really out of place with most of the rest of the movie, which is quite caricatural and bigger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The end of the film involves the vindicator fighting against a whole bunch of other guys in battle suits. For whatever reason, all these other guys are less disgusting than Carl, some of whom were dispatched by the wife simply because they had a protruding tube on their torn side. Luckily for Carl, the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw. The only really memorable part towards the end is Grier's death. Doing something he had never seen an evildoer do in a movie before, in the midst of his confrontation with the vindicator, she decides that he really does not have a chance against him and, in a more or less obvious way, blows up his own brain. with his gun.
