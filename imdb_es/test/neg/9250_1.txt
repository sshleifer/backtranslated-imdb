As bad as good, not only the script is obvious, but the performance is not only bad, but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic wit, affected reactions, forcing the camera to see superficial aspects, which are presented as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> I can not help but laugh when, in the end, the main character says: "your daughter does not play football and does not know how to cook". Such an offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Is the film about the psychological behavior of the second character? About its impact on the main character? Or simply a sequence of events set out in To warm the obvious end? <br /> <br /> Please, do more of these. I had a good time guessing what would be the next thing that would go wrong
