The necessary Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried to be a serious film about college football at all levels. Many of the current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedians. Apart from that it is a very mediocre movie. They should have limited themselves to making a direct comedy without realism. Instead, the filmmakers try to play in both fields and end up at the short end of the suit. When will someone make a decent movie about college football that is fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended, unless it's free on television.
