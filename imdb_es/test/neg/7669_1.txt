WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> God knows I've seen some bad movies in my time and it makes me just as angry. This is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. The "story" involves a stewardess who discovers that her boyfriend (misunderstood by the great Robert Wagner) is a murderer, a thief and only one face of vomit in general. After the Concorde takes off, it sends guided missiles to destroy the Concorde. Then, while the Concorde travels at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with absolute stupidity, George Kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit, then removes his hand from the window to shoot the missile. I am not a space scientist, but it seems that at least his hand would burn with the wind. Then, towards the final "climax", when the Concorde goes to a certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fianc√© and proposes marriage. A Priest is simply sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them when the planes are crashing! (I'm not making it up) Wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been smelling glue for a week.
