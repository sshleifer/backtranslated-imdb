Developing films based on real events related to cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. It must primarily reconcile the reported testimonies, conflicting sources of information and Hollywood creativity to produce something that the audience can enter. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of these things seems to take place. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in the typical black cinema when a research team lands somewhere in the Cascades by plane. From there, the investigation team disappears and, despite attempts by law enforcement officials and local rescue teams, they remain missing for some time. While one of the passengers walks, the images similar to infrared are seen on the screen (to the Predator), which subtly hints that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the destinations of the passengers. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the victims of the accident. Knowles brings together her own search and rescue team with the explicit mission of finding her daughter and the rest of the research team, along with the inestimable technology that was lost during the accident. <br /> <br /> After the personalized rescue of Knowles The team is united, the whole film travels the path of colorless characters, a dizzying cinematography and a totally original plot. I literally had to avoid falling asleep during this movie, since it was trying to scare me. The only member of the cast who took his own was Henriksen, which does not compensate for the lack of depth presented in all the other characters. The exaggerated sound effects were also annoying; Basically, I did not know if I was watching a movie about Bigfoot or grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> The plot was not that great either. It was too underdeveloped, since the viewer is subject mainly to the typical music of fear found in something similar to the genre. Obviously, he did not have to be a genius to find out who would be taking all the clothes off in the middle of the movie, or who would be the first unfortunate person to be attacked by Mr. Sasquatch. As for the good points, there are none, and therefore I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.
