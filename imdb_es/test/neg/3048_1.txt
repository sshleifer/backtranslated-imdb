From time to time I will see a movie that completely surprises me. One that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of stimulating entertainment. One that is pure fun from beginning to end. Well folks, when a stranger calls, it's NOT that movie. It is an incredibly stupid and crazy remake of the classic of the best horror camp of 1979. Our main heroine, Jill, is forced to take care of her children after checking the minutes of her cell phone and is harassed by phone calls from a mysterious person who calls All the clich√©s of the world are used here, from the stupid jump from a cat's hiding place to the car that does not start, the killer can be anywhere and at any time. This movie is bad ... not even bad in a way "so bad that it's good" rather than in a way "so bad is boring". Skip this beautiful movie and save your movie for something else. Then you will thank me, trust me in this. Grade: D-
