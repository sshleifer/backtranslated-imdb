I learned little of the importance of this film that I still did not know about CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not follow Enron's case obsessively as some others did). The film did a very bad job of explaining Enron's "business" that could have been on the rise before it began to hide its debts. In the entities created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly minimized the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in the validation of practices that were later considered illegal. Nor did it go as far as it could have done in exploring what the "investors," all the prominent bankers, thought they were doing. With cable networks 24 hours a day, the Discovery Channel and the History Channel, documentaries have proliferated. I have seen many in the last year that were better than this one.
