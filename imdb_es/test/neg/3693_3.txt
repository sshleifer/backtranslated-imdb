The plot in this movie is very thin, and there is not much action. Val Kilmer, I do not know why he agreed to make this film, plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is tedious to watch. <br /> <br /> A man, who looks like a professor of archeology / religion, is exploring an underground area of ​​Moscow, which has some history related to the construction of railroads and the Bolshevik. revolution. A tragedy of the church in that story makes the "spiritual" exploration and the spirits of a malevolent intent chase the underground ruins. A friend of the teacher decides to find his friend on the subway and hires a couple of Russian guides. The whole film is based on this plot and contains many repeated sequences of the underground, and some camera effects; like those seen in "Day Watch", "Night Watch", etc.
