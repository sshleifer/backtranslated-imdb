This Gothic "mellerdramer" from the superheated south has some decent moments, but is often ruined by a novice director cliché cliché cliché and a star that apparently decided to take charge of turning the image into his personal showcase, instead of allowing the writer / director Gabel updated Inge or Williams as a kind of contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" and "Lolita" tearjerker. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents and try to decide if you are watching a feature film, or an acting class, full of enthusiastic fans. <br /> <br /> For once, Johansson is tolerable (that is, less annoying than usual), although by no means good, Macht is decent, although he is too cute a boy, to believe it, and Travolta chews the stage like never before (with the help of a decent editor and a little moderation of the direction, his performance could have been really moving - as it is, he, and almost everyone else, is too unpleasant to spend more beyond the point of boredom or repulsion). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of all; If her role had been developed beyond a few lines, she could have found a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The photo is almost saved by Leonard Cohen's theme, the production design and the decent locations, and the continuous reference to literary works (which have won criticism of the scripts as "poetic") . Some old professionals in the cast are useful as Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, the Soderbergh cameraman, Elliot Davis, whose excellent work will undoubtedly be credited to the first director, who, in ten or twenty years, will actually learn to lead. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
