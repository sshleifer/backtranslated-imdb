* POSSIBLE AHEAD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I will only say what has not been said here (and I will continue with this for the rest of my WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you are going to have a match for the women's title, at least make it interesting, instead of just a squash to put on the current champion. I guess Moolah could not stand an intense game, but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the Killer Bees were wasted at WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair had left and Jim Brunzell became a canvas behind. So, for a while, I did not realize they were a top-notch team, even the best contenders. <br /> <br /> But I loved watching Bill Fralic in the real battle. He really came into his account here, creating an arrogant heel character in a pregame interview and even doing a real battle elimination. In addition to Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation who respects wrestling (does anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what about the ridiculous green stockings of the Hart Foundation?
