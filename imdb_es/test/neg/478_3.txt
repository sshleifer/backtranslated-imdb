I'm 35. Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead, and I still love watching ED1 and ED2. It was also great to see him as El Rey two or three years ago at Bubba Ho Tep, where he demonstrated versatility and great talent for acting. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for the first Bruce fans. Either I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm just not part of Bruce's target audience anymore. I am sure that children from 9 to 13 years old will love this movie. But this sci-fi comedy about extended matinee contains about 5 minutes in total of interesting moments, and the rest is humor for children. Campbell is better than talking seriously with Sam Raimi and having their brains scream together for one last picture of the Evil Dead meeting to regain my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry, Bruce, this is not enough for me. Beware.
