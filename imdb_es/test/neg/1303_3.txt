I'll tell you directly, this movie is boring. It is a flood, that is all. Blah, blah, a little about the family, blah, blah, blah, politics, blah, blah, blah, bored. <br /> <br /> Blame everything on the weather man, poor thing. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is an imbecile who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, an extremely irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK, or from any place that may flood, this movie may be of interest to you. It is something like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie, where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer it, or overcome it literally, it's more like a time bomb that must be deactivated. <br /> <br /> Looking at this movie, it is understandable that the UK thinks that the world is overpopulated, it is not, but for them it is. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie is as exciting as picking up scabs and I can not recommend it. They are more than 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> The problems with the movie; I will not go into them beyond this because the film does not deserve such a dissection. Tip for you from London - buy more boats. If you bring children to this movie, they will fall asleep or they will become bored and uncontrolled demons without control.
