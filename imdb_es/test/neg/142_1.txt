This movie is about promoted! It saddens me to say that I can see the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that, I'll have to work hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It is totally stupid and very false. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing that steel suit and the acting is very bad, especially that of the Alien character. He is totally annoying !! Do not waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I prefer to sleep or spend my money on other things instead of watching this movie. 1 of 10. If possible, would give 0.
