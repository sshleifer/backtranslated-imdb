it is unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by previous biases. (ie, anger for the gay characters, thinking that French thrillers are bad, etc.) I will admit that I am not familiar with the novel, but as a movie, after about 45 minutes, I was rolling my eyes. I hope I can explain my complaints in writing with sufficient eloquence before getting tired of spending more time on this film during the 2 hours (2 hours that it felt like 3) do not get me wrong, I can sit up to the hour and a half silent movies, 3 epic of hours, I do not have a short attention span, nor am I so tired by the mtv generation that I can not appreciate a subtle and slow-moving movie. Here goes, my shopping list of complaints. First, the end. Yes, I had a scooby-doo-esquire, the character explains everything at the end. Now I really think that for this movie, this was necessary. The film had so many twists of plot, emotional revelations, new facts that are being discovered and ... a critic said it well: "... yes, it is a very logical story, but without the essential background story (its stories of childhood, the relationship between the 3 parents, the relationship between the two lovers and the son of the Great Man), it just does not feel right, I felt cheated "I won" I do not include too many spoilers here, I could name specific revelations that I thought that were unnecessary, but according to the reviews here, there are many people who really love this, so I do not want to reveal anything, I personally can not stand the soap operas, the complexity, and the twists and turns, for me, eliminated ANY impact that the final revelations could offer.In the end, I really did not care! There was no plot hole open necessarily, This seems like it could be a great book, in WRITING it is perfectly logical, but if I'm supposed to believe that this is REALITY, something does not fit with the pieces that have been inserted randomly. too often I felt crucial characters that we could never know, they were thrown to complicate the plot even more, increase the emotion and develop the mystery. The performance that had no complaints, the address, eh, is not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, lacks a LOT SIGNAL. I'm sorry for those who felt that this was a perfect thriller, but I could not get into it. I gave him a 3 simply because I do not want to seem completely unfair, and had moments of slight intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAIN SPOILER * and I have to mention it ... but when the father is making his disclosure to Alejandro and Justo when you think the plan could not fit into another turn ... "your father does not did not die in a hunting accident "... I ALMOST TOLD ME ... when did the father develop or even really mentioned much in the background story? Seriously!! As the complex plot that involves characters from all families and their relationship, was not it enough? Does the protagonist NEED another emotional blow more than he has already been fed ?! Sorry, I had to launch a spoiler, but that bothered me as much as it never bothered me in ANY movie.
