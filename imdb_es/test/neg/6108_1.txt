As a writer and an expired Orthodox Jewish woman, this movie disappointed me greatly. The dialogue is trite and wasteful, the characters, too committed to lines ranging from the incredibly prosaic to the amazingly melodramatic, can not expand to individuals with a genuine texture. The musical score of a single trick tries to compensate for the foolishness, throwing itself silently into silence to obstruct the spectator and the script of the prolonged catatonia. <br /> <br /> Like a teenage revolutionary in a self-satisfied tirade, This film is swept away by the wisdom of its revelation (patriarchy is wrong) and it wastes its energies, insisting on this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; The moral crime is the reduction of human beings to cartoons: martyrs and grotesques.
