A big disappointment for what was promoted as an incredible movie. Incredibly bad Very pretentious It would be good if only once someone created a high profile role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We do not really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be an hopeless alcoholic. We do not know why. Nicholas Cage presents an excellent performance as usual, but I think this role and this script disappointed him. And how, after not being able to act in the whole movie, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt that I needed a bath.
