At least, some of the sitcoms that come out of the United States are honestly bad. This garbage, however, portrays a parenter√≠a side "that heats the heart" to a clothesline. Acting ridiculously "learned" with looks and phrases pronounced in the manner "I AM SO important, slim and beautiful". In the episode I just talked about, someone's "job" was at risk simply because a colleague had "made" a phone call, I could not see their capabilities ... !! Actually, this is the lowest of the low. What kind of damage does this affect the vigilant masses, seeing only dazzling glam-puss people parading "working"? Making absolutely sick. When the titles rolled, I thought, well, it provided work for the boys. You know who you are.
