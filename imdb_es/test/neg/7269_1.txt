This movie is horrible At first I thought it could be attractive to children, because of the affectionate Ewoks, the fury of the little Stars Wars. After going through this monstrosity of a movie, I'm sure that even a 4-year-old would not find this movie interesting. The special effects are, by far, the best of this film and compare well with other television movies of the 80s. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad, and the film is so predictable that still I can not believe I could not touch the advance button on my VCR. However, I was close to changing this disaster more than once.
