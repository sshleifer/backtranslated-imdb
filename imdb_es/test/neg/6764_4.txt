Some nameless aliens in a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot Kronos to steal the world's energy. They have a prototype playing around Mexico for the starters and if it is successful, more will be sent. Undoubtedly, it would only take Kronos a long time to accomplish that task. <br /> <br /> For reasons, I can not explain that the aliens capture for the first time the mind of the outstanding scientist John Emery, who telepathically directs Kronos to his first objectives Since Emery is killed later and the monster seems to work well enough without Emery as a controller, why the aliens needed it in the first place is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, who work under Emery, are not fooled a bit about their nature. And, of course, they come up with a plan to deal with the furious metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties, you never see the bad guys who only seek to undermine humanity. It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> It seems that the players are having a great time as many clich√©s that the writers could put in the script. I get the impression that Kronos is the kind of movie that Ed Wood could have done with a bigger budget and a little more attention.
