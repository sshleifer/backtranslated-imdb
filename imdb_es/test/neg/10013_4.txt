Here is an Italian apocalyptic take on the hunting / killing of humans by sports theme, such as The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the movie that is reviewed here does not have so much value funny as the other entries listed and, in addition, is dragged down by a voice-over deficient in the work, in general action sequences bland, a series of totally tasteless scenes, such as a sequence of prolonged rape and some points really stupid and illogical in everything. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, towards the end of the movie, when our hero manages to infiltrate the villainous complex. Initially kill a sentinel and leave it in his jeep. When you discover the aforementioned corpse, do the villains respond? (Bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all). They resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I suppose to be fair, the film is still visible if you can suspend your disbelief during those stupid scenes and greatly benefits from the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (even if your screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> It is not a classic in any sense of the imagination but still worthy of a watch for Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.
