A really wonderful cast and a very talented technical team wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time, bothering to support this totally predictable and clearly formulated piece of commercial scrap. The film is based on a really good idea and very current, but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard formula of Hollywood "disaster film" and, therefore, ruined any potential value of production. <br /> <br /> An Unusually High Tide and very strong storm conditions combine to produce a great record storm that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot centers around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who alerts the authorities of the danger and, finally, saves the day, a glamorous police chief who runs the show and a deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who tries seem important <br /> <br /> But everything is so unreal that one feels like a prolonged tea break after only 30 minutes. The young attractive police commissioner demands full authority over the army during a declared state of emergency and obtains it (as if!). The experienced general is simply set apart as a complete imbecile who has to lick his boots because of his obviously superior capacity. The problem is that our wife, who is now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters who traveled to South West London and have not phoned to say they were okay. So our powerful wife has her staff looking for them and decides that the only priority for the entire army and rescue services should be Southwest London and not any other neighborhood in the city. Of course, the Minister, the Army and the whole delegation accept their prioritization without questioning it. It can only be assumed that everyone had properties there. When your children are finally found after endless reports and efforts from your staff, our male hero tells us: 'Thank God you are safe, that is the most important thing.' It does not matter about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities that it was supposed to control; While his own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is just one more excuse to push the same old machista chauvinist macho who says that women are intelligent, aware, understanding and clearly capable leaders, while men are useless except physical courage, force without sense and very specialized knowledge. And, nevertheless, the simple instruction that could have given to the population; that is, to go to the nearest tall building and quietly climb to the fourth floor or higher and wait for instructions when the waters recede, it was never this female super hero, nor anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve and, nevertheless, millions of people apparently did not think of climbing the stairs! The pathetic garbage.
