This movie was downright horrible. Most of the comic scenes seem obsolete and trite, and possibly the most entertaining scene in the movie had already been revealed in the previews. The entire premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it is difficult to really get into it. The actors themselves represent the most unreal characters. It's not just the fact that the films are so hard to swallow, but their way of continuing down the throat, waiting for you to reprimand them and accept them. The plot itself is so superficial and easy to predict. the child is in some way rejected by all the schools to which he applied (I suppose he forgot completely to attend community college) and decides to create his own school for the rejected ones. Everything is going well for a while until the validity of your school is questioned. all the time the dorky character manages to attract his beautiful neighbor to fall in love with him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill that only he possesses. Then comes the final struggle with the students in some way all united and fighting for the survival of the school. Of course, the main character persuades the state board of education to allow his school to maintain an "inspiring" speech. This movie would have been funnier to see if he was under 16 and still ignorant of all university issues and affairs.
