I really do not know why I'm writing this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me tell you this: <br /> <br /> When I finish watching movies, I like them. Then, as time passes, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with the end of days. I liked the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So, to solve this, I saw him again at a friend's house. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I am a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, then I start to get angry. More than two and I'm fucked up. The end of the days got me crazy after my second viewing. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything is sad. Everything from the performance of Arnold to the colors of the film. But dark-looking movies do not bother me, but another thing ... If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin grows back. If you cut off his head, a new one should reappear. Then he asks: what is the point of even trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. This is not the devil my friends. This is a human being reminiscent of those Bond villains who give the whole scheme to the hero. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's worth seeing, but I do not see it twice, because it's crap.
