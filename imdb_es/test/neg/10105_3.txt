OK, the box seems interesting, the opening has good music and is a bit original, so everything is fine. But when the movie starts ... well, it's not my first video movie, I saw Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this movie, except it's even worse here. The story at first sounded interesting, but the whole movie looks like a movie filmed by a group of college students, with a special effect that makes me laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the fire effect on the face of the Demon seems to be done with a program that I could buy at my local computer store. The whole film is recorded in the day (very good for a movie that is supposed to be horror) and there is no gore (only 1 scene and it looks homemade and it is not credible) and almost without blood (can be considered a great thing) considering the appearance of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story is not going anywhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts, there is so much useless scene made just to give the movie the average duration time (when the devil looks for the guy in the dog thing for about 4 minutes ...) Too many things in slow motion. Well, let's say this movie is from the Z series and very bad. Every great idea was lost and you get a corny movie. I got bored all the time and I'm not the type who gets bored easily with the horror movie, I even like the house of the dead and only in the darkness of Uwe Boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst directors. But here it seems too much like some guys who want to make a movie for fun. Also, for us, a French speaker (I do not understand English, I prefer to watch films in my native language), there is a bad translation in the video. In the normal movie, you can hardly see that it is not the actor who speaks (you have to read the lips, etc.), you just have to listen and you know it. Very cheesy
