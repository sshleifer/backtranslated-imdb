A stupid supposed teen comedy that turns into a serious misunderstanding, which includes (but is not limited to) a whore confused with a foreign student, a beating of a girlfriend, a girl who loves a gay man and the heterosexual man who loves and malicious gossip. None of the following is funny or even fun. The use of Nation Lampoon to be hilarious in its day. Now the name is sadly synonymous with garbage. And this is not an exception. I used to think that Topenga was a little cute when she was in "Boy Meets World", but it seems she got carried away (and yes, I know she has a name, but if she does anything else worthwhile, she'll stay like Topenga) <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann goes topless; Boti Bliss rests on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
