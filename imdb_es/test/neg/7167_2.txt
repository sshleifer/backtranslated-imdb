'Book II' is not a movie, it is a sermon. This nauseating, sickly and almost unbearably tedious false fire probably works as religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value beyond a few jokes by George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl whom (ahem) God asks her to mount an advertising campaign that makes people believe in him again. Not really, that's the story. It is a load of old cobblers who have too many "justifying" religious arguments, which justify themselves, but hardly a decent dialogue and, certainly, a total absence of anything that comes close to magic or charm. "Miracle on 34th Street", this is not it. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life in this stale, quick-setting concrete puddle, but Louanne's annoying script and trash quickly send this to the fiery depths of your knowing where.
