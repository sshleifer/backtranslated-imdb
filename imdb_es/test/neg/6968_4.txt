I recently watched Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical film, Glen or Glenda, for the first time, after hearing a lot about it for so many years. Nothing I had read or heard about this movie could prepare me for what I saw. This has to be the strangest movie ever made. Stampede buffaloes, women in captivity, Satan going around and Bela Lugosi, wandering only what he can, "Bevare, Bevare ... pull the rope, pull the rope ...", was totally crazy. The performance was atrocious and the dialogue was, unintentionally, hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an Ed Wood movie. Having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, I have to give Wood credit ... he was way ahead of his time. You have to remember that when this movie was made, the transvestites were not even discussed in public, let alone the subject of a movie. I read that Wood was a real-life transvestite, and I'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this movie, but it was kind of like Ed Wood Jr. at least give Mr. Lugosi an actor job at a time in Bela's life when he did not I had a penny. and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him. If you have never seen this movie, then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
