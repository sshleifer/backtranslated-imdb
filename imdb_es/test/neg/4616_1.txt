I had never left a movie before this one. I had entertained myself with the idea a couple of times, but this time I did, I went to see the end of another movie, but I had to go back and see the end of Rage while I was waiting for my friends. They told me that I did not miss much when I left. In general, I felt offended by the whole movie, in such a grandiose way that I can not even describe it. My instinct told me to leave the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. The plot focused on the cruel actions of some reprehensible adolescents against other vulnerable and problematic ones. There was no ray of light, no reasonable or pleasant person to provide contrast. I discovered that even the "good guys" in the movie did not do anything for me, they were stupid, stupid, whiny or just ineffective. <br /> <br /> The graphic images of repetitive suicide were exaggerated, unnecessary and disgusting. (Not in a "I am easily mocking" way, but rather in the portrait of indifference towards humanity). And in addition to the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes they became annoying. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually, I can find some good things to counteract the not so good of any movie. I'm not saying that this movie did not have anything good, but I'm saying that, whatever it is, I can not remember it with all the other shit that drove me crazy. I also regret that very much. Perhaps the best parts were the original classic clips.
