All children finally learn the lesson that just because a girl is beautiful does not mean she is good. Well, let me tell you, at age 19, lesson learned. It's hard to say which is worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-sharp voice; the one that sounds like a screeching mouse on helium scratching its tiny claws on a blackboard.

If there ever was a candidate for a revival of Mystery Science Theater 3000, it would be this one.
