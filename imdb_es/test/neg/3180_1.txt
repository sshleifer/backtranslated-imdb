I am surprised and surprised to find criticisms that are not miserable for this horrible movie. I rented this "movie" or excrement, whatever you want to call it, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop looking. Just listening to the dialogue left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This movie was almost as smart as an ass. I hope I do not see Anne again, so like a bra and ragged (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like watching the most putrid pilot of a comedy that will never hit the television. but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could see) it was an unbearable 90 minutes.
