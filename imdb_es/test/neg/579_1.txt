I'm a big fan of Robert Taylor and I've been trying to find all his movies. This is one I did not have, but I saw it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and I was very disappointed. I know he was a player hired with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the off-screen relationships between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on the screen between the two. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the president of the USA. UU He would order a naval lieutenant to leave the service in secret to hunt down bank robbers and inform the president alone, which made it difficult to appreciate anything else on film. The death row scenes were completely motionless. The only thing worse than Taylor's performance was Stanwyck's singing. She improved later in the Ball of Fire, thanks to the heavens.
