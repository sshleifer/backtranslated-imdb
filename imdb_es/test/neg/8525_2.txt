I almost laughed when, during the comment, the director said that this movie is original with a solid plot. There is not one ... repeat AN original plot or special effect in this movie blah. <br /> <br /> The crows ... Hitchcock did it superbly before CGI and even with CGI this movie does not reach a well-made attack scene. The spooky boy ... The Grudge did it and he did it better. The psycho ... made at Cold Creek Manor more recently, however, has been done to death. There is no wordplay. Disconnected / rebellious teenager that nobody listens ... around a dozen movies have used it until the Beetlejuice. What's in the basement ... can you say Amnityville Horror? Doors that open unexpectedly ... What's underneath did it with much more style. Scary farm ... too large to mention. <br /> <br /> The backdrop of metaphysics, which should have been the central focus, is lost once you discover what is happening, which by the way is very early. <br /> <br /> One What they (in reality) do not even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was absorbed by the mud in the basement, so they do not really have a body. <br /> <br /> In general ... NOT BETTER
