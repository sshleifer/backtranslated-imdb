Oh dear, oh dear! What were you thinking? Terrible script, terrible acting. I do not even feel sorry for the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and they smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since when did a Charing Cross jet of air come out in the Bank? Why do the vehicles crossing the Tower Bridge go towards the city when the surge occurs? Why does not Tower Bridge fill up when the city is being evacuated? How does Carlyle plunge into a raging torrent ... and survive? I could continue ... and continue. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They could be waiting for the England eleven to return to the court after the tea interval at Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I wait for the ads to come out to learn more about the treatment of diarrhea with anxious anticipation. <br /> <br /> Garbage totally abominable!
