It is not "confusing" in the sense that, "Wow, this movie is really complex and, therefore, difficult to follow". But confusing in the sense that, "Wow, this movie really has no idea what it is doing!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but it is complete nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with time travel mixed with a love story mixed with nonsense. <br /> <br /> The movie has the kind of concept that stuns the mind. Again, it does not stun the mind because it is so cool and complex, but it stuns in the sense that it is so ridiculous and one can not conceive that someone has such a horrible premise to begin with. <br /> <br /> Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR makes sense, and that's because the whole movie should never have been made. It's pretty horrible The only saving grace is the actress who plays the warrior (not the protagonist). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
