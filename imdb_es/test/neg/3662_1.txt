This movie seemed to have been filmed with a video phone, had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The movie never got together or made much sense, and for a movie like this, of course, there were some unnecessary shots. The director was obviously trying to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was really happening, even in the end I was left with a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion for the lack of plot and anger because I wanted to recover my two dollars of box office success and 1.5 hours of my life. They must have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
