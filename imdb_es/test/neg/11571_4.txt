28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 that represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the entire world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup overthrew Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected Marxist president anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is too skewed and nostalgic towards the time of the Allende government to be an objective interpretation of man and his place in history. The times were worried and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and the whole world. It is true that he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged Chile into an economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup d'etat and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making the revolution. We will never know if his attempt to build a socialist but democratic society had succeeded. The authors of the film take a completely pro Allende position, there is no opinion or point of view that tries to explain the other side, to answer questions such as why the middle class opposed it, or how their democratic views could join to support or being supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who wish to better understand this episode of the story should expect a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
