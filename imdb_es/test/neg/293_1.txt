Like a terrible cancer that was raining from the sky, the other night I entered this party in a movie channel. Being a fan of bad movies, and actively participating in the purchase and visualization of that bad movie, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​an action movie with a genuinely terrible aspect that comes from modern times. However, after it disappeared, I found that my hands inexplicably turned against me, grabbing anything within reach and stabbing my head and neck. Something sinister was on that tape ... err ... where was I ... anyway, this is among the most shamefully bad movies I've ever encountered. William Forsythe can not play more than one character, and that character is always a walking joke. Even when you set out on a comical background and are given things to do and say that they are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo), you can laugh the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is very similar, since she starred in her fair share of terrible movies and did terrible jobs in all of them, it does help to get rid of it. Andrew Divoff, the classic villain of the series films, does a respectable job, but has almost nothing to do with it. Even the reliable standby mode for the action of movie B, Daniel Bernhardt, can not offer anything that limits entertainment. As for the merits of the film, the plot is sparse, the script, like the action and movement of the plot, is boring and ... well, stupid, for lack of a better adjective (the man knows they did not put anything). effort in that, why should I?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones, and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here. to be enjoyed unless you're among the most movie-tolerant and just feel so inclined to test your mettle. However, before you do, take it, this is not terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike, for example, some of the most ridiculous Italian zombie movies). A fan of the b-movie action would be much better if he reviews most of Bernhardt's other films, or anything else that has been shot for that matter. The United States is simply not the place to go for the action it seems, especially not now. If you have a craving, check out everything in the sea, movies like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider (along with anything else in the impressive Keita Amemiya canyon) will give you much more fun and much better action that your apt to Find elsewhere, especially here.
