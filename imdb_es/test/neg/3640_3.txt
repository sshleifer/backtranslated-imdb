This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect; she is insipid, she gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she's popular, she goes to an amazing school with incredible rooms. Reasons why I gave this program a 3: 1. The acting is horrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these actresses without talent (especially Victoria Justice) on television. 2. The characters are incredible and do not match. You have your typical popular girl. A girl full of life, superficial, stupid, stereotyped, portrayed by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical type of athlete that is normal and really nice. Then, the stereotyped intelligent girl who is a phenomenon and obviously does not fit with her perfect popular friends. Then, a rich and stagnant handsome guy who would be happier looking in a mirror all day. Then he wants to be an actress who is played by another stinking actress. And finally a normal nerd person. 3. The plot is boring, and fuck. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can not they be normal? 5. Everything ends up perfect for them, and we all remember how much our life sucks.
