I attended the premiere last night. The movie started with a pop (maybe because of the pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time struggling to sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guest's works, unless you want to say that _Sons of Provo_ is an error that wants to be very wrong. It just fell flat, it died, it was painful. The story did not get anywhere, the jokes were vapid, even if you were a Mormon and could get all the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby's performance was successful! And the songs were very smart (only for an SUD audience). So, my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you're a Mormon, buy the music CD.
