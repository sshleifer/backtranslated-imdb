Did the first parody really make money? This is another sequel (in the line of ANOTHER PARTICIPATION) that nobody asked for. But we have received it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely dead brain. It's also pretty nasty (remember the dinner scene?) To think that I almost feel sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they need the money so much?
