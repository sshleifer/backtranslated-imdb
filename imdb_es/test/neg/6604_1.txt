Not many people outside of Poland have had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the brilliant writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. It is very popular in Poland for its fantasy stories (I think none of them has been translated into English, alas!). To summarize the story, wiedzmin, the main character in the sapkowski books, is a traveling monster killer, a man of extraordinary strength and ability: he is practically your favorite type of favorite Tolkien style. unfortunately, no one would solve it after watching the movie. 'wiedzmin' the film is nothing more than a collection of random scenes, with wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but which do not resemble at all the plot and the dramatic rhythm of the original. in fact, the fact that some of the shots of the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. The film gets worse with every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of the category "so bad that it's really good". If you really like to fantasize and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books.
