Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government does not believe him (made silly # 1). He builds a shelter in the deep subsoil and is drawing a lot to see who will go. Also, he is willing to kill to save humanity (made silly # 2). With millions of dollars in technology, how could a civilian see what NASA could not? Furthermore, the end justifies the moral means of this story is simply INCORRECT! This movie is unlikely and totally incredible. What was going through these people's minds, why the hell piles of garbage like this get the green light? Sometimes I wonder who has to fuck to make a movie in this city.
