Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, not cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills the Scots! What is this movie? First, I love reading stories about Nessie, marine monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was a cheap jaw scam. No, it was terrible! The story did not make sense, the performance was 100% junk, the only positive side was the great mechanics that Nessie used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations and everything wrong. It's not worth it, just leave it on the shelf (or trash can) where you found it. Second, this movie was filmed in Cailifornia, not Loch Ness, a great dissident for Nessie fans.
