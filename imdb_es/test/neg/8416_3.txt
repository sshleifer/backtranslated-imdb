This is a silly parody of private thrillers, as a novelist (Michael Cain) is called to "write in ghost" an autobiography of a colorful and waning Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes nonsense becomes hateful. This is not the best of Cain. Rooney is very above. Notable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the attractive Nadia Cassini. It is not easy to see.
