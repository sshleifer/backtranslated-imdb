The credits at the end read "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". That is an adequate way to express it because it seems that the material filmed from several projects was compiled in some way, almost without trying to make it all work consistently. It felt more like one of those things in video clips that are marketed as movies to take advantage of those video commercials, except that here we have the commercial music and live performances that are missing, except for one scene, which can also be commercialized as A strange video clip in Japan. Whatever is. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Visually it is also not too special, although it has its moments (for example, the female creature with the "dust of death" that is tied to the base of the bed and some morphing sh!) And certainly has an industrial feeling. the. Usually, I would call the effects diletantish but what this movie offers in this regard is disconcerting more than anything else. Do you remember those cheap video effects of the music videos of the 70s and 80s that make them look so outdated, like an image inside an image flying across the screen? There is quite a lot of this kind of effect on this, and for no apparent reason. The most apparent half-effort comes in the form of a collage of images. The images seem to be album covers. Whatever. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happens with the subtitles of the version I saw. The Chinese (or whatever those hieroglyphics are) sometimes seem to appear when nothing is said and the English often appear without the Chinese. The English subs speak a lot about life without death (is it possible?), And a mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to an understandable conflict between the characters in this film. One man (a scientific type) says that life without meat is death, while another type (a type in metamorphosis) states that his mind is beyond his body now that he has put the "dust of death" on the face and that now knows the secrets. of the flesh and all that; the metamorphosis of the uncle is visibly upset by the affirmation of the scientific uncle. Whatever is. <br /> <br /> Erm, The End - All Written By Perception by Ambiguity
