The movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going crazy. To show that she is mentally ill, she exaggerates a lot and the narrator tells us that she is "going crazy". On the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be Orson Welles' brother and later takes out a headline from a building in one of the few interesting moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little movie that is made very cheap, and it sure looks. The film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap movie) and had some sound effects and a dominant narrative added later. In fact, the narration was the most mocking and involuntarily funniest I've ever heard and is said in such a foolish and exaggerated way that you would have to listen to it to believe it. As a result of these cost reduction actions, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​trying to make this type of film was quite original. Also, it's VERY hard to do it through the whole movie.
