So, while I'm watching this movie, I wonder: could the producers of this film save money in the wardrobe of Sandra Bullock by taking out her "old" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Mrs. Bullock also achieve sleepwalking through the role of channeling the "before" of Gracie Hart? As many critics have pointed out previously, the film is very formulated. Add to that that the viewer lets vu experiment with the character of Cassie Maywether as a darker Gracie Hart with more background story and that quickly becomes a repeating festival. (and better) in other movies. Like the "good boy companion who tries to protect his partner despite the evidence", the character has been seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film reaches beyond the two dimensions or tries to be more than hackneyed stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last complaint: using the term serial killer is false advertising. Killing a person, even if it is a premeditated murder, does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a killer.
