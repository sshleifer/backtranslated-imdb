In case you are wondering, the fool Loren C ***** n of (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a live idiot and any information you have provided should be discarded with the garbage. The guy is just a news paper cutter. <br /> <br /> As for the plot of the story, it was a predictable train shock, the actors were mechanics, the lighting was horrible and the accessories / clothes were cheap. <Br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldwait should have starred in the clowns in this movie. I was physically sick after seeing ten minutes of this. <br /> <br /> There are crazy / retarded monkeys who are still in charge of the movies I watch. <br /> <br /> Dan
