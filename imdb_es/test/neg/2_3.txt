It seems that since 1982, approximately every two or three years we get a movie that says "The next officer and a gentleman". There has not yet been a movie that lives up to this claim and this movie is no different. <br /> <br /> We get the usual scenes from OAAG ("I love you, DOR", says the instructor.) The character of Richard Gere, his overdose of exercises in the hope that he will resign, Gere's character returns for the girl, Gere's character realizes that the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sunrise in the east and horribly miscast at the top. Costner plays his usual character of "wise teacher", the only character he can play, and you really realize his limited acting skills here. Kutcher is terrible in the character of Richard Gere, simply misinformed with acting skills just a notch above Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this aspiring OAAG is that the two main characters are incredibly one-dimensional, never look after yourself as much as possible and when the Kutcher character finally turns around (as Gere did in OAAG) he simply "So what?" The film does not leave a plot point and it seems it never ends as if it said "oh, wait, we forget to close the story of the bride, or what happens after she graduates, or another six points of the plot of the film ... "What is most disconcerting are the great" criticisms "that I see here, the opinions of the general public never cease to surprise me.
