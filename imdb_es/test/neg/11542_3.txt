Simply unpleasant It is almost unbelievable that, with the characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, it could turn out to be such a passionate and passionless hodgepodge. But that's TV for you, stuffed between commercials. The first warning sign sounds of the restlessness of the recreation of the period, which shouts "1928" in the type of banner. Flivvers and cars, fedoras and vests, clanches and clandestine jazz (played in a jocular way): with all the attention paid to useless artistic details, the important issues are ignored. <br /> <br /> As narrative clarity or plausibility, or competent to write and act. The plot establishes one of the agents of Hammett ("Hamilton Nash", therefore, if it is called "Ham" or "Nash", we think of "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating a theft of fake diamonds. This is how she introduces herself to the young woman who supposedly bears the curse of Dain (the toothless Nancy Addison, who returned to the soaps to which she belonged); she belongs to a crazy religious cult directed by Jean Simmons and also seems addicted to "drugs"; There's also a mysterious gaseous drug that seeps into the rooms ... <br /> <br /> But it's enough. Writing is never more pedestrian than when it comes to poetics or high-flying, and the cast repeats it in the only way they know: through a grotesque overexploitation. Simmons is treated like the royalty of Old Hollywood, but the treatment of the great lady does not wash. Hector Elizondo for some reason enjoys a second billing (after Coburn) for a spare part. Other familiar faces move adrift, doing little good on their résumés. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even photographed to look good; Jason Miller is a special horror, but the extreme close-ups of Coburn are also relentless. Coburn probably assumed this role because, with his mustache, he looks a lot like Hammett. I needed more guidance than that; nobody has given him the vaguest clue as to how to interpret his character, or the tone of the story, or how the different lines of the plot come together (they do not, at least not in this narration). So it shows Chesire-cat's big smile, whether it's called or not. <br /> <br /> Dain's curse is available in video, in a variety of lengths. For those reckless enough to "see for themselves," the shortest summary is the kindest of all.
