I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that say gory, non stop action, great movie ... <br /> <br /> These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go !! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to improve and it was in vain. Some said that this movie was brutal and others said bloody, but I can not find any of those adjectives that appear in this. I mean, in hell there are so many scenes with people being shot and there's no blood, it's not even funny! ! I guess the best way to summarize this is that I probably should have been rated PG by 1984 standards and now in 2010 there is no doubt that this would be PG !! Bad, BAD not in the fun variety of "B" cheese!
