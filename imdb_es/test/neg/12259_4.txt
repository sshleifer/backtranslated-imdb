Being a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought it seemed worth trying. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was in TCM, but it consisted only in the Niagara Falls movie, the Miss Polly movie was missing). The talents of the actors, who give excellent performances, It is wasted in one of the stupidest stories in which I have had the bad luck to sit down. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor of the series, but Slim is monopolized by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has any talent, did not show it here . <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great, but does not have a big enough part. The biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under Sam under a table. <br /> <br /> The only one in the movie that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is not reasonable in general. While it is physically quite attractive, its personality and attitudes make it completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel reception clerk are stupid. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly leave their honeymoon suite at the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they return it to him. Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the movie is that they try to escape, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> Towards the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally about to escape, meets a minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Now, the guy, who, as I said, is the only one in the entire movie who has a head on his shoulders, suddenly, for absolutely no reason, he decides he has to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> Drag the minister to the room from which he has just escaped, but Margie does not want to marry him. He kisses her and now, after a kiss, she feels obligated to marry him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam has the courage to tell Tom: "You cheated on me," when practically the only Tom line had to ask Sam before: "We're not married," to which Sam replied: " Do you think he would believe me? " <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
