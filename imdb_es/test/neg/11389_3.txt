***** Spoiler or two, it does not matter. ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out about this movie. First, it was titled "Bruno" and "The dress code", and if you've seen this movie, you'll see the irony in that. <br /> <br /> Second, it's about solving the problems completely. . The adventures of a high school is not something for which there is a great need for a movie, nor a subject that I think most people would be interested in. Shirley MacLaine manages to walk on gender issues by tying Bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion, which probably opens up an even more thorny can of worms, what was she thinking? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some humor and it is not directly offensive, but the kind of disturbing feeling at the beginning continues to grow. Not long ago, except to repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps excepted) no matter what. <br /> <br /> What is good, but for people to live in a society, everyone has to give a little to get along. Bruno not only wants to wear a dress, but wants to look like a miniature Gladys Knight at the awards night, and his latest costume makes him look like a cowgirl doll with a cabbage patch. However, all other children dress and behave, well, like normal children. So, what is it? If that were the case, we could all declare ourselves special or different and behave the way we felt, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of people who are "different" is also pretty well defined, I doubt we'll ever see a movie about a child finding his true self and wanting to wear monkeys, hunt geese and visit the tractor pull it, and demanding that everyone else accept it as it is. "Bruno" is a stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
