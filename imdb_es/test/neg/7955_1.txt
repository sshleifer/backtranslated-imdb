Pathetic NRI Shit ... Appeals to all who are not from India ... This is the WORST of Indian cinema, made by the worst piece of garbage of the NRI ... The story is boring and clich√© (the way that the NRIs and the Westerners see India) ..... Cheer up if you want to be bored of dying. <br /> <br /> The film is about the plight of widows in India before independence. Much of this is true even now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent that it is shown (perhaps because it is a period film) ..... <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian films directed by extremely talented directors that are worth savoring. ... This is a final failure ... Watch a documentary instead or look for information on the web if you are really interested in the situation of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I lost my time.
