I attended a screening of this movie. It was forged with clich√©s and jokes and very funny arrangements. I think the other comments were from people who must have worked on the film or have been family members of the cast. I'm surprised that this movie costs $ 3 $ 4 million without any real star. Where did the budget go? Obviously it was not the writers to rewrite. It is a good idea to trust the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major flaw. There was little or no spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit weak at best. The direction was not inspired and it looked like a student movie. <br /> <br /> I do not even know what it means Everybody wants Italian. Is that a real saying? I've never heard it.
