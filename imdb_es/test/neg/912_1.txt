The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up, to predict and the worst scenario I've seen. I will not do it and I hope I do not buy it. Also seen in seasons ago that the episodes about the space they did, suck even more. All I want to say to the people who do this is: do not do a complete episode about space, because they stink. The point is that season 6 stinks even more than previous seasons. It gets worse from one season to another. I was disappointed and frustrated so much to see the first 4 episodes of season 6 that I had to write this. Only people with brainwashing can see this shit. It seems that the people who write the scenario are coming out of ideas for a long time. Think that my 2-year-old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people.
