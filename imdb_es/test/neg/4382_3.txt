I picked up this movie from the local family video for sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it was not going to be good. When seeing him with 2 friends, none of them wanted to finish it because of how horrible this movie is. I, strangely, could not stop seeing it. But this movie is definitely a case of textbooks on how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and sounds great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to come true one more time. Serial murder, Norris, roundhouse kicks ... this sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And some of that is pretty good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene in which a truck cascades down a precipice and is crushed, is incredible. loose silk. But there are many mistakes with this movie. <br /> <br /> One: the editor is a moron. When making an action or suspense movie, you must keep the energy moving. There are too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot that remains in this film, slowing down and distracting the overall story. They could have cut at least 10 minutes and the pace would have improved and the movie would be a little better. Two: The sound boy is a jerk. Apparently, someone tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can not get a decent sound, so most of the dialogue is expressed, killing the stereo and not aligning with the mouth. Also, the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is an imbecile. They cast Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills Have Eyes and others) and would have been the right serial killer or some kind of villain. His character is so vanished that Drago's skills are lost. Four: The writer is an imbecile. Two plots are in this movie: the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw that woman on the screen, I wanted to take my eyes out. And of course, she never realized the other plot, so her story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Will I ever see this again? Perhaps. But unless you remastered this movie at least a dozen times, you should never do it. Not recommended.
