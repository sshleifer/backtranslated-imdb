I had heard good things about "States of grace" and I came with an open mind. I thought that the "Army of God" was fine, and I thought maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The movie started with a bit of unstable acting, and I thought: "well, maybe it will get better". Unfortunately, he never did it. The image begins with the introduction of two elders, the Mormon missionaries, and it seems that the audience will know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly unlikely series of unfortunate events that highlight the blatant disobedience of the missionaries (something that certainly exists, but rarely at the level portrayed by Dutcher) and becomes almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The only one of Dutcher Success in this movie is his successful alienation from his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher achieves nothing but annoy his predominantly Mormon audience. The movie in no way reflects reality. The missions do not look anything like what Dutcher shows (having served myself on a Mormon mission, I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains a much more explicit language than the occasional slight vulgarity. <br /> <br /> The conclusion, that I guess it was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone, was amazing (come on, the whole mission comes together to see this old man sent home, and the mother and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and corny. Next time, Dutcher, try to make a movie that someone can identify with.
