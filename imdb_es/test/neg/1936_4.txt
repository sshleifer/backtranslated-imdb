My opinion: even the splendid underwater photography can save a family script and thin characters like paper. <br /> <br /> For those who have not yet received enough WILLY photos for FREE, FLIPPER can offer you a decent rental. Others are (very) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless affair, it shows almost nothing for the adult audience (unless it's the first time you see a dolphin). <br /> <br /> A new version of a television show and a 1960 movie, FLIPPER can have a sound like a A good idea back then: a dolphin love the life of a boy and a girl, help protect the environment by getting rid of the toxic waste thrown over the crystal clear waters of the Florida Keys and, at the same time, fight a shark and a salty sea, which is responsible for the toxic spill and also hates the dolphins . But even for the 1990s, especially if a disturbingly similar movie like FREE WILLY was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another summer movie for children, harmless and occasionally empty. Although the animals (this, in his case, is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic looking hammerhead shark, typecast as the villain) and pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there is nothing FLIPPER can steal from anyway. br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, something that even a 6-year-old can find evident today. The cast (human), led by a priest of ELLOS Elijah Wood and an unemployed Paul Hogan, rarely has anything to do except stand up and look pretty. Their acting skills, regardless of what they may be in this film, are rarely revealed on the screen, unless they consider the "acting" talents of the joyous bottlenose dolphins. I guess I do not try to recommend FLIPPER since the meaningless family entertainment will not be fair, but to anyone over 10 years old (No, do that 8), it's better to rent or buy something else. Also, the movie is about 95 minutes maximum. That could give him enough time for something else without worrying about his children. That alone could be worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
