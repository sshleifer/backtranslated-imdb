The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in the main theme of this film, a marvelously insane parody of the song (in my opinion, horrible) "My Favorite Things" of "The Sound of Music". And this little funny detail is not the only aspect that makes alias "The Body Shop". "Doctor Gore" (1973) recommended for my fellow Gore / Trash fans. The movie, which was created almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr., who was a producer, writer, director and protagonist of the same name of Dr. Gore, is a shit, no doubt, but it is also undoubtedly fun, and that everyone involved, probably Patterson especially, was at so much. that they were not exactly doing a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous but totally demented plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife Anitra, a model, in an accident. Along with his hunchback assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), from now on he kidnaps beautiful young women to build a new and perfect wife from their body parts ... <br /> <br /> "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie of the type "so bad is good", but also has qualities that go beyond the usual ridiculous ridicule. Crazy science has always been one of my favorite Horror themes and, in fact, it's also one of the coolest subjects for the ridiculous Gore Trash movies. Obviously filmed on a minimal budget, the "Doctor Gore" pays homage to the "Frankenstein" films, especially James Whale's masterpiece "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the appearance of the first Troma films / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore as "Feast of the Blood" (1963), only that it seems much cheaper and horrible. Obviously J.G. Patterson's motive was not simply to make a funny blood film: being a rather ugly and strange-looking guy, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to kiss with a pair of attractive and barely dressed young women (who then they would end up as donors of body parts in Dr. Brandon's laboratory). <br /> <br /> Most of the blood is really well done with respect to the obviously small budget. The dialogue includes some extremely funny lines ("Take that, it could be the door ... and put on a coat so they do not see you hunchback"). In addition to the theme song mentioned above, "Doctor Gore" also includes a wonderfully horrible appearance of a country band called 'Bill Hicks and the Rainbows', my new favorite band, NO. For the rest of the movie, I kept wondering if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who plays the hunchback attendant, are twins or even the same person. The two look exactly the same, and they have two unrelated obese guys with red beards and look like that. Weird in a movie would be a great coincidence. In addition to J.G. Patterson, most of the cast members never made other movies. This is the first movie I've seen of Patterson's few. Unfortunately, the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> In general, "Doctor Gore" is a film that certainly is not for everyone. In fact, it's total shit. But it is also fun and recommended for my fellow fans of the rare and cheap things. Dictionaries should show a screenshot of this movie below 'trash flick'.
