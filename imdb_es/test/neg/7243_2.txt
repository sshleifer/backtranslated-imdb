There is no direct budget for the history of aliens in Arizona that involves the military and escaped convicts. <br /> <br /> Not bad as such, rather suffer the cast and the team as if they were going through the steps instead of trying to sell it. It's as if they knew they were in a Z-grade movie and they want you to know that they know. Then, again, maybe they simply could not achieve it. <br /> <br /> A misfire of a Z-grade movie that could have been something if someone cared, and had ability. Why do low-budget filmmakers insist on not really trying to do something good instead of just making a product? <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 because nothing comes together
