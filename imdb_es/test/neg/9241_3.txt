Harmony Korrine - Do you hate it or hate it? On this evidence, hating could be a better word. Not him, of course, just everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this movie promise a lot, including a fantastic idea of ​​a Michael Jackson impersonator falling in love with a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Fantastic. And set in Paris! This could be great. But, unfortunately, Korrine can provoke a strange decent idea, but because he is a horrible writer, the story fails at all levels and the passage of the audience I witnessed for about an hour is proof that it is the most boring film and pretentious that exists. . Apparently, the departure rate at its premiere at the Cannes festival last year was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he stupidly changes the story to the confines of a castle to present a group of other imitators who make the whole experience tedious and narratively sterile. When will the independent cinema stop funding this upstart?
