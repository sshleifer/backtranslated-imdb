As much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I asked myself once again, why redo a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of most of Marta. It was a clear scam. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a wounded child who cured himself with love. I could not believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck had this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones should have found another that she could have (she has other roles she does have). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but cheerful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionate in comparison. This version was nice but soft. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added some interesting color that did not seem important. I liked it when he finally said he would come back, but the movie was over before he returned. I mainly have Marta at home. From time to time I visit him again.
