"Problem Child 2" was a complete waste of my time. The original movie was not very good, but it is a classic compared to this movie. The first film reached the top with its scenes of a diabolical child that caused great havoc in the lives of everyone around. Here, it goes even further on top. And a scene in this movie proves that theory. That sequence of walking at the carnival was too much for me to stomach. It is awful. This movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
