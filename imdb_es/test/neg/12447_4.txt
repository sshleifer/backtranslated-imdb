Do not be fooled by the 'prizes' and the comment below. This is just 1 bad movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes him very annoyed to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic unfolding of this. According to the rest of the movie, the character's head seems to be somewhere else. Your emotions do not match the things that happen in the movie. The things he says as a voiceover do not add anything to the movie. It just makes Zeus an even more spineless character with his head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the film were armed with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film were badly stolen from other modern directors. Let's hope Jon Rosten uses his own style and ideas for his future films.
