I enjoyed the beautiful landscapes of this movie the first time I saw her when she was 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is something cute for children in a cheesy way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday mornings, its Swedish funds make it easy for the eyes. Do not expect older children to be interested since the live action / animation is very late and most older children will get bored. This is definitely a film set in under 10s and a good memory for those of us who were little kids in 1974.
