Good attempt to give life to Shakespearean language in a post-apocalyptic environment, but the end result is terrible. Futurist Liverpool is not convincing at all; the budget was obviously not very big, but the production designer could have devised a slightly more creative approach to it. Alex Cox has made some good movies, eg. Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really do not know what I was thinking here. Only one opinion.
