What a deal ... and what a waste. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone, you would expect some quality. However, the movie is a big mess with an unlikely story that seems like it can not stop going around and around. Yes, I think they thought they were really being smart with all this. <br /> <br /> The story is not only messy and unlikely, it is also not exactly very original. Use elements from previous and much better movies based on poker games. But for me, it was really the many useless twists and turns in the movie that they did. It made history so unlikely to see. On top of that, the script is still full of many silly poker game mistakes and things that just do not make much sense. Why does anyone above all things want to play against a card player who is known as the best cheater in the game? This is what the film is about, but it just never made much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a great cast, it still feels as if most of the actors were miscast in their roles. I do not know what Stuart Townsend is about. He is a good actor, but in most of the roles he plays, he always feels out of place. Maybe it's their looks, I do not know them. Basically, this was also the reason why he was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." In addition, Thandie Newton is not very good and is actually quite upset in her "strong" female role. And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this? Oh, I suppose I could go on talking about the movie, and I can complain even more about the limited screen time the character of Jamie Foxx has, but I think you understand my point. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is simply not an original writer / director and also does not handle his own material very well. The scenes often feel disconnected, they try to put too many characters and everything about the film is superficial and in a predictable way. In addition to that, the film presents some incorrect editions at times, which also does not help this film to be seen as a whole. The movie was also a big box-office bomb and it's no wonder that Damian Nieman has not made a movie since then. <br /> <br /> A disaster too big to make you enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
