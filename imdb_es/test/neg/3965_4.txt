A man is taken from a street in London and taken to a foreign country where he is tortured as a suspect in terrorism. The boring and banal movie bored me very much. More an idea than a movie. I was halfway through this 77-minute movie when I realized I had no idea who was someone on the screen. It was as if they took all the other similar films and took out all the ideas and put them in a place without the real notion of character. Certainly, it is well acted with passion, but there is no emotional center, there is only one man of all kinds that the filmmakers believe is enough. It is not. And while the story presents the id in theory as an important warning, the film is too boring to convince any of it, especially if one has seen the other, better films of a similar kind (interpretation with Reese Witherspoon, for example)
