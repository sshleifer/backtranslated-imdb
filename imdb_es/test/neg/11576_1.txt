I was watching the science fiction channel when this pile of smoking garbage appeared. While it's not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of the Komodo", this still stinks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in "Curse of Komodo", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are first class (amazing) but that's all ........ I do not know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yes! As in "Curse of the Komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! Also ... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (Part man, komodo and cobra!). In general, this movie is a total shit even in bad movie standards. Just remember that if Jim Wynorski had something to do with a movie ... stay away ... to avoid falling asleep, repeat "It's almost over ... it's almost there ...". 0 out of 5
