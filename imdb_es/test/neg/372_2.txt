I arrived at "Steel Frontier" about 8 minutes before turning it off. Then, glutton for the punishment that I am, I looked a little more the next day. Today I had to iron a lot of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie, and that was his own punishment. This is what I do not understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth spent $ 7,000 each on their debut features and created two notable films. However, here we have two directors with much more money, and they produce a huge and smoky pile of garbage. Let me see if I can understand the logic: "It's 'Road Warrior' but it's like a Western future, we'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll have our mentally disabled cousin write the script, we'll spend the budget on a lot of explosions We can not lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I do not think even the MST3K guys can not improve this. But if you insist on seeing it, I recommend you get drunk a lot.
