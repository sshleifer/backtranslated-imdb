Calling "Rocketship XM" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its clever ability to capitalize on the advertising of "Destination Moon" and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Mike of Sea Hunt. . Nelson, the father of Rockford and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad enough to be a good forage for MST3K and looks better with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the type of movie that best suits to add riffs of MST3K characters; something preacher, slow, badly written, and full of painfully bad acting. While unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" do not lend themselves to satirical comments (because the movie constantly surprises the hosts), really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So add some stars to the ranking if you are viewing the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn on the moon and ending on Mars. What they find on this planet are the remnants of a civilization similar to the human devastated by an atomic war. Only a Martian is shown in the foreground, a normal-looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. The men resemble the "thugs" in the old Popeye cartoons, run nimbly around the cliffs and throw stones at the crew with amazing accuracy, especially if they are supposed to be blind. Of course, none of this is explained, since doing so would require some sign of logical analysis on the part of the writers of the script. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are presented in something called "sepia color" to distinguish them from the rest of the film in black and white. If this makes you think "Wizard of Oz", you will be disappointed because it is just a black and white material with a slight brown tint added to the post-production impression. <br /> <br /> In keeping with moronic sexism From the movie, the scientific refrigerator ruins their fuel calculations, both come and go. The fact of not being up to the men makes her feminine side come to the surface and she and Mike Nelson lull each other as they face their condemnation (insert the arch sound here). <br /> <br /> The real stars of the movie are the reporters in the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to greet especially these little-known heroes. The intrepid "newsies" squads present themselves during the first 10 minutes of the film, then take stations about 12 centimeters from the technicians and monitoring teams in the command center. Later, they are asked to ask the stupid questions that the director of the mission needs to expose the already obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extremely low audio level, is not subtitled and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you will appreciate that they only last 77 minutes, they still last about 60 minutes, since any 30 minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has several times more content than this whole movie. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
