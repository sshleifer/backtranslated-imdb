I saw this movie at the theater in Edinbourgh along with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time. We would have preferred to spend more than an hour to see the vague dialogue of Star Wars III that played in the hallway that all this. <br /> <br /> Opening up with one of the worst jokes I've seen committed to celluloid on the big screen, it did not go off. Throughout the film, we had the feeling that the jokes were trying too hard, the writers thought about the configuration so much that you could see the joke 2 minutes before, then when it came, it was so dazzling that you could not even smile . ; I quote the cum-ming giraffe as a good example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself makes me think of some interesting thoughts that entertained me much more than what was happening on the screen. I think you could have done much more with that angle (the two different worlds, the experience of the characters out of the water, confusion and surprise when people try to understand and distinguish the characters and writers from each other). ) But a lot of time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say that sixteenth-century characters show that any extra talent from writers is an insult to smart writers and editors who could possibly have made this film a valuable 40-minute idea; But no, it's a torture film of unhappiness. <br /> <br /> When we were leaving the theater, which had very little laughter inside, I heard the young British electro-shock couple behind me saying, "That was pretty good, was not it? it was known what was coming next. " And the girl replies "yes, quite surprising". and that was it. If this is what the British are supposed to avoid when watching a comedy: not to laugh for 90 minutes, but a bit of communication between two lovers at the end, then this movie was successful. But I have more faith in British life than that. <br /> <br /> I have not laughed so much in a comedy film since American Pie II.
