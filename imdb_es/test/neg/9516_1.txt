This movie was so frustrating to watch. Split screens do not allow you to get too involved in the emotions of the actors. I went and came constantly looking at all these little images that I found with a wiplash at the end. This is basically a scam of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode." I was very disappointed that the filmmakers tried to be great. I wish I had gone out like so many other people did.
