Children's show of the sixties with former vaudevilians who interpret able men for hire. As you can expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. Over the course of the 11-minute episodes (which leave 4 minutes for commercials in the 15-minute time slot), they do things like set up a fence between neighbors at war, help a magician on stage and deal with a trunk and a portfolio found. <Br /> <br /> Growing up, I had never met this show (which seems to have been filmed in New York). I thought that I had heard or seen most of the children's shows of the time, either having seen them as a child or seen in the conventions of nostalgia. Until Alpha Video released it on a DVD, I completely did not know if it existed. <br /> <br /> The show is presented as the Three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello, just as the people who imitated the routines did. (In fact, one of the two says to have created the legendary routine "Slowly I turned ..." that Abbott and Costello perfected). It's not bad, but it's not good either, since everything seems diluted. Time is often off (although that may be due to bad direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the show was published for the first time. Most likely, you've seen it all before. On the positive side, it's the kind of thing that would be perfect for introducing very young children to the magic of vaudeville style comedy, however, it will try to make parents feel comfortable even with short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only for addicts to nostalgia. Everyone else should see an original by Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
