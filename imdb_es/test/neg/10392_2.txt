This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. A friend of mine took it from the shelf in the video rental store and almost forced me to see it, an action that we both deeply regret. Ehh ... Where to start? Writing, acting, quality? All that, sucked. <br /> <br /> Possibly some of the worst writings that have been shown in a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it could be in the movies. Bold dialogue, like "how are you?" ... "not so good, doc" (immediately after an attempt to exorcize a man's daughter and after his wife's attempted suicide, of course it's not so good). Points, something funny. If it is not horribly written, planned and obvious. The general plot of the film, the writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was as if the writers could not think of anything better to do, then write a bunch of shitty dialogues and throw as many sex scenes and nudes as they could at random. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed one and the Peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like cheap pornography than a movie. Oh, yes, and they never really got the writing. <br /> <br /> The performance? Horrible. x100 I think the only good actor was the short Spaniard who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst performance? It could be said that Paul Kappellas, whose performance combined with shitty music, a gun and a half-naked bluish-white girl running through the woods, made the film almost unbearable to sit on. He even ruined his own death scene, one that should have been easy to catch. Although, the performance of most of the others was also horrible. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters also added to the overall level of the film. There were only enough characters for almost half of the characters to die, the same number of people were possessed at a given time, and then the remaining characters could not be counted on one hand. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What about the climax of the exorcism movies happening in a barn, anyway?
