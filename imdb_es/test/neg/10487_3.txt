What? - that was it? Does the city sheriff (John Agar) exploit the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? I just saw that? <br /> <br /> With the instrumentals of The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is a movie that never deserved to be made in 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was over, and anyone who was not Ray Corrigan in an ape Costume is just asking problems. Do this again in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you would have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb. But unfortunately, he should never have had the opportunity to see the light of day. Wow, there is another peculiarity: you can never tell if it is day or night in history, since they seem interchangeable with each other. <br /> <br /> However, I will give you this, a couple of the first malt shops. The scenes seemed to have gone on the air as Coca Cola commercials. Thinking about it now, those were probably the most beautiful scenes and with the best aspect of the image; Coca Cola must have paid for them. If they had seen the whole movie, they could have been better served to avoid its release.
