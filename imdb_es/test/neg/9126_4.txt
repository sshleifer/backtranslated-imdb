The final frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide one-line summaries of the destinies of the four central male characters in the film. Although somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters, the end of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most fervent fan of the film would want. However, someone felt that mega-dollars could be obtained by detailing the sad lives of these characters after the original movie ended. Bad move. Making an insurance salesman and his wife, a private nerd in Vietnam, a drag racing driver, and a too-large hippie in interesting characters in interesting situations were far beyond the talent of those who wrote this film almost impossible to see. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a disaster of silly situations involving protests, auto racing, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, which were once considered innovative and daring, is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to already confused events. This is a sequel that shows almost everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Maybe it should be projected in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, is badly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", see the original twice.
