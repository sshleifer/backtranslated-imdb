Quentin, in my opinion, has written and directed just one good movie and that was the award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most of the films, especially the recent ones, have been real peacocks. People still rate him and his things today and I really can not see why. Currently, there are many other directors and writers who produce much better entertainment in all aspects of their films. From this moment, I will not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse yet you felt it. The humor was, well, minimal and not so humorous. The violence was nothing new (except the final scene). The dialogue was sometimes VERY prolonged. <br /> <br /> Some will love this movie; and for others, they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought that the Nazis theme was finally over with the incredible German film Der Untergang of 2004.
