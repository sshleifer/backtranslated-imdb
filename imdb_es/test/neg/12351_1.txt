I saw this in a preview and I have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of guts I've seen. <br /> <br /> Completely ungraceful, low budget, boring, garbage, terrible script - The whole audience (young and old) sat through the film in a coma without laughing most of the time .. There were literally only about 2 places where you'll laugh in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> A lot of people are left halfway - Can 'I blame them ... I kept thinking that the movie would resume, however, he never did and wished I had left. <br /> <br /> The humor was very scarce and I am surprised that this has reached the big screen. I am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie, it just was not funny. The people who made this movie really do not deserve your money, so do not pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not even funny enough to be seen on television, let alone for the cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give you 0 out of 10, but the system does not allow it ...
