Last night I watched this movie with a group of friends at a Halloween party. I have to say that the sarcastic comments never ended and I have to say that they were well deserved. Although I felt that the address was well done, the madness in their dialogue is simply too much cheese. I think I spent about an hour on this before I even started to realize that the important thing was that they were trying to drive home. You realize pretty quickly that this whole family is pretty peculiar and something is wrong with them, it's a bit too slow. This movie could have lasted about 45 minutes and have been much better. The only thing that made it bearable were the two bottles of wine I threw during the course of the film. Bring people from slasher movies, because at least I know what to expect from them. This was not my thing, too dark humor, and the topic of cannibalism was a bit explicit and rude. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as he could have been, and I will give him the support for that, since I usually see him as a drunken fool or a shattered fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this horror / comedy movie a very generous 3 out of 10.
