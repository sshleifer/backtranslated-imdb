This movie was not very good in my opinion. While it's not a complete waste of an hour and a half (fortunately I did not have to pay $ for it), it just was not very scary. There were parts where I jumped and some scenes minimally violent / bloody, but in general only a person who was easily scared would consider this movie scary. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in general were very weak. The characters never evolved or grew as people. Even in the end, the leader, whatever his name was, did not become a man and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had inconsistencies. The police officer who was killed was NOT murdered in the same way that he died in the game. The girl October mentioned that to kill the evil demon, you had to read some of the correct text. It's funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape. The child Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game but did not die "in real life". Also, making the game on its own was very weak writing. It would have been good for the brother's death, only to have them play again. But you're supposed to play a video game and stay alive, and 3 people die before playing again ... why do you need the game? If you like movies like the ring and your fear and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can see him laughing, do it. If you like "horror" movies that make you laugh out loud and have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, stay far away.
