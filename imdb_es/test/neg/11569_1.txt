I was so "impressed" with Tim Kincaid's MUTATING HUNT that I gave him a chance. It is the near future, post apocalypse, of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins a group of similar-looking fighters to challenge The Dark and his subordinate Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a large spider's leg and some clumsy robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the ROBOT HOLOCAUST is just up (or down) at the HUNT level. To reach a painful time of 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is a cheap movie. The sets have all the elaborate design of a haunted carnival house and the costumes show that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of old buildings full of rubble and Central Park. The headquarters of The Dark One is sinisterly called The Power Station and looks, well, like a power station. The acting is universally bad, except for Angelika Jager as the evil Valaria. Jager is all an 'other level of evil. Despite being sick of Cherman, she gives such an incredibly bad performance that it becomes the only reason to recommend this movie. She also offers the only nudity of the film in the "pleasure camera" section of the film. Ed French again supplies the effects of the robots, but they are not as viscous as their work in MUTANT HUNT.
