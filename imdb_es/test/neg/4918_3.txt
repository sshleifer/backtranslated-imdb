Oh darling. This sequel has a mirror, this time, that houses the evil spirit of a psychopath who murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville house. The mirror captured all the horrible incident of the horrified family who did not have time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) by a vagabond (who happens to be his crazy father and the man responsible for killing the family) and the evil soon terrifies those in a loft (.. like Keyes' painter, friend Suki, played by Julia Nickson-Soul, where he lives when he is investigated, soon Keyes is having nightmares, looking through his father's eyes as he shoots the family in cold blood, worried that he might Following his steps, he soon sees other events through his father's eyes, like the terrible days when his mother's head is hit on the floor of an institution or they experience a moment inside the cell when a doctor administered a medication to immobilize it. <br /> <br /> Quite solid the cast of support that deserves more than being caught in junk like this, like David Naughton (the American werewolf in London) as owner of the loft Keyes lives with , Richard Rou ndtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist -Detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious and quite strange nurse-secretary in the asylum (the one who stopped Keyes' father) will soon be shut down. <br /> <br /> Rounding out the film, The sexy and shy Lala Sloatman as Keyes' support girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday the 13th: The final chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (... was about to start a romance with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic Demon who tries to provoke his son into murder. innocent people like he did, and Robert Rusler (A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (... from Nickson-Soul) who encounters an unfortunate disappearance while tearing pictures as a revenge for his dismissal. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effects movie that simply uses the Amityville title as cash. For starters, the franchise has never been so good, but as each sequel lit up in green, it got worse. After the third movie, the furniture of the infamous house becomes "possessed" items that torment people. However, the cast strives, but the material (a mirror that causes chaos and murder through supernatural means) lacks quality ... and the rather mediocre special effects do not help. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work, shows why he is such a good actor, that he can even shine in excrements like this. All is not lost, you can see Sloatman always dressed in super short skirts (or his man's shirt in panties), showing his legs along ... you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film of the franchise! The coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by the Nickson-Soul artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking at them.
