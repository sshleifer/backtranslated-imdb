Worst. Movie. Forever. I can not believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to give this piece of shit some credibility, and they still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book, their target audience would not be able to solve it on their own? (probably). "Hey, let's blow up a lot of things and give Mina big boobs, and make her speak in an adorably fake English, that will make the imbeciles see." "But sir, that's not how the book works, I think we're being true to Mr. Wells's message." "Fuck, we're going to the box office here, regardless of the ideas of a dead author on human nature, and add Orlando Jones with a classic 'black attitude' as a supporting character, and it does not matter what's interesting. Guy Pierce has to get some money at the end. "
