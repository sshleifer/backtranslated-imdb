Nothing will surpass KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (!), But KvC is not as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel. Just make sure you see him while you're drunk or drugged, or while you're trying to fall asleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: a group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. The giant creatures that came in contact with the vegetables have seized the island and eaten them all. So now the government is preparing to fly the island, regardless of the people who are there. The performance is wonderfully atrocious, especially a general mustache from the series THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV, but this is typical of this type of block made for cable. CGI creatures are TV level, which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters. However, two of the girls in the group are very cute, and it's worth watching them as they run here and there in their tight little suits. You just want to eat them!
