This documentary was boring and quite stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the documentalist obviously does not even know how Darwinian evolution works. It is a theory, and the name is simply silly. Reading a college biology textbook could have told the documentary maker what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil is done as a policy. <br /> <br /> There was also no real evidence in this documentary that only interviewed some people ... there are no expert testimonies or suspicious clues ... <br /> <br /> The documentary was also boring. I mean it could have been edited at 35 minutes, and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are many better documentaries than this ... this was not worth seeing ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D DO NOT MISS YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME!
