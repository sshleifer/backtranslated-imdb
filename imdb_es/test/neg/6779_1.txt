The problem with this, and with all the films of the Vietnam War, is that they are too biased. Anti-war films overlook the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while war films ignore the fact that many of the soldiers committed atrocities such as this movie. This movie sucks. It is time for a film that is neither pro war nor war, neither liberal nor conservative, but FULLY UNQUESTIONED.
