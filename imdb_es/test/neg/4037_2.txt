I let a friend convince me to watch this movie, and all I can say is that I want to kill that friend. <br /> <br /> That is an hour and a half of my life that I will never return and I will always regret it. <br /> <br /> If you have also had the bad luck to see this movie, you will agree with me that this is the worst movie ever made, NEVER! <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie and are thinking about watching it, let me save you a waste of time and warn you: DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE, SUCK! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the intent of comedy and sensuality, it just becomes stupid, nasty and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are attractive and attractive and not fat, ugly and disgusting! <br /> <br /> The acting is ridiculous, as is writing. Obviously, this was done by total fans, I can not believe that these people were allowed to make such a stupid movie, is not there a law against that? There should be. <br /> <br /> There is a whole series of good "b" movies if you like that kind of thing, but do not waste your time in this fucking aspirations movie. <br /> <br /> PEACE
