Corey Haim will never be known as one of the best actors of his time, but at least in films like "Licensed To Drive", he had more interest in his element ... low profile humor. <br /> <br /> The book "Observers" by Dean Koontz was one of his previous works and probably his best to date. Unfortunately, this magnificent story of a brilliant dog, a deranged mutant and a genetic experiment that went awry was horribly destroyed. The acting is so inert, you might think you're watching a zombie movie. Only the dog offers a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you'd better see "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... it's fine, maybe not "CHOMPS" <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you have not read the book, read it and avoid this movie. Later you will thank me. <br /> <br /> A better translation of a book by Dean Koontz is the capable thriller, "Phantoms".
