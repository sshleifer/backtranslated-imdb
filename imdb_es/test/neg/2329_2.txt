A colleague at work told me to watch this movie, since I considered this one of the best films in history. So I saw it. First I must admit that I do not like conventional movies and I prefer to watch movies with real meaning. <br /> <br /> And this is the point, why I do not like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of fun, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and exciting pieces. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought that this movie could be a real suspense novel (as the German package says), but it was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images, but the composition tastes as horrible to me as a combination of milk and beer. Both by themselves are pretty good, but together?
