The first time I saw this show was fine. There were some fun times and I laughed a couple of times, but this show is getting worse and worse. The web show of Carly and Sam is not fun at all. They play a stupid Internet video, they shout at the camera and they make very bad jokes. And then the hint of laughter goes off? One problem with the program is that none of the main characters is fun. Carly is not funny. The performance of Miranda Cosgrove is, at best, mediocre. His performance in this show is nothing like the performance of Drake And Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and rude, and the program is written in a way that makes her look like a kind of hill. I mean they make jokes about their mother driving an old, rusty truck, her mother breaking an old television with a bat, and then there are jokes about Sam's failure at school, getting arrested all the time and running away from the police . None of that is funny at all. Then there's Freddy, who is a computer geek. It is not very funny unless your mother treats you like a baby. The only full-time character in the show is Carly's brother, Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things, like pretending to drive a spaceship while making spaceship noises, knocking down an explorer girl's cookie table for revenge, since they did the same to him. Your material is the only thing worth laughing about. Apart from the characters, other things also make the show bad. Like the fact that a couple of kids who make a local web program from an apartment in Seattle is a worldwide success and got them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is, how can a 26-year-old single guy with no real job pay for a 2-level apartment in downtown Seattle, raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment that includes a projector and a remote control? A green screen and an HD camera? This seems to have been written by a 10-year-old boy. The worst thing is that the show contains quite questionable content. There are a couple of times when Carly (remember a 13-year-old girl) appears on her internet show in a bikini. WTF? Then I saw an episode in which Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "slept ONLY his socks the night before". I mean WTF? Then there is an episode in which Carly's rival, Nevel, blackmails her by taking the rights to her website and agrees to return the site in exchange for a kiss. Horrifying! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who has just moved into his apartment building and has some kind of back injury, takes off his shirt and Carly is left drooling over him. I can not believe that Nick even allowed them to show that kind of stuff and I can not believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This program is not appropriate for children under 12 and that is even questionable. iCarly is just another addition to the long list of Nick's horrible programming.
