Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the movie follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I do not really "understand" Samuel Jackson acting most of the time in his other films, but he was quite good at this movie. He rarely shouted and went much further in his character instead of returning to an "anger in his face". I liked Eva Mendes, as usual, and although it is a great treat, she proves to be much more than that as an actress. Luis Guzm√°n was also really good, except that I did not like the character change towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can one focus on disgust for a former cop and then turn into paddleboard in a fraction of a second? Is there no original thought in Hollywood?
