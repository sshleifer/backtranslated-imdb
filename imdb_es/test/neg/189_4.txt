In 1904, a wealthy American woman and her two sons from Tangier are kidnapped by Berbers, desert assassin pirates who despise the Moroccan government and, in doing so, kidnap the "American pestilence", which attracts the attention of the president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt The fictional historical epic is less a great adventure than a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive, retreat to the films of the desert sheikh of the 1940s (with a bit of "The King and I" as well). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen, who portray the undercover, mustachioed and bloodthirsty leader, and his captivating and cautious prisoner, could act in two completely different movies (neither of them seems to know how far it is to bring the elements of the camp of his characters and dialogues, and both seems singularly without the proper direction). The various (and anonymous) cuts and decapitations that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the big scenes of action become blurred, noisy mounts of violence dragged by the sand on horseback. The advantages: a musical score highly praised by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nominee, but loser of "The jaws" by John Williams), excellent filming and cinematography. * 1/2 of ****
