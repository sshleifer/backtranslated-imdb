Okay, I usually do not add comments to the movies, but I finally saw a movie that was so full of nonsense and riddled with incompetence that I had to warn people about. Blackwater Valley Exorcist is about a battered woman / pederast / priest and this podunk family of horse fanatics, and to summarize the story of the youngest daughter who was bothered by the priest but who is in love with the hand of Hillbilly Ranch, is possessed Along with a heroic god who rejected a Mexican gardener who once participated in an exorcism, the wife / pederast / priest manages to save the day, but not before the demon possessor can jump to a prostitute that the sheriff of the city ​​made him hit. . In general, this movie is the biggest bunch of useless (it could be very descriptive with this part, but why waste my energy on this movie) that I've never seen? Any and all people involved in the making of this film must be sterilized so that they can not contaminate the earth with their useless monster.
