This documentary was not made either professionally or objectively. Everything developed as an IBM conspiracy theory to win the game in question just to earn some money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was inflated before the game and when he lost, he did not like it. I remember playing chess against computers in the 80s and it was not that difficult to win. With the passage of time, I began to lose and I did not like it. Today, I just do not play against computers anymore because they are too good. Not only that, the games are not interesting and lack the appeal of human games, where both parties are more likely to make mistakes and open the game to exciting possibilities. This documentary continues to show us images of The Turk, which is an old chess automaton that was really controlled by a human being. From the beginning to the end, we are led to believe that IBM literally hid a human GM on the back of his computer the size of a closet. I am a computer scientist and I am offended by the idea that just because Garry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It is not magic and it is no mystery. They can be trained, have a lot of chess knowledge and certainly see positions and possibilities with unprecedented details compared to humans. It's really no wonder that Deep Blue has won. Maybe at the moment it was. If it happened today, given the increasing processing power of the machines; people would just blink. If a machine could not at least draw with a GM today, people would think that the program was weak.
