I tried to give this show a try, but it really does not feel good. Although the performances are good, writing is not. The two older half-brothers, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we should be on Casey's side, since she is the protagonist, but I do not find her anything pleasant. Parents are continually portrayed as totally clueless. The three smallest children are the most visible things in the program; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet because of the way they come together, and Marti is adorable. The lines of the plot are a bit unlikely and the general premise is mostly difficult to swallow: mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really trying to mix. In general, I think it qualifies with the thumbs down.
