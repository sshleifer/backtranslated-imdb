Two one-page lads working on a radio network go from trying to solve murders to acting a black face between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this 1945 novel. They talk a lot, everyone shouts at everyone, and the two guys on the page call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a true "shortie" at 59 minutes, and has the feeling of being adapted from a work, since it mostly takes place at a radio station. We do not really care about any of the characters, so that's probably why it's almost never shown. It is not a big thing. This was Phil Karlson's second film as director. We are not given any clue as to who might be pulling people, so we simply follow the police detective and the guys on the page, as they all try to solve the mystery first. I will not say more to not give away any spoilers.
