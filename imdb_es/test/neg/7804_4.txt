Anupam Kher is an excellent actor, he debuted at age 28 playing 50 years at SARAANSH <br /> <br /> He now becomes a director with OJJ <br /> <br /> The film has a good plot but it is regressive <br /> <br /> The theme has been killed and Urmila's character seems too active, while the tracks of Anil-Mahima and Abhi- Tara are too sudden and forgotten <br /> <br /> The movie He advances by leaps and bounds and begins to crawl, but there are several good scenes, such as the complete conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek, where Fardeen says to sell the house. <br /> <br /> Abhishek was caught for a crime and Anil screams <br /> <br /> The climax is too much, although <br /> <br /> Director Anupam shows potential, but there is still a way to go. The music is good <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor excels in his part as he always tries Fardeen is fine and well, but he needs to improve. Abhishek is excellent, this was a turning point, people realized that they can act. Urmila is fine. Mahima and Tara are wasted. Waheeda is good.
