This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera tilts very slowly downwards and then back in place again. The sound is crispy, and from time to time it fades again. In another scene, the man in the camera only sees himself in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene with instructions on how to put a tent ... which, believe me, lasted for centuries and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most of the scenes were prolonged with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion, these were just to complete the film and make it longer. Even with these scenes added, it was very brief. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this was the severed head, which looked quite realistic.
