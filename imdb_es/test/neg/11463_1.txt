I realize that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is aimed at a much wider audience. But then, why bother calling it "Solomon Kane" in the first place when the name does not have commercial value? The characters certainly have NOTHING at all to do with the R.E. Character of Howard. Except that he has a big hat. That's where the resemblance ends. <br /> <br /> It's always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / science fiction movie persists in a story of origin, but when you invent a complete cloth like this for a character who did not. You do not have one at all, you have already lost the point completely. Kane is not even the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories, but an ancient villain who tries to save his soul (this part is in the initial scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic elements of the characters. changed or simply ignored, the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply disconcerting. Is it just so they can say "From the creator of Conan" and hope to connect to a budding franchise if the new "Conan" movie takes off? Ignoring the complete deviation of the stories, the film is competent if it is totally generic for the first half, but then becomes pure stupidity in the climate scene involving several super evil (think of three "boss levels" at the same time ), none of which is the least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I were not a Kane fan who was disappointed to have completely ignored the original material, I would probably give the film a 3 or a 4 instead of a 1. Even for the majority of viewers They will come to this without knowing anything about Kane, it's a pretty fine offense.
