When you read the commentary on this movie, it's a smart and funny political comedy based on real events; the only true word here is that it is a comedy. If they tell you that it is an insider movie about Russian politics, it is not. There is probably only 2% in the film of what really happened in Russia during that election campaign. In fact, in 1996, it was a thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a true fashion electoral campaign. Well, there were public relations advisers from the United States who worked on Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the film, it would be much more fun to show all the president's people across the country with paper boxes full of cash, and the celebrities who provide the shows to support to Yeltsin all over the place, in At least that would be true. I give him three just for the respect of Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about the machine guns in the streets of Moscow. He lived in the place that had the most serious crimes in Russia in the mid-1990s and had never seen a man with the gun in the street.
