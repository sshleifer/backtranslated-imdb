Okay, first of all there may be a SPOILER here, since I do not know what it means to give too much information. My subject line says it all, but surely people will want to know WHY it is so stupid. <br /> <br /> First, this movie follows a group of Yuppies when they go to a sports game in Chicago, but they end up taking the wrong exit and liquidation in the ghetto. Fear, huh? Well, first of all, Emilio is driving everyone in the most exaggerated RV / Winnebago in the world, tricked with parabolic antennas and trash like that. So these guys are going to a sports game (I do not remember which one, although it's likely that the Bulls or the White Sox are near the ghetto), but they can not even get to the highway without having an on-board visualization command center that I would put ESPN to shame. However, they are smart enough to earn a living that would pay for things, but they are fanatics of sports who do not even know which way they go to the game they love so much. <br /> <br /> I gave up on the movie half an hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. They end up in GHETTO, but their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A white boy. I'm not racist, but let's go. In anything that REMEMBER reality, and this movie was trying to be an urban nightmare, Denis Leary would not try to kill Emilio EstÃ©vez, he would be hitching a ride to get the shit out of Dodge! /> <br /> This is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although I am not familiar with much of the rest of the world cinema. If MST3K was still on, they probably would have dedicated an episode to it.
