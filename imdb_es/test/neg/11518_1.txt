I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit down and watch this movie completely depressing. The story of the film is not depressing, but the whole movie itself is extremely grim. The performance was absolutely terrible. The children were too teary. A metal pole could have done a better job. I desperately wanted to fall asleep, but since television was so high, I did not have peace. The monkeys are neither cute, nor funny. The drama is worthy of laughter. I do not remember when I saw a more frightening movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely false. Adults try to be good actors, but it seems that they can not break the stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the film for falling off a hill during the movie to leave her, I do not blame her. Micheal Anderson should publicly apologize for this movie. Not only for me, but for everyone else who was forced to sit through this horrible movie. In fact, I apologize to you. Even if it had nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this movie, because this means that at least someone will. This film even overcomes the sadness of Rob Schneider's movies and the Cheetah Girls. I would even say it's even worse than Hilary Duff's movie collection, but that's pushing it. Simply, please, do not watch this movie, or you will be pushed to write a similar review about how horrible this movie is. So sorry.
