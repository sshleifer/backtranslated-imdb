This is a horrible movie. it is mute past First, the only thing that matters to the twins is how they look and what the children like. They are in 7th grade. I do not want to say that I'm an idiot or something, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. Being beautiful and popular is not everything. But that's what the twins make it. The plot is even worse. The grandfather of the girl is the ambassador (sp?) Of France. He has a co-worker who takes the girls to Paris and they meet two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. They make fun of knowing the guys, who really like ETC ... they meet a supermodel in the process and they go through Paris with strangers who think they're cute. Do I need to say more? This movie can be cute for 8 and 9 year olds. The twins play with small losers who want boyfriends. The wrong idea is sent to the girls The film itself is not great either. I do not recommend this to anyone. I give passport to paris 2/10
