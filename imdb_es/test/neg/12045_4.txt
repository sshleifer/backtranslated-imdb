I saw this movie when it first came out and I hated it. I just saw him again 27 years later. In fact, I liked it a little ... although Robin Williams was totally wrong with the paper ... What I remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the opposite of what I had understood when I read the book. Since I have not read it again, I can only give you my impressions of the past, but I am sure of one thing: the film is a song of family life, while in the book, almost ALL traditional institutions, including, and perhaps especially, the marriage - it shows that they are power jackets that we would be well rid of. The only positive thing about the book is the wonderful nature of the children ... something that only the beginning and the end of the film really capture (with that incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air.) Unfortunately, Williams does not have a tenth of his lifetime). Enchanting!) My lowest note is, therefore, that the film misrepresents the book. As a movie in itself, it does better, but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful, I think anyone who sees her will fall in love with her. And John Lithgow, as a former soccer player who has had a sex change operation, is fantastic ... he never camped or made the character praiseworthy, and as such, his performance had incredible integrity. I watched him closely during all his scenes, and never once was anything but feminine. Nothing in his performance approached the performance of a drag queen ... and that made the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one that is irreproachable. It's worth watching this movie just for its performance.
