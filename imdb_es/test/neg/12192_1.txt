I love to dislike this movie. My colleagues always do everything possible to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this must be treasured. Here are some of the main reasons why: A: The plot goes from the hijacking of a road trip film to a slasher movie in a strip bar inhabited by vampires without any configuration. Suddenly, something very real becomes very false, which is like sitting down at a Thanksgiving feast and then exploiting it with dynamite. B: That Juliette Lewis without talent is in that. C: The prepucious ideas abound, like the real guitars of torso and leg, the brothers with the last name "Gecko", the makeup works of bad vampires, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?) And a weapon based on the crotch that it only shoots when "erect" and belongs to a guy who says "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez had not pathetically tried to be so innovative with his violence, he could have amused me with this obvious popcorn movie. The whole project is as if I had the ideas playing with action figures. The only thing that is about to be considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's cheesy, loud monologue after he kills his blood sucking brother, horny for children, of terrible action. I swear I think they thought about it at that moment. This movie is to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible movie
