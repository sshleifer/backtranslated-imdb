It's funny how instinct warns you of something. For example, as soon as the company credits read Nu Image, I knew instinctively that I had seen a shitty movie for them somewhere before, but I could not remember where. However, I only knew that JUDGE AND JURY were going to be crap and it was. Maybe I'm a psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is quite violent, as several people are surprised by the simple fact of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but I'm a little fed up with the exploitative violence on the screen today along with the bad language, especially if the actors are as bad as the ones in this movie. Anyway, the plot revolves around that the bad guy is executed and reeks of the revenge of the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night? Yes, he is a serious mofo. In fact, he's so bad (and I do not mean acting - I'll get to that in a moment) that it's impossible to take him seriously and this is before he's executed just to come back as Elton John. Elvis, a French chef etc. I wonder if Keith David was paid for this. because he seems to be having so much fun on the screen that is the only reason he plays the role. What a pity that this critic has not been amused at all seeing JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers could send me Keith's fare? Gawd only knows that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie very much as if you had not guessed it and my main problem is not with the stupid argument or the cheap production values, but with its attitude toward violence. . If like me, you have broken a bottle of wine on your head or have kicked your ribs very hard several times, you will know that violence is an obscene and painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will make you believe that if you are expelled a window, go through some railings and fall twenty feet on a table, not only you will hurt yourself but you can overcome a couple of rabid rabid dogs. Of course, one could argue that any movie starring Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest display of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY, he pulled my chain.
