Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I've seen in my life. It is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what is happening here. The camera is used to meddle, dishonor and ridicule. There is no magic flow here, there is no sense of greatness or respect. Instead, some scenes are improvised without a purpose or greater plan. The music is disturbing. Just when I rate Koyaanisquatsi as the best movie ever made, this is the worst. It is also a "pure" movie, but this is the negative way, exactly what * should * not be done.
