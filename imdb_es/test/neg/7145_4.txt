There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing you have not thought of before, nothing you have not heard before. The story of a gay man who was brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of the people can be approached in many ways, and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and muddy. One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it is neither a movie nor a documentary. The director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and has made the actors interpret them as if it were a movie. The result is weird. And finally, I read in previous comments that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure these comments come from people who consider themselves to be tolerant but can not tolerate other people not liking this movie. This is a fun world.
