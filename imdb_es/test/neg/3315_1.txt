I have never voted 1 for a movie in the IMDB before, but for this I regret that the scale does not go down to -10. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I saw in a preview, and it was my worst cinematic experience. I do not care about stupid jokes. I can live with the silly story. But when I see those "main characters" who smile with their pseudo-foreign discourse (only the Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt a kind of aversion that I never thought I was capable of doing. (If they had been left out, the thing could have been acceptable ...). <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about this. You can laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but that does not improve it. It's definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and rejoice that this horrible job will probably never reach your cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you do it Live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
