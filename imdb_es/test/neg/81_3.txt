Okay, I was never going to change the world, and it bombed at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies that I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it several times during the 80s and I happened to have a High quality VHS tape on the machine (lucky, that!) and we saw it without stopping.I saw the DVD last night and, unfortunately, the time has not been kind to this great blockbuster. This kind of broad and silly humor, come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughter that he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with "funny" slogans, what can you say about the cast or the script? <br /> <br / > Certainly, it is ambitious, interesting, unusual and extensive, but it is never funny, I would describe it as a film for children with some "adult" hints: you can let your children see this safely, despite the 15 certificate. they will get references to drugs, so do not worry about that. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that I had forgotten how catchy the title song was as well as the song "Everybody's Going Faster, Faster" by the song's conductor, not to mention the patriotic anthem of the city of Ticlaw. The whole cast offers excellent performances, the photography is sharp and captures the mood of the different places perfectly, and there is a real-time capsule sensation about fashions, cars, gadgets (especially the mounted drum machine) on the dashboard), the interiors and references of pop culture. I was more than a little surprised to hear the fools of the bank calling out to everyone "I am OJ Simpson!", Particularly now that Simpson's legal knots have overshadowed his sporting achievements. The problem is that there is almost no plot to talk about, it is too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to provoke a lot of genuine laughter. I wish I had left this as a pleasant memory.
