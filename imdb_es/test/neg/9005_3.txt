"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not very good movie, redeemable only for the topless takes of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan telephoned on his behalf and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish cop, but I could not look away from the beautiful Mrs. Russo. There is a good scene of lovemaking on a staircase, a terribly sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack. Oh, and there's a picture stolen from a museum and a catamaran sinks. <br /> <br /> But let's hope that other directors recognize Ms. Russo's happy attributes and assign her to more visible roles.
