This is my first review on IMDb.com and, probably, the first written review of a movie I made on my own, not for a class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie ... it's not a good thing! I am not an experienced journalist or critic (although I have seen my fair share of movies), but I found it very painful to watch this particular movie, it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. Where better to do it than IMDb? When I forced myself to sit through the film, physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots, I was sure there would be some "light at the end of the tunnel", a revelation to explain what is in the samhe. was going on. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as the dog ****. After several rebounds to review certain scenes I still could not conclude anything sensible. I found myself wanting to shout "Does this make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not wasting time, but if it were you, I would probably want to experience it myself. If that is the case, bring a crossword or something so that you do not get bored.
