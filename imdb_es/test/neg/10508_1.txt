DO NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. It's probably the worst movie I've seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. On occasion, we debated if it was so bad on purpose but we are pretty sure it is not. The characters appear out of nowhere as if they had already been established, the scenario constantly changes scene to this store, and Vampire Assassin ends up having about 6 climatic fights with enemies before finally reaching the head vampire. You can also enjoy the unique face of Vampire Assassin, as it never changes its expression despite its obvious attempts. So, if you want to see a movie that makes you laugh hysterically, I suggest this whenever you enter with an open mind. Do not expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it will be even worse than that. Seriously, I want to buy this movie and place it on top of my selection of comedy movies. Right next to Anchorman.
