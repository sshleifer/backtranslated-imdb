This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film that I have had the misfortune to see. I would like to know why someone on earth could enjoy seeing this. I'm so surprised that a name as big as Jon Voight agrees to act on this shameful piece of trash. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be deceived into believing that this movie was correct and the idea of ​​that really bothers me. I think the creators have a lot to answer. The worst thing is that, I think nobody could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film, since they can investigate the Bible in search of the truth, so I think the creators deliberately twisted what the Bible says, and that's something that nobody has the right to do it and I find it very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about it.
