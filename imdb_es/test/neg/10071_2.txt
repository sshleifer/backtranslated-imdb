Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? It's not worth a moment. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies ... and they are not dinosaurs! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she came to the conclusion. I wonder if she accidentally forced a vocal chord while filming the movie ... Laura Dern ... it's okay, but why not be more notorious in the movie? Maybe I'll exchange intelligent dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola: "Have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Feelings, emotions ..." ... you have to try harder on that! Sam Neil, it's not a big deal. The soundtrack ... you have to change that record, or you get tired of that. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor that I've never seen play a bad role ... unfortunately, can not save the film, nor dinosaurs well created by computer.
