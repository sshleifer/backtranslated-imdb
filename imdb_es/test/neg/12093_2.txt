I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis, and actually I had high hopes to see this last night on DVD. Mainly when I try to avoid revisions until I see something by myself and form my own opinion. Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment, which is actually quite decent and if they had made the film about the characters in section 1 alone, it could have increased above the 5/10 mark. Once he entered the "reality TV show" Territory stunk of high heaven. Ryan Reynolds beautifully captured the essence of an actor on the edge, but as a gay television writer and famous game creator / devotee family man, he was definitely less effective. From the propaganda of the box, I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of 'Memento'; unfortunately, this does not come close to the standard of the movie.
