Nobody can say that they did not warn me since I read the reviews (both user and external), but as most of us are attracted to horror movies ... curiosity took this cat. (Come on, we all shout at the people in the movie not to go to the dark room, but they know that horror fans always die to know what's there, even if we know it will be bad). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because he pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed), or because actors and dialogue are so boring (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being educated here). What really angered me is that the movie is not just a BWP scam, but also a half lazy scam. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could overcome BWP and then congratulate them, but they did not even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in the horror movie (or any movie).
