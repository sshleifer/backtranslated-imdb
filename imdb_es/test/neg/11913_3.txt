It's true that I'm not a fan of Monogram Chan movies. . The plot, which involves the theft of radio from a bank vault, is a little exaggerated and is far from the atmospheric mysteries that Fox produced. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (like number 3, Son Tommy) offer some laughs as always. But otherwise there is not much here. Great title that is wasted.
