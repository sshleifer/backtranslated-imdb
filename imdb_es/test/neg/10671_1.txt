I have to raise my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!) To see this movie. Where I start, it's a complete disaster. The main attraction, of course, was the soundtrack. What goes without saying is brilliant: it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, do not give up your daily work: HR should not do it. <br /> <br /> HR's performance is simple and simply horrible. Even if the movie had an argument, what baffles you most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell he's doing there. Two words of advice for RH: give up acting and, secondly, use the chapstick. <br /> <br /> The RH has no presence on the screen, has no acting skills and the female protagonist seems too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat, the same Bollywood vampire shit. <br /> <br /> You can package the product as much as you want, but if there is no substance, it will not be maintained. Do not waste your money ...
