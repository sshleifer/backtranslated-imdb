Of course, HOTD 2 is better than the Uwe Boll party that was the first, but that's like saying that drowning is better than being cut alive. OK, I'm being a little hard on this, it's just that the adaptations of Zombie movies to video games always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but its aftermath is pure crap. The first HOTD was to entertain the shit more than anything else; Uwe Boll took care of that. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The value of the entertainment was there, the hot girls were there, the blood was there, but ... is that all? The script, although mediocre, was better than the first. But in the script are horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés and an end that continues over and over again until reaching a level of ridicule that would make the Bollmeister very, very proud. But, it could have been worse, right? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as an insane doctor in search of a cure for death. As you can imagine, everything goes wrong. A nearby university campus seems to be the center of the Zombie epidemic (or Hypersapien?), And as can be expected, a group of Commands and two Zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. His principal object? No, it is not exploding. Instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure for the deadly virus. Between this and the other, there are the soft interactions of the characters, an insufflatable amount of clichés (but well, at least the black man is not the first to be killed), and decent-looking Zombies. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable. Who would have thought that Sticky Fingaz was a passable actor? I do not. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine a little as leaders. And the cast of support was also passable. Everything was passable. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects on the Zombies were fine, it could have been worse as in the first HOTD: only guys running in dusty mummy suits. The blood was good too. Cheap scars and even cheaper strains are almost non-existent in this movie, which is good. The action sequences were as stupid as f * ck, but at least there were no zombies who fought with swords or that ridiculous bullet effect in slow motion. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will only attract zombie enthusiasts, fans of arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. Apparently there is going to be a third as the end suggests, but it would not count on that. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4.
