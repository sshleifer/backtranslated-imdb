I totally agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who later went to the theater director and said "That was possibly the worst movie I've seen". I have seen MANY movies with this person, and he is quite lenient, so I was really surprised. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was very offended by the humor of the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and we watched the movie with a mainly black audience. For a while I thought, maybe I just do not have this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that nobody was laughing. The writing was bad; the address was bad; the moment was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments, there was too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was more fun than that, and that's saying a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (as Huggy Bear) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was quite small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments like "the white boy", but most of the other humorous attempts did not reach the mark. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not give this movie a negative star rating. .
