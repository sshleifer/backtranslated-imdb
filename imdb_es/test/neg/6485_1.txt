I bought this 'movie' at a gas station in the container of 3.99 for a reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. He is terribly creepy and good, but that's where he stops. The film itself is a very cheap, horribly awful attempt at Western horror, and achieves none, no matter a successful merger of the two genres. Besides Drago, the acting is so bad that I wanted to put the cushions of the sofa over my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the script, I do not even know where to start. You are a Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
