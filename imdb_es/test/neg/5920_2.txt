I thought that this movie was horrible. I understand that it was filmed with a small budget, but the performance was terrible and the movie itself was stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unfriendly imbecile. In fact, all the characters were unfriendly and none was fully developed. The public does not relate to anyone in the movie. It was supposed to be suspense, but if you do not care about the characters, it's hard to "get into" the movie. I felt like a stranger forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story. All the twists of the plot at the end were too much: I was actually laughing when I guess I should be "in shock". In general, I thought it was really a bad movie.
