Actually, I reviewed the whole set of comments, looking for those who gave this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. What is completely disconcerting! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and it's not directed by Christopher Nolan, but by God. This is a direct nonsense to the bargain. They should have finished with this and encouraged the damn thing. <br /> <br /> And what's even worse is that IMDb does not let me just finish my tirade there, because my criticism must be longer! <br /> <br /> The "Awesome" camera shots in the game LITERALLY taken from Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story progresses as a school kid, the multifaceted character and the plot development paralyze already a weak configuration, and the grand finale is boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it was really the best movie I've seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic looking costumes, ensembles and sports equipment. There I said it.
