If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor", he resurrects his character, like Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". This is a very weak "Padrino" satire with little laughs. Stuart Whitman seems perplexed as to what he is doing in this costume festival. The performance of Morgan Fairchild is one of the best efforts in the film, and that alone is not a good sign. Eddie Deezen hesitates between the slapstick "Three Stooges" and a bad impersonation of Woody Allen. Fatally defective, "Mob Boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly surpasses comedy and the film continues with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and many other nonsense. - MERK
