If there's a word I can associate with this movie, it's "shame." It must be embarrassing for all the people related to the film, to see it in a theater. Everything: the script, the script, the dialogues, the lyrics of the songs, the direction, bad quality. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was a child. I liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It is a genre not so explored in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry to make the film. I can not understand the reason behind choosing foreigners as Hindi-speaking characters, who can not even make the correct synchronization (nothing to say about dubbing). The script is terrible. The edition even more. If you follow closely the dialogues, you can detect grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely alter the intended meaning). Music has nothing special about it. <br /> <br /> The greatest shame should be for the board of censors. There are a couple of nip-slip scenes in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can not even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censorship board missed him too. So much for the screen slogan of non-indecent-exposure. Officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not think why Amitabh was with the role. It may be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But paper barely has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not have followed up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy. But otherwise, they are embarrassingly amazing (for example, the capture of arrows ... could probably have been better with CGI, but it was '91 ...). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam do not exactly fit The burning screen. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain (letting the laughter of the villains escape from time to time). <br /> <br /> In general, an interesting concept. It could have been much more better.
