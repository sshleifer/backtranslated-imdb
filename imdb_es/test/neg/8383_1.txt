This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as I had when I finished watching this movie: "Uff, it's okay, it's over, what a relief!" I felt pain when seeing this movie, how bad it was! It's a low-cost film from the B series, that's for sure, but I think it's not an excuse to be so bad! I have seen brilliant low-cost films, with beautiful patterns, good production, good acting and, above all, some substance! This does not have any of that! The plot is hilarious, it almost seems like an "American guide on how to transform the ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous film for teenagers, with some children playing with the occult." I do not know if the Chinese story present in this film is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is simply horrible, a smooth zero (What are "special effects"?). There is no suspense. The alleged "scenes of tension" are a complete failure. The acting is not better; And what about the dialogues? Oh my God! A film that has several times dialogues like: "I'll pass there later, is it okay? Is it okay? It's okay, it's okay." Ok, okay, bye "I'm sure it deserves no more than a score of 1 / 10! <br /> <br /> What a pity to be true!
