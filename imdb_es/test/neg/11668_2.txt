I saw for the first time the three crazy movies max. In succession for the first time a few days ago and I was very disappointed with the third installment. Destroy the excellent work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a plot that turns the Australian apocalyptic deserts into a comic sand pit that one would expect to see in an adventure film for children. Max's character is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical personality that was seen in previous films and became an unattractive and predictable savior that made me feel betrayed. If you have not seen this movie yet, then just do not. Let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself an hour and a half very painful. (spoiler alert) The other big problem I had with this movie that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. We had already seen him in the warrior on the road where he had helped the most, and yet, when he reappears in the thunder, it seems that the two had never met. If he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors, I do not know who the man is. however, it was not explained and is a weak element in this weak film in general. 2 out of 10. Do not receive a 1/10 due to the thunder fight.
