Okay, here's a very brief review: this movie went wrong. I wish I could just have a review that established this simple principle, but I must bore you with more bad review type words like 'horrible' 'clich√©' and 'you can not see'. It's the kind of movie you see when you're drunk or you're stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here's the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group in a hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Truly, really terrible, but once again, I did not pay to see it the first time and only my father felt the absence of circumference in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he is a Republican and all that, but, again, it saved me the horror of paying for this piece of junk. Okay, now it's enough space to be recognized as a revision, so I say goodbye.
