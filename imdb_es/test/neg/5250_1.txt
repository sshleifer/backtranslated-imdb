LOL! First of all, if you have never seen a "Dimension Film", you will be in a real pleasure! Known mainly for the Horror / Slasher films of SUPER LOW BUDGET, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more ultra cheesy style. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. <br /> <br /> Consider the anachronisms! (something out of place and time) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords ... <br /> <br /> However, we saw: telescopes, shoes with soles, cigarette lighters, speakers , Electricity, Body Bags, aluminum cans, and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something that happens like in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It is very laughable. It's really a comedy made to look like a horror movie! I could not stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - he really must have fallen in his career if he is working for "Dimension Films". <br /> <br /> I have learned my lesson though. I will be watching the movie studios in the videos, MUCH more closely now. <br /> <br /> NO REEL OF FIVE WAS QUALIFIED. However, if you want to laugh a lot, it's hard to miss this piece of work! <br /> <br /> This movement had some necklines at some points, I especially liked the blond bimbette! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
