How can things like this be done? Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office, etc., did not kill this old and nasty shit? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Michael Rappaport and I've enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (Copland, Friends) but in this he sucks but anyone would fight with this script. <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys it. But she is Brazilian. And if you have ever seen a typical Brazilian sitcom com, you would understand why I would think this so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to show how predictable the program is and to prove a point with it, I guessed what. The next 3 or 4 development plots / lines would be while watching it for a while and it was almost word for word correct! I felt very satisfied. This annoyed my wife, since she hates it when I do that (I can understand why, but I felt good, so yes!)
