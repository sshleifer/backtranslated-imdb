I'm sorry, but I do not even agree in part with some comments on this horrible article ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language, because I'm a German citizen, so do not blame me for structures inappropriate grammatical or something like that * gg I can not understand why this movie got such a high rating. 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This movie does not make any sense, it does not even seem like a good performance ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments in The Da Vinci Code, which has, I think, almost the same rating, I had to bang my head against the table, because I saw 00 Schneider directly after Sakrileg and, oh my God, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> Most of the posters on this board break up every publicized movie. At the same time qualifies this crime of making movies with a 6.3 and calls Helge as a genius. Of course, he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of his opinions is the fact that German is not his native language and you simply ignore it, or rather you do not realize the pile of garbage that is said in the prayers. Okay, I must confess that some scenes ARE fun, but in general, 6.3 is too much for my compatriot;)
