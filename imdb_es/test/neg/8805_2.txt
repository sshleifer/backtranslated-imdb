I'm usually a glutton for poor movies, but this sucked. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor, what the hell was the point of making this movie? There is no gore to talk about and no action to talk about. <br /> <br /> I could only manage 45 minutes of the fall of a movie, and that's weird for me. <br /> <br /> Something Positive to say about this nonsense? The cover was fine, I'm pretty sure the movie also has an ending, although I did not make it. <br /> <br /> The rats were not organized and exploded constantly, lacked intensity and seemed to be fair to be passing the steps for their salary. The actors were worse.
