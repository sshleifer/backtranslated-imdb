Miles O'keefe plays Ator, a hero dressed in spine who looks like a Chippendale dancer. The Conan-wannabe must fight with an evil guy with a Cher wig and protect the Earth from the Geometric Core, a kind of primitive atomic bomb. Pay special attention to visible sunglasses and tire tracks. Mystery Science Theater 3000 made fun of it under the title CAVE DWELLERS.
