This French film is supposed to be about a creepy, stupid cop investigating the rape and murder of a little girl in a small town. However, the film really does not deal with anything and it takes forever to say anything. If a character takes ten minutes to walk from point A to point B, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes, which makes the viewer wonder if he accidentally pressed the pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The movie lasts about seven hours. You do the math. The actors apparently were amateurs and it shows. Note for yourself: never see a Dumont movie again.
