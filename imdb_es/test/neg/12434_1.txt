Larry Clark is not famous for his talent as a writer or director, but he has made some films of indisputable importance. Children, stalkers and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park achieve their purpose: shock, repulsion and even disgust. These films are intransigent in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Children expose us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. And sexual promiscuity among young people. Bully touched similar topics. Ken Park was faced in part with sexual abuse and suburban boredom. Unquestionably, all these films exhibited something terrible and left a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skaters from south-central Los Angeles who go arbitrarily to Beverly Hills. rollerblading. That is all. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially non-existent narrative. And, like Kids, has a cast of first-time actors who were removed from the stage of the film. However, unlike the Children, none of them has an appearance of talent. There is better acting in porn. This film presents, without a doubt, the most terrible performances I've seen in a movie. One can respect Larry Clark for exposing these young people to the filmmaking process, but these children are absolutely worthy of applause, folks. I should add that apparently these men also produced the soundtrack, which presents some of the most ineptly inept garage punks I've ever heard. My advice is to take a couple of migraine pills before entering the theater, or regret it. after. <br /> <br /> But, again, it's not like they have a lot of script to work with. Each line that is pronounced is devised, pathetic and irritating beyond measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts quite reasonably, but soon slips unexpectedly in absolute absurdity. This begins, of course, with a sexy sexcapade with a couple of rich white girls, followed by a series of cliches from National Lampoonish, which kill the characters for no reason and ultimately result in a ridiculous anti-climax. The vaccines last much longer than necessary. Prepare to watch people fall from skateboards for about fifteen minutes in a row, prolonged and prolonged takes of characters who do nothing or skate in the streets. But again, with the script in just 32 pages, they need as much useless padding as possible. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could continue like this. This is the worst movie that Larry Clark has done so far. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for its shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the purest film he has done so far, and it is also the worst. It is completely horrible. Like, Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst I saw at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
