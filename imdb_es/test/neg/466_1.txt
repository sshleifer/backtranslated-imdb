I had high hopes of seeing this, since I always enjoy the performances of Paul Bettany. I thought he was very good like Darwin, and he did everything possible considering the terrible material he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was one of the most innovative, controversial and innovative. Publications never, but you would never think about it based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a telenovela in a Victorian environment. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year journey in The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, it surely has a supreme meaning to history, since it was from his research on wildlife that he began to form his theory of evolution. This is just a long and dismal domestic drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly crazy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and receiving the cold shoulder of his emotionally constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is nothing short of horrible and has little relation to the historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, either by Emma or the local priest, played by Jeremy Northam (a role that can not be lost and is a complete waste). of a talented actor) to act as a counterweight to Darwin's views, but it was not addressed. <br /> <br /> The story focused too much on the endless Mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie, and he also missed a lot of time in Darwin wondering whether he would write his book or not. Eventually I was so bored that it was hard to worry. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him fighting with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.
