people, get a clue! I mean, writers do not have one, so I hope that ... this show is a pale imitation of the 60s show that can laugh at it! And the show of the sixties is the one with the cheapest special effects, and it's in B & W fer Chrissakes! However, the mood and writing in the old program is THOUSANDS before this nonsense. Get HiP children! If 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to look at it, you would! You know it! Skip them and tell all your friends that you were 'ON' with the 'scene' BEFORE it got too cool!
