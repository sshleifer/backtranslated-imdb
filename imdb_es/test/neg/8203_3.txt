A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of an H-bomb explosion that ends up in the near world. They fear not only the radiation, but also the mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the groups is already contaminated, but strangely it does not pose a real threat to others. Just surviving the friction of varied personalities at close range is the secondary plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is near the edge playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to begin to populate a happy world. None of the best of director Roger Corman. This is predictable black and white sci-fi.
