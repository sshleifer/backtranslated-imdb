This is a really bad movie. That may seem like an oversimplification. A capricious and childlike response comparable to an insult without foundation. The truth is that I can not say enough about the confusing plot without meaning, the really atrocious performance (I'm talking about unpleasant people) or the random images of violence towards women that make up the chaotic pastiche of the radically horrible cinema to make mistakes that drive this affront to everything that is good and decent in the world of cinema, that is, human culture. Please, take my word, do not look at it ... never. I'm serious. Having. You will thank me later.
