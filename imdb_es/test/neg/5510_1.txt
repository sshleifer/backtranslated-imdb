Really horrible Obviously, an attempt to take advantage of the Star Wars craze, but there is no excuse for this insipid piece of junk. The plot is lost before half, the characters are forgettable and the child does not have so much talent that all he does is pose for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually the naval corrals of Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me physically sick to see it. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman has done some good, some bad movies in his career, but there is no excuse for this. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not allow you to enter a zero.
