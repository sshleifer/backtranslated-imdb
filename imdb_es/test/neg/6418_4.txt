This peculiar and visible film is the story of a cheated dentist who begins his mission or crusade to fight caries on his back and beyond Patagonia. Coming from Northern Ireland, through New Jersey, the main character, Fergus, sees his crusade as a mission of great importance and addresses it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. What adds to the hilarity, since their grand plans disintegrate and gradually fall apart as the disaster progresses to the debacle in the Patagonian interior on the back of a custom motorcycle or its, er, mobile dental unit. We never got to know his wife, or the rich philanthropist who sponsors the nefarious mission, but we get a solid sample of Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his performance as credible as the cheated dentist who is gallantly worshiped by the innocent but sexy 18-year-old female protagonist who accompanies the * ahem * ride. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not pushed by the costumes. It is a low-budget film, sometimes charming, always disarming, slightly fun and instantly forgettable that starts with low expectations and almost succeeds.
