I really wanted to see this movie, and it contains very interesting perspectives of Iraqis from all over the country, not just in the main areas. <br /> <br /> However, as the movie went on, and as it seemed increasingly unilateral, I began to wonder who had edited the film. To reduce the hundreds of hours to only 80 minutes, obviously decisions had to be made. <br /> <br /> I would have really enjoyed a movie that showed how the Iraqis felt in all aspects of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people said, and like everyone in the movie They had the same opinion at the end, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a preconceived bias. <br /> <br /> It could have been a great movie.
