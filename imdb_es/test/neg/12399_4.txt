It is strange what fate does to some people. While searching in a discount container at a DVD store, I found a copy of Deadly Instincts. Being a collector of any movie that is science fiction, horror or alien monsters, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it costs five dollars a bargain, believe me). After seeing it, I came to the opinion that it was nothing special. But after researching a bit on the Internet, I discovered that the movie was actually called Breeders and it was a new version of Tim Kincaid's horror movie that threatened video stores in the mid-eighties. That I have already seen. My appreciation of the "deadly instincts" grew after that discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteor crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen, that's right, the guy who becomes a cyborg in the cult film CYBORG COP four years earlier), realizes that some of the students are starting to disappear while find a black Redhead woman with a scar on her face and a curly leather outfit. His research reveals that an alien creature had hooked on a meteorite and had come to Earth to reproduce using local women. Along with a local detective who believes he is responsible for the disappearances, Ashley tries to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The original BREEDERS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who would leave the genre to do gay porn), was a science fiction / horror movie that was actually a soft-core porn movie with a thin veil, designed to take skin movies to fans of the genre. It is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies made in the eighties. Why someone would want to redo it is a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually a better effort than your low budget source. The film, which takes the basic concept of an alien monster that tries to cross paths with human women, eliminates any pornographic element. In fact, the film is actually very docile. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower scene), oaths and violence are kept at a minimum level and there is no gore (which can deceive the gorehounds). This makes the new version a safe movie for the whole family, that is, if the children are not afraid of the alien monsters (which leads me to the M 15+ rating of the film, which seems a bit too much). <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the tenderness of the subject, the film has some flaws. The script, although it presents some good characterizations, has a series of holes so big that a meteor can cross. <br /> <br /> What? Are you angry with me for that? Come on, this review needed a bad word game, so it will still be interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the configuration of the movie is a problem that the script could not solve. The movie is set in Boston, but the buildings do not seem to belong to Boston. Something about architecture is not right. Another thing is the university, with a fairly large building that houses about twenty students (all women, of course) and that only has one class. art. The only teacher there has a relationship with a student (and also the janitor!), Which somehow escapes the attention of the director. Not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real Boston police would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. Oh, and the meteor? Well, the possibility that a meteor sent from Saturn (check initial credits) to reach Earth without propulsion on board is astronomical. That does not include the chances that no passenger in the meteor survives the landing. <br /> <br /> In regards to acting, Todd Jensen gives a reliable performance as the heroic teacher, while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was killed by her boyfriend shortly before the movie came out. striking figure in that leather outfit and proving that she can act.Visual effects are commonplace, and the credits are due to the filmmakers for bringing us an attractive looking monster.
