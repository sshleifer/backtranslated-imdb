I will not spoil it for you. Although you probably do not care if it goes bad (you'll know what I mean after seeing it) Bad story. Rated movie quality B Typical horror - stupid situations - rare moment. I should have known, when they try to make a big hype in their advertising or even add "dating". It just tells me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to attract everyone so that they can reach the cost of making this pump. I would like to be able to recover the time I spent watching this. I was stupid and I thought there had to be something big around the corner. But I kept disappointing myself. I do not usually waste my time adding comments to any movie. In fact, this is my second post. I just felt that maybe I could prevent some of you from wasting money on something that had a big hype.
