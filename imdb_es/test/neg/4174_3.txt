The idea of ​​the movie was not so bad: a horror movie filmed in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad thing was the camera's poor quality work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the hour and a half of walking that this guy took in the labyrinth. Oh, I'm sorry, the "corn." I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a good idea for a movie. But taking everything into account, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much farther with it. Bill Cowell's performance was not so bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his castmates did not help his efforts. Here is to hope that your next movie will be easier to swallow.
