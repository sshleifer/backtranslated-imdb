The sound recorder of River Queen should have been fired, on this day and at this time there is no excuse for a bad recording on the set. Murmuring voices was the final result, and cinematography was, at best, normal. The story had potential and I feel sorry for the foreign actors who must have known they were filming a turkey while they were filming. It is obvious that the movie was suffering from the economic budget syndrome, and the scene in which Temuera is procreating inside the house while fighting a battle outside is too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed some shortcuts taken from the side of the Maori protocol of things, but this was probably due to time constraints of the movie's duration, etc. In general, I was not impressed by this film, the Whanganui River has many beautiful places, but this film gives us a cold, monotonous and claustrophobic image, with nothing of beauty. The film needed more sunlight and better camera angles, less confusion on the screen, better sound recording and more thought necessary to put on what the viewers of the film would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to all involved, however, for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a movie, unfortunately I did not enjoy this one.
