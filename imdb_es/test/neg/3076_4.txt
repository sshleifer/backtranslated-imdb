What is a little interesting hodge-podge. It could have been something else, but it does not seem that the imagination has entered the script or the direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and his lover. The conspirators do a very thorough job to make him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "unimaginative", manages to escape from prison, go to the beach house of the conspirator and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then, accidentally, he drops the recorder with all the evidence in the seawater, but manages to retrieve it. It shows a lot of creativity and improvisation for a man without imagination, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The tape is now damaged, but it is enough to knock down the wife's lover and he sobs. confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The shot in the place is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a raised wooden exterior on the grounds of the Fort Fisher battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after production ended. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately, it's a little difficult to see because someone seems to have filmed each scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. Everything is very blurry. And despite all the natural splendor of the location, the viewer never has a real sense of place, of how the sand feels, of the texture of the gray bark on the evergreens. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine but the artists do not have much to work with. The best performance, as is usually the case, is offered by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not unfriendly defense attorney. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with each beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within his range as an immoral weakling. <br /> <br /> The musical score perfectly combines the sinister with the mysterious and is effective. If you wish to listen to the original, from which it was copied, rent the "Vertigo" by Hitchcock and listen to the theme of Bernard Hermann's suspense. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any particular reason to capture this, except total boredom.
