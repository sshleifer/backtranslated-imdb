First, I wanted to point a medium and large finger at the Troma DVD distribution team, which were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of the killer of this movie on the back of the cover! The synopsis randomly mentions who is responsible for the massacre on the day of graduation, for God's sake! I do not care how terrible or predictable an 80s matador might be; Just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! So, a tip in case you also buy the double feature of Troma containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", right? I repeat NO? Turn the box and read the back! Watching the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the real movie, right? Oh boy! Personally, I am a fan of Herb Freed's cinematographic 'work'. Well, actually, I do not know if I should admire or pity him. All of Herb's films are pretty bad and amateur, but at the same time you can say that his direction is animated and full of good intentions. Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil," he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to capitalize on the typical high school slasher movies. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims on "Graduation Day" are athletes and promising members of the same track as coach George Michaels (amazing name! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dies dramatically on the field, moments after winning a 30-second race. The debate about whether the coach and the members of his athletic team were not pushing their physical limits too high rises, but a particular individual goes one step further and begins to kill all those responsible for Laura's death. What a crazy little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent that I've seen, with a lot of false clues and subplots that do not go anywhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There is a guy impaled by a soccer ball attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly large sword and the most miserable of them, they all even fall to their deaths in a bed disguised as spikes! Herb concentrates on the ingenuity and rapid pace of the murders so much that he completely forgets the secondary plots he introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and apparently begins an investigation into the circumstances of her death. In the middle of the movie, however, his character is almost no longer in the film. In addition, the stepfather of the girls is known as a violent drunk, but this interesting fact is also ignored immediately. Instead of carefully mounted suspensions and deceptive false tracks, disc dance and roller skating sequences are useful. of course ?? Numerous images of unattractive 80s chicks stripping off their covers. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" could count on a respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") largely stars that the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a stranger calls", "The accused") appears briefly as a police detective investigating the growing number of missing adolescents. and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very fun part as the stressed school manager. Teenage beauties in service include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Hell, for some fans of horror, the presence of these two ladies is reason enough to tell the "Graduation Day" among the most important par excellence of the 80's. It's a silly movie, but entertainment and giggles are guaranteed!
