Hello! I am Sheena, a tribal princess from the African jungle (and still white!) Who possesses the incredible ability to transform into the cheapest and most unsuspecting monster in the world (think of the Star Trek 60s aliens), rolling seductively in the mud! When I first met in this horrible position, I took the only logical action: I made a torn jungle bikini in which to perform my mischievous antics. I like romantic novels and destroy the mighty African warlords. And I would be remiss if I did not mention my partner (white, of course), Mr. Cutter, a former US military man who seems to have fled the United States after his divorce. Can you say "alimony"? Anyway, he provides the occasional distraction of my difficult life. I mean, how many blond idiots do you know who are also an endangered species of heartbreaking monster? In spite of my many difficulties (acting is so difficult! * Whining *), I have not given up and, after much searching of my soul, I have finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing insomnostic nocturnal viewers who are so unfortunate . As for not having cable or satellite.
