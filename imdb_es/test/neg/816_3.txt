I'm a fan of Boorman, but this is possibly his least successful movie. Comedy has never been his forte, and here his attempts at farce are clumsy. Still, it's almost worth seeing by Boorman's eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first leading roles, and as always, it's dazzling to watch. (In a side note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a couple of years ago).
