This is not "so bad, it's good". It is "so bad that it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments"! Just by reading the Synopsis you can even imagine the "plot" of this Straight to Video disaster. It is a mixture of grainy file images linked with some of the best performances of all time that you will have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid and humorless mess with "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" is like saying that "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". The cast without talent is disguised in cheap clothes, from J.C. Penney "Goin 'to Church", and there is no attempt at hairstyles or period makeup. If you really want to see how this kind of "homage" can work, see "Cadavra's lost skeleton": it's intelligent, it's well written and, best of all, it's played by real actors who are not so agonizing to watch. For that matter, look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson whose sci-fi short film "The Courage of the 70-foot Courtesy Lady" leaves this film in the dust. The people in Terror In The Tropics look and sound like they're taken off the street and given their scripts to read during the one shot. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and anyone else involved in the movies they cannibalized to make this feast! Money is not the problem: a lot can be achieved with very little expense. A good script, decent actors, and costumes and production design above grade Z should have been taken for granted before the so-called director created this stinky pile of movie spoils. Hopefully the "promise" of a sequel will not come true. This was the most terrifying thing that is shown throughout the movie!
