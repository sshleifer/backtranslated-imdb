Wow. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We have started a tradition. We found a copy of this movie and passed it from person to person. Whoever has the film sees it, and then passes it on to another person who considers himself worthy to see this unique, creative and horrible movie. Let's hope he travels the world a few times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Very painful It is even beyond the bad that it is fun. Well, it's okay, sometimes it's so bad that it's funny. But most of the time you only get the feeling that there is something that sucks your brain from within. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look at it, then pass it on.
