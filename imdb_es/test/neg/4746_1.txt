If I had only read Alex Sander's review here instead of seeing the score of more than 6 from a select selection of the ignorant public, I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a horror / science fiction fantasy, dramatic and well done. Predator was a great science fiction and action disaster. However, I can really only blame myself, since I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It also has an average rating of more than 6 stars from the connoisseurs of the film who frequent this site. <br /> <br /> STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE SOME FEAR OF THIS BOTH SUSPENSE. /> <br /> From the beginning this movie was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship invaded / not invaded by Aliens. Well, maybe they would throw aliens back to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong, but how did this turn out to be an Alien / Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realize it in spite of their great technology? The beginning was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it becomes really ridiculous. I always leave my incredulity strictly suspended over the screen door before entering and pick it up when leaving. I could not here. <br /> <br /> A father and his son are hunting in the forest. The accident of the damaged ship lands at (according to the given view) would calculate at least 10 odd miles through a thick forest. The man and the boy track there alone, find the ship and embrace the face. Even at this point, you feel very little for them, mainly because the assailants are almost comical rather than fearful in their movements and actions, and the father seems an irresponsible and foolish muppet. <br /> <br /> A nervous, suspense scenario is presented with an ex-con who returns to the city near the accident site to be greeted by his friend, a bit bored and now bored police, from the bus. When I say introduction I mean a weak attempt with the actors of the shit and no feeling is played. Then there is a slasher / horror element with a sexy girl and the supposedly nerdy or otherwise undesirable cute guy who is beaten by the overprotective, crazy and nasty Jock guy (American athlete not a Scottish man). Oh, the cute / not cute boy is the brother of the ex-convict, by the way. Yes, these directors are intelligent whose name I will investigate to avoid any other shit they put again. Then, a modern role change, such a boring PC attempt, the introduction of Ripley's credential-type character comes with a female soldier who returns home with her husband and son. <br /> <br /> Guess what will happen next? I will not tell you much more about the real plot (smiles sadly to himself about the disappearance of the narrative in the vast majority of recent films) in case you've gotten this far and not be the brightest star in the Alien universe . . <br /> <br /> The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated in the previous poster, whose post I read too late. The aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is sometimes exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting and meaningless. The hospital scene with pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, it surprised me well. Surprised by how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To awaken the evil? What? If you really want to surprise, excite and scare people who are not pregnant or who expect a father or who have no soul, why not only the Alien / Predator fucks the teenage women and teenagers instead of killing them? The characters have no depth and neither the plot. It is filmed and bad rhythm. It is performed by selfless people, not that I can blame them. It also tarnishes two very interesting and good sets of science fiction characters. This movie was rubbish and if you enjoy it I really have to worry about you. If you have not seen it, well, please, make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS: Did I even mention how trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while civilian amateurs survive?
