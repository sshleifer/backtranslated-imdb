My suggestion ... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", is not it? If not, the producers, directors, actors and "stylists" should choose another career! Now, the guidelines of my presentation require a minimum of "10 lines". How in the world can I add something else to this? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh, yeah, the beginning of the movie was pretty hilarious with the "hard landing" scene. Too bad that the plane did not collide with the tanker and a lot of "Martians" had slipped away from the remains (obviously hidden) and had decided to seize the "world" planet and make a better movie. Now, it would have been a great start! <br /> <br /> T
