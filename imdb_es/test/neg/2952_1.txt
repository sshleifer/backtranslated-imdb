The opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school play. But I have seen high school plays with better performance! Each line was delivered so obviously that I felt I was watching the actors work instead of seeing the characters. I thought that the development of the character was poor and the performance very forced! I discovered that 25 minutes into the film, I did not care what happened because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I kept hanging there, waiting for the movie to be redeemed, but it never happened. Sister Teresa was too sweet, even for a nun, but she seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. In general, I was very disappointed.
