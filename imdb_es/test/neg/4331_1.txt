Blameless waste of my time as a spectator. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Please, do not rent it because you will regret doing it! Guaranteed I wonder how Kathleen Turner ended up in this! She is a legitimate actress and people might be attracted to this movie thanks to her. But it is really better to act as if this title had never been done! It should not have come into existence!
