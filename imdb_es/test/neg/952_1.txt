This program is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 controlled it, taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a program that had as its highlight the thrust of a miniature web server on the back of someone. <Br /> <br /> As the G4 ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, the players, to the young generic men driven by hormones, adding visual appeal to staff and a segment of sexual counseling. Now even the players who applauded the show are initially moving away from disgust. I look forward to the show, and the network, the overwhelmingly backward and well-deserved demise.
