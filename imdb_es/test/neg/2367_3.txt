no exit 2007 was very bad and if it is the way to wrestlemania choose the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and the tough MVP & Minn guys: in my opinion, this was the best match of the night here is a good fight, but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> open cruiserweight championship (won by Chavo Guerrero): horrible, nothing high, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Little Bastard & Finlay def Little Bogeyman & The Bogeyman: this was more comedy than fighting, some laughter. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Kane def king booker: a decent effort for these two, but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> wwe tag team championship Paul London and Brian Kendrick defeat and dominate: another boring game, not very high for the champions. 4/10 <br /> <br /> ecw world title Mr. Kennedy def bobby lashley (discontent): in my opinion, the worst game of the night. truly awful. I thought the ecw was not a rule, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> John dinner & Shawn Michaels, for Batista and the businessman: a good game, but it could have been much better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> in general, this was bulls * that is, give it a 3/10
