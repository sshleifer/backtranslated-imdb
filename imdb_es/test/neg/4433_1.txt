Calling this movie a disaster will be an understatement. I do not even know where to start! Although I have questions, and many of them. I would like to know who conceived this script? Who gave them money to make this movie? Who was in charge of the casting and the costumes? Everyone should be sued! I saw this movie in the catalog of my local library and I thought "Hey! Great!" I had just seen the two FOG movies that Hollywood had produced and then I realized that Bollywood had a version. Without knowing it, it would become a total and absolute shitty party! <br /> <br /> Dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (actually only one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by the 1st Mrs. . from India). World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director do not skimp on expenses to let you know this. The script even states that she (the character's name is Simran) has eyes of Aishwarya Rai, lips of Kareena Kapoor and hair of Rani Mukherjee. Feel free to throw up if you want, at least at this time you have not seen the movie, unlike the poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran receives a death threat one day from one of the participants' uncles, who tells him to withdraw from the contest so that his niece has more chances to win, But Simran's boyfriend does not allow her to do this and, therefore, participates in the contest and wins, this makes the guy who smells like cocaine and his ex-college friend, Tanya, chase her, but with the help of his cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the guilty and enlists his boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body.It is difficult, but finally they manage to do it. <br /> <br /> In a scene borrowed from the Hollywood movie Diabolique, the The pool where the dead body is hidden drains itself only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins an enigma of Whodunit and Where-is-it? At the moment the film ends, the film steals scenes of "I know what you did "Last summer, I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder she wrote episodes and not to m Ention, Columbo and Scooby Doo '! Shameless, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems within the film include, among others: <br /> <br /> 1. Simran, with little clothing, responds to phone calls three times from his possible killer, the camera shows how the phone picks up, but the phone can ring again each time and answers to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya tries to commit suicide because she does not win the beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times more beautiful, did not attempt suicide when she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. At the pool scene, children who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. The murderer's cliche blue contact lenses change from blue to brown at the drowning scene, but when his body reappears, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one who dies in the film complains (it's strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty dark pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and, miraculously, the pool is transformed into Olympic size and is clean and clear as day. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy belly dancer performs a song soaked in pseudo orgasm and a dance number on coming of age. That would have been great for a bachelor party, but they were celebrating the victory in the Simran contest! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal can not dance or Lip Synch properly. But do not blame them, just accept that there was not a choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing was choreographed inside the film, it was as if they simply told the actors to introduce themselves and do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> 10. The film developed as if there were no script. Either that or the director was drugged and drunk when filming this garbage! <br /> <br /> 11. When the photo of Simran was published without his consent in a magazine, he flew to the police headquarters to arrest the photographers, but receives death threats and never bothers to alert police. <br /> <br /> Just to mention a few of course. This film was a painful experience for me and I advise everyone to omit it by all the necessary and possible means. Bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this type of film.
