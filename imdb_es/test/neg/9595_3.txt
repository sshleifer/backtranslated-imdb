I saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. They had advertised it as a horrible movie, so I was attracted to see it and it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> A group of young people from 18 to 19 years old goes to an excavation site in an old Viking. Castle in Denmark, to try to discover the myth of the Berserker Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the forest and people begin to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story is supposed to take place in Denmark, where it happens to live. There were so many places in the movie where Hollywood style overlapped Danish reality. It really made acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings. It feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the movie. When at some point you hear someone speak "ancient Danish", it sounds exactly like modern Swedish. Really a bad investigation, considering that the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie used GPS and maps, and that's really fun, because Denmark is the size of your backyard. No matter where you are, there is never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to the civilization. And if you are in a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many general views of the forests in the film and, sometimes, we see what appears to be the vegetation of North America (?) The story did not exactly attract me, maybe because the acting was so bad. When the characters see the swamp creatures for the first time, they are not even scared. I guess his acting skills were insufficient to show realistic emotions. In the end, there is an unexpected turn, but it did not impress me, since I really did not care. <br /> <br /> The swamp creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they fail, since we see them arrested in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. Also, there are no really terrifying scenes, since most of the swamp creatures are standing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, conclusion: without taking into account the facts, the movie is your typical B-horror movie. I guess people from other countries can enjoy more. As long as you are not aware of reality, it does not matter. As I think of EE. UU Like a great action movie, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle ... and some living people dead in a swamp ...
