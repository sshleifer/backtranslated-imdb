I saw it on French television today and I was very disappointed! The film starts reasonably well, but nothing is clarified and in the end we are not more advanced than at the beginning. As for seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, this is not plausible. He needs tangible evidence to condemn someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case, there is none, so it is not plausible. Remember the old adage "innocent until proven guilty." The fact that a woman has disappeared without a trace is not proof that her husband killed her. So I really do not know what kind of point this movie was trying to make. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the viewer. Frankly, seeing it is a complete waste of time. After all, a movie must be entertaining ... this is completely false in this case and I suggest that it be sent irrevocably to the rubbish bin where it belongs.
