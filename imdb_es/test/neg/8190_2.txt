I have not seen many movies worse than this one. The plot, the dialogues, the performance: it's horror! The story just jumps from a to b a c without any logical step in between. Every time you think you've missed something, but no: that was the way it was meant to be. And why the devil is the character that Jenny Garth plays so in love with that boy who has not lost (who actually now plays the movie Cinderella Man with Russel Crow)? Oh, well, it's not Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to be published. This movie is really not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic movie of good quality with a lousy story, so if you're ready for that: you'll have a ball.
