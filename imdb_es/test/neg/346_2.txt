I think you can not imagine how these people really work ... !! Before coming to the studios to see the guys working there, I really thought the same as you. But since I saw and did the work that the guys in that TV show have to do, I have to say that they really deserve respect for what they're doing all day. That really is not an easy job. And also the actors, who in your opinion can be terribly bad, are really great people and many of them can really act! I do not think that the material that has been given to them really can show that, since I think that this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I do not think you, before you've seen these guys working there, you can judge them! And I should not have judged for them before I knew them, but I did and now I'm terribly ashamed of it. So, please, do not allow yourself to judge these great people unless you have not seen them doing their job.
