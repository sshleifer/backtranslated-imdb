This may not be the worst movie the best movie has won, but it's up there. Well, on second thought, this is probably the worst movie that has won the best movie. Even so, one would expect it to be worth a movie. That, in fact, if it is questionable too. The movie has almost no depth and is simply "fun" after "fun" if you want to call it that. At the beginning it is very interesting, but it seems that everything is exaggerated on many levels. <br /> <br /> The performance was not spectacular to watch, but it was very interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first leading role. I found many of the characters as the tone of the film annoying after a while. I really liked James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He saved the movie because it gave him a much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, after Stewart there was not much else. <br /> <br /> The address of the highly respected Cecil DeMille did not exist for me. I found the movie cheesy at times and his use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the film was very good at times, but it did not generate that magical feeling that the classics should have. The writing was pretty good considering the shallowness of the film. <br /> <br /> Of movies like this one the term "Hollywood Trash" arose. There is no depth, there is no valid attempt to get emotions out of the audience and there is simply no artistic value for the film. Then, of course, the many holes in the plot along. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. Even through this film, I had the feeling that a lot of what I was seeing was not an incorrect and inaccurate representation of the life of the circus, but the opposite of what it really is. Why this better won image surpasses me, but it's not like the first or last time the Oscars make an error.
