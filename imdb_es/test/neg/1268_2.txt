There are many so-called anti-war / anti-government. The politics of politics now begin as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor kids are going to hell, so let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault' - something like that. I was half afraid that this would be another in that style, even if it was about another topic / aspect of the same subject. I almost did not go to see him; for that matter, I almost did not write this review. What have we got here? An Egyptian is taken to a secret center of torture on the high seas, by order of the United States, but it is another Egyptian who has to do torture, not an American: "look, we Americans have clean hands", and Egyptians are bad. Much anyway, so let them hurt their own. Oh, and the candy had to be an American with a conscience: in fact, many Americans have them, but here the concept was out of place. Yes, we all know that it is called Extraordinary Rendition and it started in the Clinton era and now it is used for reasons that are beyond the control. Otherwise, he was very embarrassed and nervous about actually condemning the United States for being part of the torture; As if the manufacturers were afraid to go all the way for fear of being slandered as unpatriotic or whatever (look at the message board! Anyone who apologizes faces a heavy verbal artillery). Torture is something terrible, whether it is guilty or not; In the 18th century, Frederick II, the king of Prussia, abolished it for convicted murderers, although I must say that a life sentence for a child molester is much less than what I want to see. Okay, what about torture? This movie did not really bring to light its horror and despair enough. When you are under torture, (now capitals come to emphasize, I am not screaming). YOU SAY AMEN TO ANYONE WHO IS ASKING, WILL STOP. IT DOES NOT, BUT IT NEVER LEARNS AND CONTINUES SAYING THAT HE DID IT WHAT THEY SAY HE DID, WHAT YOU DID NOT DO. Another thing that the film did not bring up was that TORTURE IS EXCEPTIONALLY, HUMILIALLY INDEPENDENTLY, AND THAT FEELING TO BE WITH YOU ALL YOUR LIFE. Somehow it changes the people inside. How do I know all that? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Reissue: two things: the Arabic that was used in the film was not the Egyptian dialect. It's something worse than putting a movie in New Zealand with the locals as the characters and they all have American accents. In addition, the terrible little preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion, which should have been revealed. Nor was it explained anywhere that any nincompoop can become a mullah / imam; it does not need any special qualification, and that is a hiatus that must be corrected: many are acceptable due to their fundamentalist views and the great ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, finances many of them. Thank you very much for this space.
