I had heard that this movie was elegant and intriguing, but I found it annoying. It's been a while since I saw him (and I hope he does not discover that all my memories are wrong and I unfairly condemn this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to play Leopold and Loeb as victims of An anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused his horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and I think it is unfair to both homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story. I can not imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs. I also thought that the L & Ls were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they really were, after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by Morrissey. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that involved the anachronisms of the film, like the push button The telephones that used the characters were meant to "add Brechtian distance". They certainly do that, but I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many people found this movie interesting, but would have preferred a less "elegant" and more realistic examination of the homosexuality part. He may have played in the case of Leopold & Loeb.
