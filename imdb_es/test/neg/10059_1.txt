I had never seen so much talent and money to produce something so bad in my entire life! As indicated in other comments, a who's who of talent, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many more were involved in a film that is not recognizable as an Agatha Christie story. I still think about how it could be with the same cast, done the right way. <br /> <br /> The movie has even less intimacy than Christopher Reeves' "Superman" movies. The big cast makes slick production even less effective than in those movies, because there is not enough time to meet anyone. The progressive jazz soundtrack by Dave Brubeck made me wonder if the wrong video was in the case of the rental store. The music became increasingly offensive as the plot progressed. It is difficult to say if the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from previous scenes was more offensive. From someone who has seen most of Christie's films (that's what attracted me to this, it was one of the few I had not seen), I miss this one. It is not an Agatha Christie movie. Golan-Globus is more suited to producing films about wrestling, rather than the cozy atmosphere of the English mystery.
