Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the great films of the 70s. The sequel, "More American Graffiti" is a horrible and depressing disorder of a movie. It was not fun, the friendly and wide-eyed characters had become cynical and boring, and the stories were invented (like the character of "Laurie" who has another brother because Richard Dreyfuss did not make the sequel and "Terry the Toad" and "Pharaoh Joe" somehow managed to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a police officer with the name of "Falfa" (the character of Harrison Ford in the original) who makes a "cameo". He does not even look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to even bother with this crap. <br /> <br /> The keyword here is "funny". This movie is not even fun. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a group of hippies who smoke drugs and try to get her boyfriend out of jail; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the lovebirds in the original, have two children and have become an annoying and argumentative couple; Adorable little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", another hippie girl. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a racing driver of losers whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original, and gave it a great flow, is only heard sporadically. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a sad failure. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and the authentic nostalgia of the original are not in the sequel. It was a film that was not necessary to do and it is better to remember what was a great movie "American Graffiti" and avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
