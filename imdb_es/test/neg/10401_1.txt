Kubrick may have been the best director of all time. He could have made more classics than anyone. He could have been a perfectionist. But man, it was his first terrible attempt! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had a good reason to try to make this movie disappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood movie. It has a strange narrative, cheap shots, a bad dialogue, a sinister music that recalls his 50s science fiction / horror movie, and what appears to be relatives of the cast of "Reefer Madness" going crazy for no reason. <br /> <br /> Sure, you can see an underdeveloped Kubrick there. It is a psychological / terrifying study of war. The characters became dehumanized and went crazy. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting shots out there. But in reality, this is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Of course, I do not discourage you from looking at it. If he succeeds, he will join a select group of myself and a few thousand people around the world who have had access to him.
