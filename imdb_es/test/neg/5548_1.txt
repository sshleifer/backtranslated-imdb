Well, this took my nerves away, they understood it well. The first time I rented this movie was in the 80s, when my friend opened a video store that published every rare movie I could find. He also brought all the films of shock, horror and exploitation that he could unearth, and I went through almost all of them. He had previously seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs, and Gore's Wizard. They were horrifying (especially during the period of time), and Gore's Wizard became quite unpleasant. However, the Gore-Gore Girls was the one I remember as the most disgusting and bloody. <br /> <br /> I rented it on a DVD recently because I wanted to hear the comment and I thought I could have done it. A little dance and great clothes. I forgot that it was made in the early 70s, so the fashion had already gone downhill. I also realized that it was a movie that I really did not need to see more than once. It had fun parts, but gaaaah! It was much more unpleasant than I remembered. I'm very tired of the movie gore, but a couple of times I just got too assaulted and had to look the other way. This was not a good choice of film to put on DVD everything sharp and clean with better sound and image quality. The comment is funny in some parts and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00) Maybe HG Lewis did not feel well that day, but he seemed tired in general and also had the nerve to be offended when the Something interviewer Wild compared him to Ed Wood Jr. Sorry buddy, but you're not exactly Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of dancers to-go go in strip clubs. A nice reporter and a really unattractive private detective come together (somehow, it seems they can not stand it) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. Many really ugly murders happen. <br /> <br /> I'm going to apologize in advance because I do not want to sound like I need to clarify, but this movie was so misogynist that p *** took away more than "Company of Men". Mainly because the displeasure of the main character and the director for the women and the audience simply oozes out of each painting. It's not just the murders. The highly unattractive detective does his best to treat the reporter as if she were a dog at any time, for no apparent reason (not exactly a threat to George Clooney, as I said) and she still follows him like a puppy. She faints when she sees a horribly mutilated body and he looks at her with displeasure, then pours a cold soda from a can into her face to wake her up. Later, he calls the police to report the crime: "No ... there is no rush ... she seems to have ... lost her face". This boy is the hero. You can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I could go on and on, but you understand the idea. Keep in mind that I am making this movie sound much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it really is. <br /> <br /> The majority of the cast is the type of actors to whom they pray that they will never remove their clothes. It is not too easy for the eyes, so do not look at the movie just to see the nudity unless it is not too demanding. All the go-go dancers seem desperately want the scene to end in order to get their $ 10 or the fee that HG paid them and get their dose of drugs. Okay, it's not that bad, there was a dancer who seemed to have been a professional and another great dancer with a great afro who did not look as miserable as the rest, but not so excited. The only slightly entertaining things were a couple of moments of brief, unintentional humor, like when a policeman in charge at a murder scene shouts angrily "Get out of here before all of you are arrested!" not to a group of reporters, but to some other policeman who is doing his job calmly (although they mutter and move away). However, Henny Youngman is a little funny, as Lewis says, he said his lines were so fast that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to finish the day in a hurry to get paid and get away) hence, although he does not seem to care to see some naked girls). <br /> <br /> It may be worth it to see it only out of morbid curiosity. By the time the movie was made, it was probably the most frightening. What happened in the movie at that time, or if you are really a huge fan of HG Lewis and find it fascinating, or a low budget movie made by someone. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and you can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early 70s ... this movie does not even come close, say, "Pink Flamingos" "When it comes to the jumping popcorn factor. If you have never seen a HG Lewis movie, I recommend you try first "Blood Party", you will have a better time. <br /> <br />
