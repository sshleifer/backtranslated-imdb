This is a serious movie about black revolutionaries and it's not really an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's quite stark and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it's not that interesting either, and Billy Dee's character, although abused by white authority figures, is not really that understanding. It is also affected by its extremely low budget. Still, it is interesting to see it as a good representation of the social problems of the seventies.
