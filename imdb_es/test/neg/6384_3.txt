I have seen this movie and honestly I was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was so much they could have done with the movie that they did not because they were so caught up trying to be dark and make some deep comments about life, or try so hard, not A, that the characters and the story got completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture of this director and I have enjoyed it quite well. But I felt that this movie lacked the fantasy and the heart of the other and I kept thinking what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it did not make sense. Honestly, although I did not feel like pulling my hair out during the movie, I regretted the time lost in the sad little movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I did not
