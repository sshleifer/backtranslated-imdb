Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble. Sheba, a private investigator and former police officer, comes to the aid of her father. But someone will stop at nothing to get his father out of business. An attempt to show that his muscles go badly and Sheba's father is shot to death in cold blood. These guys have messed with the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I can do is Pam Grier Lite with some bad acting. For a Pam Grier movie, Sheba Baby is incredibly docile. It is not as violent as some of his previous films. No more exaggerated images of Pam placing a small revolver or razor blades in his afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his team can not take a candle to some of the villains that Pam faced in his previous films. It's strictly numbers and it almost has a television feel. As for the bad performance, the bad guys that Pam faces have such an unnatural sound in their presentation as I've seen. As a result, characters like Pilot are not as threatening as they should or should be to make the movie work. <br /> <br /> That does not mean there are not moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did not enjoy (Pam in a wetsuit and Pam brandishing a spear gun), it's just that, compared to other movies from Pam like Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Friday Foster, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> One final remark: I may be more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I do not remember a moment, even in the 70s, when I could carry a suitcase full of weapons in a plane. When Sheba flies in aid of his father, he has an arsenal in his luggage!
