The ruins are for tourists like Deep Impact for Armageddon, a worse version of a slightly entertaining film, but much worse. One of the characters is supposed to go to medical school, so why are they all backward? "You can not keep cutting". -the best line of this movie This is a horrible movie. I like horror movies, but I fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but I had high hopes in this movie after seeing the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. It's horrible, the only thing that makes it a bit nice is its cool Australian background, even though they spend most of the movie in one place.
