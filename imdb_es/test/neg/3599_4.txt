Ewww! A sequel to disney that is garbage! Who would have thought? Actually, quite judging by the comments here, and they are not wrong. In fact, I expected to see this horrible movie based on my taste for the original. And therein lies the whole "cash-in" mentality of Disney. Take out any old trash on the back of a hit and people will go for it. Do not you think they're so cynical? Ask yourself this, then ... How many Disney movies have sequels? And then ... How many of those sequels generate a follow-up? A significantly smaller number <br /> <br /> The new rhythm of Kronk is just another example of this. The plot is ridiculously simplistic and elongated. Even more annoying was the increase in the number of elements and scenes "out of place", for example, an old man at home and, God forbids an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse still, the opposition leader of Kronk, Chippamunk, has a totally baffling English accent above all for no reason at all. An accent that was, after a very short time, intensifying the nerves. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good things. The animation is very nice and the announcers do well with the poor dialogue they receive, especially with Warburton in the lead role. But apart from this, there really is nothing to recommend it. Of course, young children may like it, but there is little to amuse mom and dad as they sit with this mutual mutilation of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal that you would use to avoid A herd of lions devouring men.
