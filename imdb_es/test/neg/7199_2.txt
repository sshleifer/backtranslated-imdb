This is the first movie I've seen since the Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani, also known as Miles Deem. The previous title was superfluously added later because there is another 1961 film with the same name, starring Richard Basehart, which was the only work of Hammer Films, Michael Carreras, in the Western; the genuine Italian title was originally translated as HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH, BUT THEY WERE CALLED AMEN, although in reality it was WALLACH in the Italian variant which, of course, implies a tribute to the type of actors of the Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> While not undoubtedly bad, examples of clumsiness and ineptitude abound, so he often laughed out loud: a horrible number by a possible irresistible French singer; a totally irrelevant fight at the bar; actors who make deadly leaps when they are shot; an elderly villager doing an improvised dance routine; inefficient use (in fact, abuse) of slow motion; and, easily, the most absurd, to see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunmen (wearing the names of the actors themselves!) hired by the villain to kill the main character and then not make them appear in the rest of the movie. ! <br /> <br /> The main actor, Robert Woods, is even that, even to ineffectively whispering the Amens about the bodies of his victims. Support the actress Simonella Vitelli (actually, the director's own daughter!) Since the villain is very good, but, unfortunately, can not she do much in the movie? Despite having a change of heart toward the end. The main theme is pretty good but, once again, the title song is, in itself, pretty lousy.
