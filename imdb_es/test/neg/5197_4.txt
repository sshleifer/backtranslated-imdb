I feel in conflict with this film: it is one of the most beautiful films I have seen and offers a perceptive vision of a lost culture. There was an early scene of men with hats and mustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving and an accordion, which made me cry, just because of the way she captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many. today. It presents the life of the characters as an inextricable link with the life of the people, another concept lost in today's world. The symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little outdated. The fatal flaws of the film for me were the lack of a convincing dramatic impulse and a total lack of humor. I never felt that I knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things, like mourning the loss of a loved one, etc. The people were stick figures in the director's paintings that involved natural disasters, war, etc. The film was just a beautiful tragic Scene after another, without narrative thread and without humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish seeing him.
