This is possibly one of the worst movies I've had the displeasure to see in my entire life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I saw this movie with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. The character of Ben Kingsley is simply stupid, but nothing funny. It's a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such guts. Tea Leoni makes a good impression of Hillary Clinton all the time to portray the female leader, very cold and uninteresting, who has all the endearing qualities of the handle of a broom. Add a secondary plot with no meaning and no explanation and a montage worthy of a horrible nightmare, and end with a loss of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
