I suggest that in the future, any movie made by the science fiction channel and subsequently released on DVD must say that it was indeed made by that channel, since it would not buy these things if it had known this fact. Not that all this has been bad, but when it has faded for the commercials in the middle of his movie, it simply ruins the flow of that movie. This in turn makes the movie more boring. This had an interesting story, however, the extremely generic and absent-minded soundtrack of the movie as did most of the bad actors, with the exception of Dien and Linda Carter. The story, the vampires are in the attack in South America, of course, the rules of the vampire movies are not in force, which is generally not in any of the vampire movies I've seen lately, with the exception of the Blade trilogy. The group of soldiers is sent to battle, and the team is sent to another team to meet with the team and locate the ex-wife of one of the soldiers ... why she is not only his wife, who knows this part The plot really does not go anywhere. We still have an interesting boat ride, a beautiful jungle landscape and lots of blood. This fact, however, does not prevent the film from being too abrupt in its presentation and it seems really boring at times. I do not know, maybe it was the CGI blood, and the smoke and all that they have to CGI now, although the old effects look better and do not cost much more. I mean that cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet hole without cgi, why can not we now?
