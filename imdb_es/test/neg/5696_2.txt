So it's a space movie. But it is low budget. You ask, "what about the effects?" The effects are sometimes good and, sometimes, really bad. I mean bad And notice that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> Here is a story, but it is told in what I think is the wrong order. I do not mean an incorrect Tarantino style order. I mean, it's said in a completely absurd arrangement. Most of it is about a mother (in the future, because you know, it is science fiction) as told by her daughter, which is mainly an exhibition made in narrative from the perspective of the daughter. Only once you have finished the first hour and heard the voice of Paul Darrow as a computer, will you realize how much more tolerable the constant narration would have been if you had read it. This narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on the screen just say a word during the first hour. <br /> <br /> There is also a lesson here for you, future filmmakers: if you are not doing 2001 and you want to have some action (this one does), then hire a good fight choreographer. Otherwise, your fights will look like, well, what's in BATTLESPACE. And notice that the title has the word "battle" in it. Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think this could be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is to see that the listing of this movie costs $ 1.8 million. When you compare it with something like PRIMER, which worked best with a budget of a few thousand, you realize that in the making of low-budget films, it's all about the story. I did not expect much, but STILL disappointed me. Two out of ten stars.
