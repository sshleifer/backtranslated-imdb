Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a nice ex-convict who just got out of prison and helps the feds to catch a corrupt sheriff in a small town. Critics often accused relaxed Reynolds of simply calling these "good friends" performances; It's true, it's on autopilot in everything. But in his day, Reynolds knew how to make a low-key effort work well for him. Congruent and handsome, Reynolds is about to wink at the audience as best he can, without separating; It seems that he knows these forests, as well as any movie star, while the director Joesph Sargent provides an easy rhythm and a sweaty environment that gives life to the South. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and the supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins act in an exaggerated way (as usual). Diane Ladd is fine in a small part, and the daughter of real life Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background. Reynolds returned to this character for the "Gator" of 1976. * 1/2 of ****
