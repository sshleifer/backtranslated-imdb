Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've ever bothered to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The aliens look like puppets in rubber socks. The effects would have been mediocre in the 70s, but they are simply atrocious by today's standards. Could not you take a picture of an actual train instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> The performance is not excellent but, in reality, the dialogue is the worst part. It breaks through in your mind. "Do not die for me, not now." If you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed by the movie, the aliens, the model train or the clich√© dialogue will quickly and painfully bring you back to reality. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this movie a "1" because it does not deserve to be rated so badly that some poor people do not see it for the pleasure inherent in a really bad movie.
