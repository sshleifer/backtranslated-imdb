It is difficult to find something worthy of praise with this movie. It is not the worst image that has ever been made, but that does not say much. The plot is quite incoherent and incredible; It seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to do it underwater to take advantage of the success of The Abyss. In some scenes it seems as if the story had initially been established in outer space; the submarine has a landing gear, the technicians are worried about a rip in a rubber diving suit in the depth of several kilometers, where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, with the planning of a recovery of a lost submarine. After that, the film dives along with the siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are more or less. The navigation screens are made in Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the submarine is controlled like no other submarine; Instead of control consoles, officers have keyboards with which they enter long numerical sequences to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship is not too convincing either. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from clumsy to absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I do not see the enjoyment factor here. The movie is not good or hilariously bad MST3k style (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a slightly bad apple.
