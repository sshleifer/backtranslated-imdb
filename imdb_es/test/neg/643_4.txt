After watching this movie on television, I looked for it in the IMDB and imagined, to my surprise, a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. Especially bad is the edition; The poor way in which the story jumps from one point to another was amateur and a great distraction. It is not done very fluently. I agree that the performance was quite decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was intriguing enough.
