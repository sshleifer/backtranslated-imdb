It begins looking like it may be going somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters to a three-ring circus of amazing stupidity that permanently destroys any sympathy of the characters. I'm a big collector of stoner movies, but this is something I would not consider a valid addition. Bong Water is garbage from the deeper regions of the garbage container, and I would not be surprised with this on my shelf. In fact, I am convinced that this movie was created by Partnership for A Drug Free America. If you are a Jack Black fan, I would say that you can think that 5 minutes of the movies are good because Jack Black continues with his legacy of singing songs for retards. I really can not say enough about this movie.
