I, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing it from Patton Oswalt. Interestingly, it was easier to find than I thought. However, it should not be surprising that I found it used. <br /> <br /> The plot is summarized in a masterly way within the title. It is a bed that eats. Nothing more and nothing less. There is an effort to launch a story, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The blood of a demon ended up in a bed and, as a result, it becomes possessed. Devour everything that happens over it by absorbing it and then dissolving it in what appears to be an orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but was ill and ends up behind a painting in the room where he lives. The narration is completely told through him. <br /> <br /> This movie fails horribly in everything, even in being bad. Still, it is not without its own brand of charm.
