Woohoo! I just do not know where to start with what made this movie so horrible. Maybe I should start by saying that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was laughing a lot. Yes. The acting really was so bad. Acting was not even the worst part. The plot was almost entirely in the previews. All the characters are very little developed. The dialogue and the "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The bad boy is a caricature of an out of control, drunkard, sadist. <br /> <br /> But hey, the actors are pretty, so I guess that was supposed to improve everything.
