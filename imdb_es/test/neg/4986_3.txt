I did not like Underdog! I mean it was really unnecessary and I needed a big face lift, and then maybe it would have been okay, but I did not like the main part. It was not like any other children's movie. Of those films that wanted the parents (who grew up watching the caricature) to come with children to see this, I'm not one of them, so the movie did not appeal to me in the least. Do not think that Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made him sound careless and really unintelligent. Then it was really predictable what makes you feel tired and angry. The humor was what really made me angry, it was just to vent and something. pathetic. What bothered me most in most thoughts was how almost everything that came out of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The acting was passable but needed a small improvement. If you have children, you may enjoy it, but if you are not a child. Everything means seeing it that you like, unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10
