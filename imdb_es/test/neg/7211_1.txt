"Direct to video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless it is a direct sequel to a video that went directly to the video in the first place. Despite this, the studios have insisted on launching numerous direct sequels to the video over the years for the cult successes. I do not think it's necessary to mention that these sequels are among some of the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It's fitting that ROAD HOUSE 2 was directed by Scott Ziehl. It was also the one in charge of ruining the series Cruel Intentions. Like his entry into the trilogy of Cruel Intentions, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great movie for boys, and rejects them without success. This is not a sequel, this is a new version until the end. Several lines of the original are repeated, the plot points are cut and pasted, and the scenes are replicated almost shot by shot from the first. The only thing that could not be duplicated were the incredible fight scenes, which made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here, we obtain clumsily directed sequences of struggle that are too short or too long and, apparently, planned and taken in an hour. Compare that with the battle scenes of his predecessor that seem to take months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to direct the action as he did well with the new 2001 version of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talents shown there is resolved in this mess. It's not entirely his fault, since the script is very, very badly written and awkward. I do not care if something goes directly to the video, a good script is still required. Someone should have that mind while continuing to produce these low budget movies, direct to DVD. Jump completely. 1/10
