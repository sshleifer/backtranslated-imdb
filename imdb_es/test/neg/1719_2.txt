Stunning and extremely low budget science fiction without any charm and appeal. Even the scenes related to the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. It's just a bad scam of "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be eager to get away from this meaningless and boring sci-fi entry. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 (two). And do not say I'm not a good boy!
