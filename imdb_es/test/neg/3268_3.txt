Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack. But, there are legitimate reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this movie, BUT he did not like the script, he wanted to change it, his request was rejected, so he did not make the film. (2) It was a low budget, Bill Murray had achieved superstar status. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase, the so-called "ace" of the first film (although it was Rodney all the time) could not be in more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him. BUT you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all useful substitutes, that none had their best performances.
