Adventures in Dinosaur City, although a creative idea, was a nauseatingly dreadful attempt to make movies. Being absorbed by a television and by a new world is interesting. Three adolescents obsessively enthralled with half-animated dinosaurs are not. Do not waste time or the mental capacity to see this sure loser. I would not even let my children see it.
