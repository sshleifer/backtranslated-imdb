What is the point of this movie? It starts like a movie, then changes the subject, the resolution of that movie deceives us and ends like another movie that is nothing more than a pale, pale imitation of so many other horror movies that you've seen. The general impression is confusion in all aspects and great arrogance. Tarantino's script, Rodriguez's address, two boys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own enthusiasm and assume that everything they do should be good simply because THEY did it. But it does not work that way. You're only good while you keep doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: What are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing when involved in such a useless dreck? Clooney initially makes a bad boy intriguing? Absolutely implacable and efficient? and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do it. And the movie Clooney of the vampire becomes a completely different character. That's not smart or witty, that's just an evil, a bad job. Keitel looks completely uncomfortable and it's no wonder. Did anyone in the studio take a look at the script before this project was approved? Tarantino is absolutely unpleasant as a deviant sexual murderer (and why he, as a writer, assumed that we would find rape, dreadful murder and the murder of a harmless hostage). On all levels? except the technique? This movie sucks. Avoid.
