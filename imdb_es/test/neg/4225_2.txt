I think the letters were stacked against the webmaster, because from the beginning there was an itching sensation, as if something was wrong but I could not identify it. Then he hit me. Nicknamed For a moment, they handled most of the lines, either as voice-overs or off-screen, with only a small clue here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the type of dubbing that irritates the nerves, with nothing remotely funny. I hate dubbing, but at least, however, poorly placed martial arts movies tend to have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker doing piracy and things like that. . Maybe like the back of the table in the movie Hackers (it's about the person trying to keep them away from people trying to enter). What I got was a poorly written murder mystery, meaningless, sometimes with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutralized without his little ego, and a director who obviously did not know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to get there, grab the boy's camera and shoot myself. The edition was not much better. The acting? Well, I suppose if the leader did not have such a bad script to work with, at least it would be visible. The main bad guy was also fine, but almost everyone else was a joke. The dubbing did not help, but the acting was pretty bad, even with that in mind. <br /> <br /> Before getting into something worse, let's look at some good things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the things of the cyber world, how little there was of that, and I would have much preferred to see a film about everything, in and around that, in the warm surroundings of the real world. The forgery of the thumbprint seemed great, but it ended up being quite useless in the scheme of things. The contraption of the heart, which reminded me of the Cronos by Guillermo Del Toro, was interesting, although as a plot device plucked directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was conceived horribly in the long term. There is a point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is there. Why did not you try the fingerprint of the bad boy (since the heart device was activated with the thumb)? However, some interesting devices and cybernetic things, if only they could have been used better. <br /> <br /> Now, who dares here to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place at some point in the future and there is a kind of unconventional kind of romance in both films. There's a murder investigation, but I've seen a lot of movies with a murder at their center that have nothing to do with Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. That's where the similarities end. Period. There's no comparison, just like there would not be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great capacity for art direction and knows some basic aspects of filmmaking, such as where to place the camera. The webmaster is cheap, and not just for the budget. It's cheap due to bad writing, and because most of the time it takes the easy way out (like writing on a character that barely appeared in the first place to save the girl at the end to take her to Point B alone without the Hero). , so he could do his thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempt of sympathy for a character that we do not have to take care of. Or, weird things like the car set to stop them long enough for someone to escape.) <br /> <br /> Try to be modern, try to be an exploiter, even try a final turn that does not surprise in the least, and try to be exciting. But a lot of almost identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horrible shots, bad acting, etc. It does not make an exciting movie.
