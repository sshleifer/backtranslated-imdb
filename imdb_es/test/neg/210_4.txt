One of those movies where there are no big twists at all and you can predict what will happen. Matt Dillon was amazing once again, but the rest did not play a more important role than they should have. <br /> <br /> It was exciting at first, but a bit slow and predictable at the end. It is one of those. movies in which the good wins, no matter what happens. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it. Personally, I thought it was not worth seeing. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have turned it into a B-movie by designing a happy ending.
