This (very) low budget movie is fun if you're a John Krasinski fan, but otherwise it's disappointing. At least it was short, so I did not feel that I had wasted too much time. The scenes of John are funny enough, but the attempts of scenes "deep" with Lacey Chabert are quite nauseous. It starts out looking like it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are so extravagant, while the others are too serious to simply fall. Do not make me start with the ending. It was totally implausible and it did not even fit with the rest of the movie. However, I will say that I did not get bored, which is why I rated it above three. John Krasinski fans will enjoy watching him with a handkerchief and stockings around his head and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and be sure to check out the deleted scenes from John, they are better than some that were included in the movie.
