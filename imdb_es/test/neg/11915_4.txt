Based loosely on Earl Derr Biggers' novels, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series turned out to be a favorite of the public, but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio feared the public would turn on its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: the actor Sidney Toler took on the role of Monogram Studios in the "poverty line", where he continued to play the character in eleven most performed films between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox had considered Chan's films as low-cost "B" movies, but still the studio took great care of them: the plots were often silly, but the rhythm was sharp, the dialogue witty and the molds (which featured characters like Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a kind charm that has withstood the test of time. The monogram was a different matter: the Chan films were simple and plain "B" movies. Little attention was paid to the scripts or the cast and the resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, virtually could not be seen in the worst case. <br /> <br /> Thanks to an appropriate cast and some interesting plot devices, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is among the best of the Chan films made by Monogram, but still barely achieves consistent mediocrity. In this particular entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is called to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra bite; at the same time, he decides to make sure that a government radio supply hidden in a vault of a bank, of all places, remains safe. Do these two seemingly unrelated story lines come together? Well ... it could be! Sidney Toler is always nice like Chan, but most of his Monogram performances seemed like "phone calls", and that's as true for COBRA as for any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the really nice artist is Mantan Mooreland. Changing times have led us to consider Moreland's comedy as demeaning to African Americans, but he was an expert and comical actor, and in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has a great charm and innocence. <br /> <br /> It's likely that fans of the 20th Century Fox series will find Chan de Monogram a big disappointment and newcomers who like Monogram movies will probably consider them third-rate after meeting with them. Fox movies. Like other Monogram Chan movies, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is best left to certain collectors. Four stars, and that is being generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
