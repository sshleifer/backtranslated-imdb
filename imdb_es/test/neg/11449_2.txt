The topic was good, the address was fine. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as Major. The acting of the secondary actors was, in the best of the cases, amateur. The casting director and the director must be responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, it stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look at the part or move like a soldier. There was a scene in which the satellite feeding of the skirmish was required with the militants and they showed it from a camera angle. The satellite is located hundreds of miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was a very embarrassing moment. The audience these days has matured and recognizes when one is trying to remove the wool from the eyes. The director is a commander, so the story could be outside of his personal experiences. There is no problem there, but the film is as good as its actors and its Director. So if Major Ravi goes for other projects, he should pay more attention to the casting.
