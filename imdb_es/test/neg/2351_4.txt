The subspecies is established in Romania, where two American university students, Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) come to study local folklore with the help of local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There they rent rooms in a hotel and are curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there and stole the Bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm ). . Radu is proud of the three girls and begins to drink the blood of Mara and Lillian, while Michele falls in love with a boy named Stefan (Michael Watson), who happens to be Radu's brother. Michele and Stefan decide to form a team and get rid of the evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this film seems to be much appreciated among the fans of the genre and although it is not terrible, it certainly would not. I call it very good and I really could not see much to get excited. The subspecies is a fairly slow movie, in reality it does not happen much and, although it tries to be close to a certain classical tradition of vampires, there is all this nonsense about a bloodstone and some small monsters that grow from the tips of the severed fingers of Radu for some reason. The subspecies could have been a decent half movie if it were not for the fact that it is boring, I really can not remember much about it, neither good nor bad. The characters are fine, but the dialogue is silly and there's a scene that bothered me near the beginning when the girls are in the castle ruins and one of them says they have to go because it's getting dark, but it's still clearly half the day . very bright. There is also a scene in which one of the American girls finds a coffin in the attic of the hotel and it really does not seem to bother her, I'm not being funny, but it's a guy in whose house she had a coffin in her attic. Be very, very worried if you know what I want to say. I do not think I'll ever want to see it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes the classic themes of Vampire with silly subplots, and that did not impress me at all. It's not the worst movie of all time, but it's not the best either. <br /> <br /> The film looks good with nice places and some local landscapes, although you feel that the appearance depends on the budget instead of the manufacturers trying an authenticity. There is not much blood other than a decapitation and some broken finger tips. For no apparent reason, the creators launch some animated animated monsters in motion that do nothing or have much meaning for the story. <br /> <br /> Shot at low cost by Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment production In Bucharest, Romania, production values ​​are good and better than in many later Band productions. The performance is not very good, since many of the actors in the cast are below par while the genre Angus Scrimm has a small cameo at the beginning. There is a bit of style here, sometimes, with some scenes that remind us a lot of the original Nosferatu (1922), in particular, the fragment that shows the shadow of Radu that goes down the stairs with his long claw like prominent nails. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a movie that many like for reasons I do not see, I thought it was quite normal at best and generally quite boring. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and the spin0off film Vampire Journals (1997).
