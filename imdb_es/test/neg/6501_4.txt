Avida is a word game that mixes life and enthusiasm, but personally I think that this film was exaggerated by its ambition and does not do justice to its title. Gather a set of uncomfortable characters linked by incredible links. Also, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images ... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I probably did not realize it! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it goes on again and again it is no longer bearable. I must say that I fought hard to keep seeing it until the end, and I'm still not sure it was worth it ...
