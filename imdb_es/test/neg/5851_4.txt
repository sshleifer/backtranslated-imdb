The RAT RACE ads made him seem too young to enjoy it, but as my boyfriend loves this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally gave in and saw him with him tonight. I make him see David Lynch movies and all kinds of dark indie stuff (I recently forced him to URBANIA), so I felt I owed him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I did not want to hurt you. feelings, so I saved myself from complaining about you. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but it irritated me a lot. Let's start from the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie," so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene was about a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mommy, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no other purpose in this movie than to put a little bit of evil into a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while still in the casino segments, it is quite convenient that all the characters play, in the same period of time, the slots that contained the gold coins. What would have happened if they did not? Would these millionaire players simply sit down to wait? And how did they get those gold coins in the slot machines in the first place? <br /> <br /> But I'm working out a plot point that is necessary for the film to exist, so I'll keep going. About Whoopi and her lost daughter a long time ago: they are meeting for the first time, but throughout their hard experience they do not argue with each other about themselves. Why make your relationship so presumably complicated? Could not they have been, say, a mother and daughter on holiday together? Why the business of an adoption long ago? And why portray the daughter as a tough career woman chained to her cell phone who never needs contact with her business? Did you forget the script for this secondary plot and character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film: the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; It is exhausting when everyone is equally crazy and without identifying features. And another thing - the events are not plausible. Oh, sure, the characters can do some extravagant things, but the characters must be believable. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie), for example. Frank Drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (Jane is also fun, but it's a different kind of fun, which makes all the difference). A character in RAT RACE that defies natural laws by jumping on a moving train, destroys any chance of seeing the movie. clearly they are not real people, so why should I worry about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral one. The characters get their modes of transport almost entirely for theft. I know, I know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions did not bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there are many violations of the law in RAT RACE, and that bothers me now. And I will not delve into the whole sequence of airport sabotage, rather than wondering if the writers did not consider the real implications of such an action; Was that scene funny before September 11? <br /> <br /> I will skip the unpleasant details related to the heart, the family drug and the Nazis (whose accumulation and reward worked best in an episode of "Seinfeld"), and move on to complain about the performance. Rowan Atkinson started annoying and ended unbearable; I do not know when I like a comic character less. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi came out better, but I did not have much to work with (although I loved the permanent copper coating and the purple lipstick); Kathy Bates' part was sharp but fortunately brief; Cuba, it was ... oh, man. Cuba, baby, please fire your agent! Following INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is his third attack (please note that he has not seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS): it is time to return the Oscar to Best Supporting Actor of '97 to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, by FIRST FEAR). . An actor of your size does not have to run half naked in the desert and be watched by an imitator of Lucille's dance. Do you already read the scripts of your films or you put yourself in a bag and take out your next project at random? <br /> <br /> There are other small points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker find out the loot so fast?), but, basically, RAT RACE equals little more than its basic batch of types of characters that are hampered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather disappointing and inexplicable ending. Do you give the money to charity? What kind of ending is that?!? Yes, it is the "noble" thing to do. Does not matter the possibility of cross-promotion / licensing Smash Mouth whores (do you ever say no to the sale?) Organize a charity concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would do that with sincerity? Yes, they say it's the trip, not the destination, what makes a trip worthwhile, but there is no journey without a destination. If there were ever an example of a "wrong happy ending", it would be this. What a final annoyance for a film of which, despite what I did here, I enjoyed some parts (I confess having enjoyed the part with the cow and some of Lucy's things along with the character with the pierced tongue, at first I thought that it was indecipherable - the speech went up a wall, but it became my favorite). <br /> <br /> But from what my boyfriend knows, I found RAT RACE quite fun and charming. <br /> <br />
