This is one of the most horrible movies I've seen in my life, probably only surpassed by the dreadful and completely mindless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even have put his name on this shit? I am feeling more and more of the respect I felt for him, that he is rapidly declining. <br /> <br /> So, what's in this movie that makes her so poor? Is it the story? Yes. Are the actors? Yes. Is it all the "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> To start with the story, my God! It is as clich√©d and predictable as what you would expect from a 14-year-old drunkard who arrives late writing his article in "What I did this summer." The sense of well-being that creators seek to achieve simply drowns when we suffer another shameful turn of history. <br /> <br /> The actors are amateurs, I know, and therefore we can not expect them to be theirs. The same quality as professional actors. But for this to work, the characters HAVE to be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so that the viewers do not mind that they act with impudence, or maybe even join the characters. In this case, it does not even close baby! You begin to dislike the characters slightly, and at the end of the movie (I think they last about 90 minutes, even if they seem like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt someone so you can understand these annoying and stupid guys! It should be impossible to find the humorous intent of this movie successful unless you are yourself like these stupid hickeys. His lack of talent and credibility mentioned above in terms of acting, only makes the nonsense and too simple scenes fall more to the ground. Even the family of people involved will have a hard time finding this, but very embarrassing (I would prefer that my sister cheat herself with American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why did you cram in a lot of Norwegian celebrities out of place? They look even more out of place than the actors, if this is possible. These famous characters simply add to the cheap feel of the film and it is in itself a transparent shot in the dark when trying to improve something broken even before its onset. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to underline how much I'd rather see dry paint than to never see this movie again ...
