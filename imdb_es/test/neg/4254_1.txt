That was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Why would someone make a movie about escaping with murder? Mr. Allen re-interprets the only type of character he is capable of, the sexually atrophied man who can not catch the girl. Get a clue, Allen, there's a reason he's the only character you can represent successfully. Get away from this movie! It's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to kill someone successfully. I'm sorry for the actors who say "yes" to Woody Allen. Look at your cast and tell me how many of those people are still working. My respect for all the actors, who work for him, diminishes immediately, because they chose to participate in the film.
