I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed useless. By showing the backgrounds of the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go wrong. Most were useless and did not help the movie. This was not the best time of Dennis Hopper either. However, the main salvation of this film for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, it almost makes Mr. Rubio look like a good guy. All in all, it was observable. However, I kept thinking that some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.
