I love Lucy, but this movie is so bad that I writhed in shame for everyone involved in the first ten minutes. . . And it got worse from there. The "singing" of Lucille Ball is downright painful and the attempts to make her look younger through the use of a soft approach made me reach for my reading glasses. It's pumps like this that give the pumps a bad reputation.
