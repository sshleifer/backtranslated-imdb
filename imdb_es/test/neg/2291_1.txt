I really want my review to be a word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me NOT to rent this out, no matter how tempted or bored I was desperate to see a new horror movie, because it was a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I have not talked to him in a long time, and I was in a hurry to choose a movie, and I thought: "What the hell, how bad could it be?" WHY I do not learn? What was I thinking? Did I think that magically it would become a better movie while sitting on the shelf for years waiting to be rented? <br /> <br /> The 'argument' refers to a guy who edits movies for a company. Your boss is an idiot. The guy who had the job before him went crazy and immolated himself in the sequence of previous credits, so, for some reason, the boss chooses Nerd 'Ed' for the special edition project of the films of the series "Loose Limbs." He never says what Ed is supposed to edit, but I guess that does not matter. Ed is upset by some of the clips, working on them in this house on his own whom the boss decided to relocate for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss does not care. He begins to go crazy slowly, supposedly when he sees the clips, and wants to carry out the bloody murders in real life. Or has it been like this all the time? Keep in mind that I am making this plot sound much more profound, interesting and coherent than it really is. <br /> <br /> We do not care at all about the characters, nor do we have sympathy for them, not even hate the bad guys. The plot is really boring and predictable. The splash is not even so scary or creative, this is NOT worth renting just to see the gore, because what there is is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All the 'tributes' to Sam Raimi only come off as really bad scams, and no one in the movie is handsome enough like Bruce Campbell, so you can not get distracted by that. I think a "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only displayed prominently in one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and does not consider any kind of legal action. A trained chimp could have written a better script. Every time I hear phrases like "Are we having fun ... yet?" (Even Bride of Re-Animator could not achieve without a wince) I began to feel like catching some kind of deadly weapon. The characters simply appear from nowhere without any explanation, wandering only to be killed. This could be fine if the movie was even entertaining or entertaining, but it was all I could do to avoid fast-forward through most of it. Fortunately, I chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was played. Trust me, it did not require all my attention; I still felt that they wasted more than 90 minutes of my life just for having this in the background. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, no matter HOW tempted. you are, you will hate yourself for wasting your money. Fans of terror will be completely disgusted at how incompetent he is. Even those who have not seen too many splash movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there that can be rented that are worth much more. If you want something brainless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete the loss of time without redeeming qualities at all. Be smarter than you were at the time and do not be fooled by the "Warning: not for the faint of heart" in the box. You have been warned! <br /> <br />
