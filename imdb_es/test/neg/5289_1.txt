I started seeing this because I thought it was really fucking porn. While I was still watching, the only emotion I got from this movie was discovering what it was called to search and tear it. I just finished and I considered finishing my life knowing that someone really made this movie. <br /> <br /> For the people who commented that this movie has a good script and a great performance, my words of wisdom for you are that you probably do not have any friends because you were in the movie. You're probably looking forward to having all that time back in your life that you wasted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> There's no way this is a serious movie. There was an old guy who was stabbed and did not even hurt him. And when everyone else is stabbed, they fall dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people kill people at random and eat them, and that they were also with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put the parts in his body. . <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found the "hemoglobins" or how you write it because that made the film seem very intellectual and probably helped reach the older people. <br /> <br /> What really amazed me was that they decided to include that random scene about the college girls who go to the forest in search of fake skulls. <br /> <br /> If you try to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hair dryer and prepare to jump. <br /> <br /> THIS MUST SEE IT ... for anyone who believes that life can not get worse because it will. help him to realize that there are people (the creators of this film) who are even more pathetic and who are not going anywhere in life.
