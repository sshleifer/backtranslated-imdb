I have to agree with the previous critic. Although Kristin Erikson did a great job playing the girl possessed, seriously I do not think Isabelle, the character she played, was possessed. I have seen people who have psychotic pauses due to sexual abuse, and never made it clear if the father had abused her or not. I also had to see some parts once more, to clarify what the lyrics said, what were the names of the characters, and I'm still not clear about some things that happened, whether they were real or not. . I am trying to find the "original" story on which it was based, to compare facts, but it seems that I can not find anything about it online. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. As for the special effects, the film was not bad for a Grade B, more or less, and those scenes of possession made it all worthwhile ... that is, if you have nothing better to do. LOL
