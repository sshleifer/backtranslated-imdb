This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Tales of two fists" contains three silly and childish episodes: the genre is not really horror or action, rather as something in between. Where is the suspicion? Where's the fun Where's the common sense? It is definitely not here, but if you do not expect to get it, you do not necessarily lose it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd western. I could not understand the whole idea of ​​it. "King of the road" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "Tales of two fists", it was just a pretty face that really did not know how to act yet. Fortunately, he learned the skill later and is now a fantastic and talented actor, one of the greatest of the younger generation. The story is almost fine in all its stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost completely successful. It's silly but fun. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch when you sit in an armchair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that's what I did.) If you loved the "Tales of the Crypt", you will also love the "Tales of two fists" because, basically, it is the same. I understand that these three episodes are really "pieces of art" extremely rare and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS but I do not think it's a great privilege. You'll have to be a Brad Pitt fan to look for it. Otherwise do not bother, it's not worth the effort. Silly shit
