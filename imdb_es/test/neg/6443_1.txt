My wife and I observed this abortion from the beginning. I hated it immediately, but my wife got hooked with him for a couple of years. For me, it was getting worse and worse, and the characters were, without a doubt, depressing and depressing, without any redeeming feature. My wife got tired of that and we stopped looking completely. Occasionally, I capture a clip of it or cross it when I navigate the channel. There is always someone screaming at someone or doing something terrible. There never seems to be lighter moments or happiness of any kind. That was always my main complaint when we saw it for the first time, without humor. The writers seem to have no idea about the drama, they seem to think that conflict is drama, and of course that is just one element of it. Light and shadow are very necessary and actors who can contribute something. I am sure that the actors in Eastenders are competent but have nothing to work with. It must be the most depressing acting job in the entertainment world. I do not understand why the British public looks at him and loves him. What the hell does he say about our psyche? I have heard it said that it is "like in real life"; It does not look anything like my life or anyone's life, otherwise we would be throwing ourselves out of tall buildings or public transportation. The issues it addresses are far from being seen by the family, but are still shown before the basin. I love the series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I do not expect to see them at 7:30 or 8:00 at night. The program is big garbage and should be avoided at all costs.
