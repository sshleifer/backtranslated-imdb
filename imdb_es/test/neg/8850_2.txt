It would be promising if it were a student film. He never seems to know where he is going, as if they decided on each subsequent scene as they were making the film. As a result, a lot of repetition and a deadly rhythm. There is an absolutely confusing procedure by which ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the Internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious graduate student, retired behavior, red rooms, dark spots and then suicides. Good luck discovering the connections, or when a character is a ghost or simply acting strangely. The characters are barely sketched, which might be fine, but they are completely uninteresting. It is too long and ends just when it reaches a promising stage, although the conclusion does not make sense. Weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give incoherent advice.
