The first time I looked at the back of the cover of this movie, it seemed that my friends and I could expect 82 memorable minutes. And it was certainly memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you wonder how it was possible. How was it possible that it was released on DVD. Of all the movies available at the video rental store that night ... we could have chosen the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me, even a little. Who came up with the idea that it would be fun if the narrator could change the story with suggestions from the main character? Of all the stupidities with which you can ruin a movie, this is now my favorite. The character of Foggerty, the idiot of the town, played by Nickolas Grace, is the most annoying character since they began to make films in color. If there's only one movie you should not watch this year, let it be Puckoon, because I do not think it could be worse. I still wonder if this could have been the worst way I have spent my money, and I trust that I have made many miserable purchases over the years.
