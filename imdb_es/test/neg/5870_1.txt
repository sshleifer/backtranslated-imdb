It is often difficult to decide which is the best movie you have seen, as this may vary according to the genre, the preferences of the actors / actresses, or even the mood in which you find yourself on a given day! That said, this movie is, by far, in my opinion, the WORST movie I've ever seen! I thought the acting was terrible (was there any?), The plot was just an idiot, and the props were totally false. Could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? I do not think so. Even the friends with whom I saw the movie agreed that it was the worst video we rented, and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie.
