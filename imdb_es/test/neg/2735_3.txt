This is a very, very, very bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the performance is bad and the science is worse. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not convincing. The dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way can be seen a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no suspense. The best aspect of the film is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason not to give this one a lower vote is because it's a television movie and I think the budget was low to begin with. <Br /> <br /> I think the young girls of Luke Parry will still see this movie, however, he has done a better job. Again, this is Terrible. Very, very, very terrible. If you have an option, look something else.
