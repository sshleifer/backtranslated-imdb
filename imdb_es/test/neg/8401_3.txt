It is difficult to decide who or what is the target audience of this movie. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the opportunity to explore the problems of amnesia at a serious level and chose to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie. After having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses, which explores the loss of memory, even if it is the result of Alzheimer's disease, in a deep and heartbreaking way, not only in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre , I think Novo is an insult to Se Recuerdos I do not have any problem with soft porn per se, and even if I did, I would have to stop going to the cinema so often today, but I have a problem with the writers / directors that They try to relate it and hide it. Like here in the guise of medical research. The sad thing is that fine actresses like Julie Gayet, so wonderful in Clara et Moi, and Anna Mouglalis, who seems to have hit in a double play after last week's Le Deluge and now this, are wasting time in the scum of this way.
