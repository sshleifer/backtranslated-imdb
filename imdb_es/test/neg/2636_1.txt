This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes; I can not see how the producers agreed to finance it. <br /> <br /> We are never given an explanation of NOTHING. The acting is horrible. The plot stinks. Obviously, this movie was written for children under 8 years. <br /> <br /> I have to say this: why do high school classes last only 2 minutes? The teacher enters, finds a frog on the desk, or draws on the board, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, the class is over. The children have not even opened their books. Can we have at least some continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the reincarnated and aborted fetus, a zombie thing. Do we really need the line? "This is the office of Dr. Jeter, Dr. Jeter, the father of Milo." Thanks for the advice; I could never put that together myself. It will never improve. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo talk the way he does, even at the beginning? Was Milo ever "real"? Or was it never real, just what it is today? And if it was always like that, why did he have the inexplicable 'accident' that Milo had? <br /> <br /> Besides "What is Milo?", what are all the unresolved elements for? We see all these gadgets in his father's medical office, and we are never given an explanation of what they are for, or what they have to do with history. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium widget? Obviously they are not necessary. (See the movie, it will make sense). And what does this medicine do to someone? Apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the main actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very, very bad scam of all the other Slasher movies. It's a really horrible Friday, on November 13 from a 10-year-old writer. It's not corny enough to laugh at, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.
