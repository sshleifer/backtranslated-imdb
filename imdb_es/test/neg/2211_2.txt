Meltdown opens in a scene of scientists preparing to perform an important test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids if they are in the process of colliding with Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some doubts about his, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then, the asteroid breaks and the largest piece is pushed in a direct collision path with the earth. Fortunately, the huge rock jumps out of the earth's outer atmosphere and bounces off into space. Unfortunately, the blow is enough to alter Earth's orbit, and the planet begins spiraling closer to the Sun. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening above their heads, the Tom Cops Angels ( Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are in a redefinition. They are supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug trafficker, but the agreement they are seeing quickly becomes a shooting match. Then, Tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who is also his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> At a nearby hospital where Mick is treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief talk with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he's worried about the fact that his 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). Once Tom explains to Bonnie that he discovered that CJ has a criminal record, she is also a little worried. <br /> <br /> It does not take long before everyone has something else to worry about. The temperature is increasing rapidly throughout the world. Carly is one of the first people who are not scientists who learn what is really happening. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to tell him that he could have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; He, of course, communicates quickly with Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short time, the motley crew is on the road. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they have to fight their way through gangs of looters, deal with a catastrophic water shortage and travel at temperatures high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a handsome guy, and actually I enjoyed it in Starship Troopers. That may be because he is good at action scenes. It could also be because he did not talk much in that movie. On Meltdown, unfortunately he only has enough lines in situations that are dramatic enough to show his completely average acting abilities. Amanda Crew is also fine, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also reasonably good, but Venus Terzo unfortunately is on par with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie is the story and the script. While the story here is fine and actually has some real potential, the script is just horrible. The scientific part of science fiction is nonexistent, since the asteroid pushes the Earth out of orbit and increases with the idea that the "gravitational balance of the solar system" could "push the Earth" into its usual orbit "with the weather" . "When the temperature in Los Angeles reaches 120 degrees, the cars begin to explode. <br /> <br /> Do you know what is even worse than the bad science? Bad continuity, it's fine, very hot. What are the people in the film not only wearing long-sleeved shirts, but also jackets? Why do people assault each other with bottled water instead of opening the taps at home? Why the streets are completely empty, but the Are motorways completely full? And why are motorways full of unexploited? It is almost superfluous to observe that sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when that only forces me to say that the editions were not. <br /> <br /> Then, basically, you get a good idea of ​​the story and combine it with a mostly mediocre performance, a terrible script, low-end special effects, completely irrational plot turns and bad editions, And what does it have? A movie that is even smaller than the sum of its despicable parts. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: Here it is mentioned that Congress finally loosened enough funds to finance the tests that initiate the film shooting While the tests here were totally irresponsible (point to an asteroid with a nuclear weapon and not to know the composition of the big rock is, in fact, quite irresponsible and to approach the crazy ones), the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger for the planet. Unfortunately, we have not tracked anywhere near all the near-Earth asteroids that may be worrying in some orbit someday; and our ability to detect something in a collision course with us is, in the best of cases, limited. <br /> <br /> Once we discover that we are going to be hit, we literally do not have any system to deal with that. There are no space missiles with nuclear points that we can launch; the space shuttle is completely unable to go beyond Earth's orbit, and if it were, we could not launch enough or launch them fast enough to matter. I do not like the government to do anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly believe that protecting the planet from the destruction that comes to us from outer space could be interpreted as a defense of the country, is not it? FITNESS OF THE FAMILY: Meltdown: Days of Destruction is rated R for "some violence." Frankly I did not find violence here beyond a video game with a fairly typical T rating. If your teenagers are interested in seeing Meltdown and you can not dissuade them, the R rating should not deter them from letting them see it. However, it is not a good idea to leave younger children in the room with their older siblings. While the shootings are not too graphic in general, some of the dead bodies are.
