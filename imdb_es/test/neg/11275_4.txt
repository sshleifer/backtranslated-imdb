With some movies it is very difficult to know who they were made for. Golden Eggs seems to point to the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be many internal jokes in this movie that you will not understand if you are a stranger. This can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the film alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths. madas Duchamp lists. In addition, the main character also has a special ability for karaoke tapes with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why all this is mixed in a pretty nice way, but also free, just elude me. I can only assume that everything serves to highlight the vital, impetuous and rude vulgarity of the main character that the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. How all really pretty women run after him (the main character, I mean) is a bit disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The movie has three parts. It begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the engineering corps. Then he goes to the tourist city of Benidorm, in Spain, where Benito just wants to build the tallest skyscraper in the place and become a vulgar Howard Roark. For the last part, a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably to start a "new life". But the change of places is not explained satisfactorily. It is also somewhat irritating that there is no character development and that the film descends into a soap opera mode without being convincingly ironic. It must be said that Javier Bardem fits very well with the interpretation of the young stallion that weakens and deflates. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I'm interested in Urban Landscapes. And Benidorm is a kind of special place, city. In this respect, Golden Eggs satisfied me only partially. In She She's Killed In Ecstasy (1970) by Jess Franco, this specific location was used in a more rewarding way.
