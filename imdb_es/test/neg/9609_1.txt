There are so many things that I do not like about this program, it's hard to know where to start. Unpleasant characters, horrible plot lines, terrible writing, and terrible acting. I do not even mean the music of the unpleasant subject. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, the program is out of touch with US audiences. UU Due to the abundant Canadian references that surround it. "Oh, please, Derek, will you go to Queens College in the fall? How did it go? <br /> <br /> Of course, other programs are recorded in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate: Atlantis, but while those programs may have suffered some discomfort (like Rodney calling ZPM a "Zed-PM") I do not know focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs Degrassi (another program based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during daylight hours when no one is watching to fill the time (most teenagers are in school when it is broadcast). I would bet that it is for the same reason. Programs that focus on teenage life in Canada do not translate well into a United States audience. <br /> <br /> This program should be canceled and the remaining teachers should be burned in an oven.
