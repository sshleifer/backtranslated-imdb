Terence Stamp can wear anything, but this is a shallow one-dimensional movie. It's nice to see, like the actors, and if you like drag queens, I think you'll like it a lot, but the plot and the characters are as fine as cardboard. It is one of those politically correct films that distorts everything else so that a "minority lifestyle" seems warm and tender. You get a lot of miles from the bitch dialogue, which is fun in this sanitized way, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action is parading with flashy costumes in incongruous situations. The dramatic content is a symbolic appendix: they just try to take it seriously.
