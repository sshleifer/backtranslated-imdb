Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and the producers believe that we are all idiots. If not, how should we understand this? <br /> <br /> The American pilots take off in the Mig-29. Suddenly, all the planes go to the F-16. Ha, a magic! After an action ... Migs lands. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention that the F-16s had Israeli marks? <br /> <br /> Another magic: obviously unarmed The L-39 coaches are bombarding enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: while all the films are located in Europe, we can see a desert on almost every flight. scene. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director wasted all his magic on the things above, because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also the explosions look terribly as if the pilots were bombarded with Molotovs. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, this is a movie I should write about your story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is ANY story in this movie. And it's horrible too.
