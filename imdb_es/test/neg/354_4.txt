I would barely know that, a year later, MGM put Norma Shearer on THE DIVORCEE, which shines with the technical knowledge of MGM. How far they came in a year. CHENEY is a very scenic early talkie. The camera barely moves. Shearer is his usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. Everyone is very careful to speak clearly and slowly in the microphone source, which mitigates a dramatic scene that flows naturally, but the game is a robust and fun workhorse, so one can enjoy if the expectations are not too high . Oh, by the way, the plot involves a group of high class jewelry thieves who infiltrate society to take advantage of their victims. There are some smart twists in the script and true love conquers everything. An Oscar nominee for Best Adaptation to the Screenplay.
