A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is so exuberant led me to foolishly revisit this DTV entry of the mid-90s. A child is traumatized when he sees an Ice Cream man shot to death in the 1950s and grows up until becoming a psychic man of Ice Cream (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and ends up in the ice cream. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) did a pornography career before this and then returned to it. That's what you get for all the murders that happen off the screen. And for choosing a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit. Just throw a fat boy! In addition, there is a scene in which Vincent reacts stoically to a group of crazy escapees that surround him. He was totally drunk and scared for his life or the filmmakers captured his "Have I really sunk so low?" shame fills in. Despite being a low-budget garbage, this caused some good names to line up, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and Doug Llewelyn himself from THE PEOPLE COURT. How can you make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me.
