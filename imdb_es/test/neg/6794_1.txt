The fact that this crude series can provoke dozens of comments (let alone hundreds of 'votes') speaks to a large extent about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Lee Proust, you imbeciles! ! Or at least the anthologies of Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrap your brain with the fact that to qualify or write about this series you should have spent minutes ... in short, HOURS ... watching this poor player step on the boards and spitting lines with less emotional impact than the girl who is used to cancel the correct time in your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SHOW! REPLACE YOUR FEW REMAINING BRAIN CELLS!
