This film and several other films from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately represent all pagans or anyone who is not Jewish or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on stories related to the Bible that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. <br /> <br /> Any movie that preaches about the "one true god" gives a small change to the freedom of religion. The films ignore the fact that the lack of religious freedom of ancient Judea made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. Most of the religious films of the 1950s also overlook the loss of freedom that occurred after Christians assumed political power in the fourth century.
