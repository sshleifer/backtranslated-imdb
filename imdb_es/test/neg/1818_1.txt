This series continues frustrating and bothering. How are you going to extend this for another year? Each episode offers more and more questions, while providing answers to very few. To quote another very popular website, I think this program has now jumped the shark! <br /> <br /> Will I still see it? <br /> <br /> Probably, <br /> <br /> Will they be able to keep the program on the air until it's over? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... <br /> <br /> How two qualified doctors did not realize that Naomi was still alive? How more than 30 people did not notice that a corpse woke up and left with a knife still on its back? How was someone strong enough to create two paths and climb a tree to ambush Kate? <br /> <br /> Now we have introduced a ghost ... <br /> <br /> The same week next week? Yes!
