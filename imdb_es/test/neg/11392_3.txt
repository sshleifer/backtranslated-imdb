This strange little movie starts with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and is beaten every day. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother, Angela, who is a dressmaker, does not think there is anything wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but they ignore her and when the two walk back to their car, they are harassed by the other children and thrown with eggs. Bruno's father, Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally upset because his son is a sissy and practically repudiates him. Bruno meets a new student at school called Shawniqua (Kiami Davael) who is a free spirit and dresses up as Annie Oakley with guns. Angela suffers a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother intervenes to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very hard and unpleasant look at all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno wearing dresses, as she practically encourages him. His mother told Dino that his mother was a small child because he liked opera and now refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school that Bruno attends is very ungovernable and all children run wild and even call Shawniqua the word "N". Once Shirley MacLaine intervenes, the film changes and is oriented more towards the family (so to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The ending after the spelling is incredibly artificial and "feels good". Hugs and applause for Bruno as the reporters follow him and take his picture for his papers. Meanwhile, Shirley MacLaine is acting as the "broad, tough band" that confronts everyone. There is one thing about the character of MacLaine in the film that nobody has mentioned in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of it. I think Helen's character could be a lesbian! She is very strong and strong and at one point in the movie she shares a drink of whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I do not remember anyone in the movie who mentioned who her husband was or if she was ever married! That's why I think your character could be gay. Many other good actors appear in the movie as well. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan should have taken a look at the script before signing. I guess when they heard that MacLaine was directing it would be an honor to be part of that. Very difficult to feel remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject is probably impossible to relate for the majority. The actors are not bad, but what exactly did MacLaine aim for? Tolerance towards a child who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? We got it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I was trying not to shudder.
