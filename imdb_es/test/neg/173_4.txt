Was it really necessary to include shameful images of non-participants in a documentary? And why all the silly dog ​​scenes, and then the repetition of the same silly dog ​​scenes? This film begins with a great promise: to expose international politics and the wine business. It had a great start and included all the right characters. But production is a disaster. The points began and developed most of the way, then never ended or were left with ends hanging. Very poor and disorienting work chamber and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British murmur of Christie's. <br /> <br /> Too much fluff and not enough done for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored in Cannes for the attack on the United States (although in my opinion, there was very little of that). <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am, I have no idea how much longer it lasted.
