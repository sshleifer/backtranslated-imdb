I know many people like this program and I apologize to people who think that this program is amazing, but it is the worst program ever created. Sure, I'm sure he would be a big fan of this program if Jeremy Clarkson was not in it. I mean, I think trying cars and doing things like seeing if a car can beat a plane is amazing. But Jeremy Clarkson is simply pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man: Think it's cool to fool speed cameras that measure your average speed by measuring your distance and time by driving 200 mph on the road and then resting for two hours. . Clearly think that it is better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend saying pathetic things. . He yells at the children just for taking a picture. I'm sorry top team, but Jeremy Clarkson is a phenomenon.
