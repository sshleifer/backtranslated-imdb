I do not think I've seen such a bad horror movie since ... Hell, I do not think I've seen such a bad horror movie. The single performance was enough to make one shudder. The bad acting was far beyond the corny horror movie. It was just horrible. And did you look at those terrible special effects of God? When the demon (who looked more like a puppet of cheap construction) came out of the wall, I could not tell if he was supposed to be scared, or to laugh. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than a little disappointing. I could not help noticing that the director is from Portland, Oregon, which is my own hometown. I must say that I am deeply ashamed. If I could, I would give 500 negative to this movie.
