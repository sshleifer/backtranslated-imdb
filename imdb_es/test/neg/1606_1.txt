The horror of this made for the TV movie was that it did not end with this one. It generated a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / movie. Most films about various professions have some kind of realism and, of course, they are encouraged to be exciting. This did not have any of that. If the intention was to do in "Camp", then he succeeded. It reappeared on the cable a couple of years ago and failed again. The performance of Richard Jaeckels as the Master Chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film. Campier than the Batman series of the 60s.
