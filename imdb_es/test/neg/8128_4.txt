Sebastian Cabot is a rich imbecile who wants to buy all the land because there is oil, although none of the locals is aware of the oil. With the help of an evil gunman in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to back down and faces these forces of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. As I watched TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before and I would probably see something like that again. This is because, apart from some novelties (like Sterling Hayden who uses a harpoon in the bad boy), he has an all too familiar argument. Once again, we have a rich guy who is trying to expel all the farmers to gain control of the entire land. And, to do so, he has brought contracted weapons to force people to sell or kill them. I've been there, done that in too many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in the movies, but I can not recommend this as more than a bad step of time.
