It is not surprising that many of us hate classical music; And what do the children think? With "educational" public relations like this, serious music will soon pass from life support to the morgue. Children know when they are being told no, and this is not an exception; Why can not someone good make a movie about classical music for children? I must admit that I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven, took on the role with enthusiasm and with a deep balance of the moving and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; He obviously did his research. Otherwise, this is a rehash of third category of the old format ABC Afterschool Special, without the occasional charm that those short films had. Sorry for the rant, but this is an important issue that young people should know, and it could have been done well; I wonder if the musicians or the filmmakers were responsible. Either way, children are more modern than you think, friends ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
