I saw this movie last night, and let me tell you, it's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie is a train crash, and it's not the actors. It is the horrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Well, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. Your nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Get a free vacation. He goes along with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Your ships crash. They stay on an island. They are stupid and do not even bother to look at the nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's all. What makes this film pathetic is humor. It's so horrible, ridiculous and stupid, you can not even laugh. And humor is not stupid either. I could not laugh at the whole thing.
