Clossius says that "Baltic Storm" is prohibited in Sweden. That is not right! Instead, you can buy the movie almost everywhere, such as at gas stations, shopping centers, the Internet (of course), etc. Often at a very low price because this movie is BAD and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep the interest. The film only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychopaths and other people who live on the ground and those who "know the truth". <br /> <br /> Working in a museum with the disaster in Estonia as a theme, I've met you all! I have heard of all the theories that exist such as cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, extraterrestrials, Russian-American-Estonian-Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some normal people have asked why we did not show the movie? A question that only those who have not seen this terrible movie made sense of. <br /> <br /> Once again, "Baltic Storm" is not prohibited in Sweden. It has some fun qualities, but what the hell is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
