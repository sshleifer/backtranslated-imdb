This movie was one of the worst I've seen in my life, did not leave out a single clich√© that one could imagine about a so-called Hollywood suspense. The protagonist is a caring father and a private investigator who is dedicated to a special task: to discover if a suspicious "snuff" movie is real. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he gets involved more and more deeply, sullen pornoshops (led by Mexicans and sexual theaters are his field of research while looking for the murderers of the woman in the movie "snuff." Assisted by an employee of "smart" sexshop (he read a book), he's catching up with a producer of killer bondage movies and his personal perverts who are responsible for the movie ... ... and what do you expect? bad simple, without need of explanations, background, history: they are the bad guys, and he is the purifier Auge Killer of the assassins End of the film Is that so bad? Yes, I'm afraid so. > <br /> Ironically, "the machine" (the mega pervert who committed the murder) even points to his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces the "machine" to remove the leather mask (yes, for of course you are using one) and recognizes that the "machine" looks like to the normal type 08/15 of the street. Then "machine" says: "blablabla, I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I love doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I love killing people. Yes, of course, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It is not just the lack of character that made this film so boring, but also the ugly "I have to kill these people" attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero has tied one of the killers and tries to shoot him ... but he can not. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the murdered woman, tells her that they kill her son and asks if he loved her so much that he wants to see the dead killers. The mother cries, yes, she would love her son, he returns to the tied killer and kills him. <br /> <br /> To get to the point: this movie breathes the disgusting air of lynch-supporters (the police certainly do not play any part in it), moralizes ridiculously against pornography, does not take seriously the characters and wastes time with a stupid plot. Probably, the only good thing about this movie is that it does not try to perform a pseudo psychoanalysis ... even that would be an excessive plot. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this. <Br /> <br />
