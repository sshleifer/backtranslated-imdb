"At the Earth's Core" was on television yesterday. I was working on my computer and, by chance, I took a look and saw what must have been one of the worst action sequences ever made. I was instantly captivated by the shoddy production values ​​of the film, the gruesome acting (all-inclusive, including Peter Cushing) and the hilarious gruesome and hilarious action sequences and the puppet monsters. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scientist. He takes a stereotyped Buff American Hero on a boring trip in the Welsh countryside. Little do they know that a great evil lurks in the center of the core of the earth ... <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the title does not make sense. (If they were really at the center of the Earth, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and would be burned alive in an iron sea or whatever is down there). Forget the puppets used in the production of the rival "The Beast Master" for being the strangest of all time. No, the true genius of "At the core of the Earth" is his naive stupidity, a gung-ho action show with no real action and no real spectacle. In essence, it's just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one. People who enjoy MST3K style things will love it: it is terribly bad, and in fact it is so strange that it is enjoyed in a strange way.
