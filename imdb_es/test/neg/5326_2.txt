One of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema. Wait, I'll give it back to you: this movie can not be included in any category related to "movies"; belongs to categories such as "waste", turds or similar categories. Ironically, they are even two garbagemen. The film is "Men at Work", a light crime comedy starring the brothers Est√©vez (Sheen) of 1990. Leaving aside the plot asinine and implausible, bad acting, bad dialogue, malicious tricks and slapstick, continuity errors and high rate of nameless actors who will never be seen again, anyway it was a pretty bad movie (in essence, I mean). It was the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn each line and, in a simple way, repeat them in public with your wasted friends, thus ensuring your status as the biggest fools in your class. tenth grade. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually sent an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie's IMDb website, if only because I saw a silly punk music joke. that apparently nobody else has seen yet (on the statue of Butthole Surfer). I am so conflicted about why I should even waste my time sending what seems to be a supporting trivia note, when what I really want is to exploit Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he has already done it himself). Thank you, friend!) I am very happy that you * spent * only time on this, not real money. For that matter, can I have at least one-tenth of your budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better films with just what they spent popping cars, carefully placing the bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and beating the useless extras (trusted men) in scrub suits. I would mention Emilio's writing credit, but it would be an exaggeration to call this script "writing," it's more like cartoon ideas scribbled with crayons. And Charlie Sheen, if you're reading this, I assume M.A.W. You must have done it during the part of your career when you were a grumpy Hollywood brat and had not grown yet. (Oops! I'm sorry, I guess part of your life is not over yet.) Recover soon, "half man." Such a promising talent, so wasted * ah, look at that word again.)
