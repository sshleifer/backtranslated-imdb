The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a hint of star. Well, it's okay, Amy Adams deserves a little effort, but the smidgenometer does not seem to be working, so I'll stick with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... Do you see a trend? Aaron Sorkin ... My God, it's not an opportunity. <br /> <br /> I could go into several paragraphs about how the Charlie Wilson War ignores history, morals, legitimacy, etc., but I do not think any of these disturbances can overcome the emotion of the fans of Aaron Sorkin. The rest of you, be careful. Spend the money from your movie elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Even so, if you are looking for a concise comment, here is mine. You can put hot chocolate sauce in a pile of garbage, but it does not change anything. Garbage is garbage and Charlie Wilson's war.
