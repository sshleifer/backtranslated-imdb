I give it a 2: I reserve a rating of 1 for the films of Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. We do not even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we remember is a bullet scene in which the actors fall to the ground, roll to the other side of a corridor or something and then shoot again. It was like seeing children of 80 with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'tricks'. Also, when the characters were traveling in a truck, the noise of the engine (or the radio? It can not be remembered) would disappear completely when the actors talked. <br /> <br /> And, like others, we bought it due to Sandra Bullock's cover. very sad, very bad
