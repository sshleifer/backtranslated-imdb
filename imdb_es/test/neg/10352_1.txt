The best I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be making money for this shit. Yes, the American scam was shown for about two episodes in Australia, but it was not rated; Probably by the curious spectators who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and do not easily accept the nuances of the script written in Australia. Bad luck for them since they are condemned to collapse with this turkey. My advice to the US viewers UU Is not. <br /> <br /> Americans are advised to find DVDs of the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but keep in mind that some DVDs are in a 'zone format' different from the ones issued. In the USA. Otherwise, some DVD players will operate discs from both / all zones.
