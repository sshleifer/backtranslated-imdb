Poor Casper Van Dien, his career has moved far away from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> At Meltdown, he is a cop who is dating the television reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten and his brother is a scientist who is trying to deal with a commentary for speeding to Earth. But in the business of fugitive comets, even a nearby fault causes some real problems as the Earth's orbit breaks down. <br /> <br /> From the survival of the Earth, we pass on to the survival of Van Dien and his immediate family. . His daughter's gangster boyfriend, Ryan McDonell, actually proves to be of some use, especially when he suspects that a guy he knows as a crooked cop can mean a lot of damage to the Van Dien group. <br /> <br /> My only question here is, why did not they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to deal with the nasty comet? <br /> <br /> Pass these people up.
