The opening was a theft of "Freaks of eight legs", a movie that is all that this is not. Stilted and pedestrian are the words that are applied, along with others that can not be repeated. The vagabond guy returns to his hometown (?), Meets old friends, etc. The usual annoying child, single mother, local speaker, etc. Does not the director see "Close Encounters"?). Good performance? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cut? Not here! Do not rent, unless you are sharing the cost and have a large amount of beer on hand. Do not watch television, go and drink a lot of beer, you'll enjoy it more!
