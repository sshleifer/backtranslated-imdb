I'm not surprised to find comments from users for this film full of nonsense, like this movie "[proof] that when it is predestined, love will find a way". I start this way, not to criticize a specific critic, but because this quote typifies the hyperbolic and uncritical core that was spilled on this film, even before it hit theaters. Even the best films do not "prove" anything, nor are they destined to do so. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails in both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the promotion of the study of "The English Patient": "From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'," he announced grandly. An ignorant or careless listener could miss the crucial word, "producers," in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of "The English Patient", very inappropriately, with the great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to Mr. Forman's memory. <br /> <br /> While the novel by Michael Ondaatje on which the film was based is good, it is unfortunate that the film has not captured any quality. of the book in no way at all. Apart from the elements of the plot that seem coincidentally similar, the film is little like the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the misgivings that started when I heard that blatantly deceptive promotion, I went to see this movie in the theater. When it began to develop, I realized that the interpretation of the peculiar magic of the novel had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring and unattractive. The film was a complete farce of Ondaatje's novel and a completely dead cinematic artefact of the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who make fun of this movie are very apt to talk with adjectives like "sweep" and "great" and "hypnotic". Well, it's nothing like that. In fact, not even Ondaatje's good novel could be described as "overwhelming" or "grandiose". It could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic"; however, these are precisely the qualities that the film failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella, as a reader, had completely lost the value of the novel and could reject with celluloid only a pale and skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but focused on the characters wrongs He produced a film transliteration that not only had no respect for the metaphors of history, but also for his apparent knowledge of them. <br /> <br /> Minghella moved the focus away from Hana and Kip and put it in the Patient and Katherine. Clifton, thus losing the narrative trail of the novel, as well as the "essence" of it. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas incorporated unattractive, uninspiring, unmotivating and unmoving performances that they were obviously meant to convey. a great adventure, passionate, loving for the spectator, but which, in fact, offered only an inexplicable and superficial link between two adulterers, shallow and uninteresting. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unattractive, and neither of them offered the viewer the great emotional response that Minghella's grandiose and exaggerated presentation obviously intended. <br /> <br /> The "Great, Radical, Similar to David-Lean" The qualities that the many indiscriminate critics of this silly movie love to refer to are simply not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is a positive insult to another great director. Take, for example, the scene of the "Patient" sandstorm, which is undoubtedly one in which these "great and radical" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not Great, it's not even convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and its appearance after the storm, which was no doubt supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, was completely devoid of drama or emotion, in fact, because it was so obviously weak, it had An air of comedy about it where the comedy was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. Failed as a representation of the novel, and failed as a movie. It seems to have been the "Oscar anointed vehicle" of the year (joining a film theme as exaggerated as "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). We can only thank God that even the Acadamia driven by exaggerations <br /> <br /> had the wisdom to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly worthy performance in the excellent film "Fargo". There was not a single performance in the execrable "English Patient" that was not shamefully horrible (Willem Dafoe) or a mediocre performance (Fiennes and Scott Thomas) really forgettable. <br /> <br /> Why this does not - the identity of a film retains a group of devoted devotees (and clearly no taste) will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will permanently bury this mediocrity of a film and, fortunately, they will not have the strength to dig themselves up.
