Basically a road movie. The themes of homosexuals, transsexuals and other gender issues are quite disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. You have to hand it to costume designers. As for the actors, the only one he was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I guess it was a very good performance, outside of its normal range (or anyone's). The film as a whole was superficial, just a vehicle for intelligent and malicious jokes. In general, I do not recommend this.
