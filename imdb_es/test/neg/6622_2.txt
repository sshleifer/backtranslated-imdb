top of the carrot in a long-running movie, said enough. The only reason why this is not obtained is through my personal voting system of only 1 1 and 10, and this is not an extreme operation. horrible horrible god there are some movies that are so bad that they are involuntarily funny, then there are movies that make you feel bad physically and then there are those that lead to a serious contemplation of suicide. burn all the copies of the film, shoot anyone who has had a non-creative contribution in this film, torture anyone who has any creative input and, as for the star, there are only many things that can be said online, but I should be asking for the final. Ten seconds of existence with a severed head at the time the work is done.
