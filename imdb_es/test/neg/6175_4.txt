There are many different problems with the movie "KillShot". On the one hand, there are too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and it turns out that he is hunting the day the main murderer appears, with someone who knows the killer. Okay, I'm going to take that one. The boy calls the real estate agency for which the wife works and asks for money to be ready when he comes to look for him. Okay, I'm going to take that one too. Before going to look for the money, he decided to rob our murderer, who does not kill him, but decides to go with him to work. It is starting to be very weak. Then they appear, the same day that the husband has an interview with his wife's boss. There is no one other than the wife and husband who has decided to enter the empty office. They go to the office and the professional killer simply assumes that they are talking to the right man. That's only in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie than I would like to talk about. Why the killer did not just kill everyone in the real estate agency, I do not know. Why did not you shoot the woman on her porch, I do not know. I do not know why he let that stupid kid do all those stupid moves and mess up a lot of shit. Why the girlfriend was in the movie, I do not know. Why he decided not to pocket the weapon and just leave it on the counter, I do not know. Why did they even enter the witness protection program, I do not know. What I do know is that the Casting Director did a great job, the Director of Photography did a very good job, the Location Scout chose excellent locations and the Production Designer was worth every penny. Therefore, my advice to anyone who chooses a script that will be well-worked by the crew is to make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the killer is not thwarted by a spike through an open window.
