How the hell were these guys given funds to make this movie? The lack of a script is one thing, but cinematography makes you want to cry. A handheld camera can be of great value for the appearance of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what you are doing. I am well aware that the actors are amateurs, but he has no defense, since the director could be the least talented he has ever directed in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or anyone in the team for that matter) receives money to make a movie ever again. This film simply fuels the argument that too many films are made in Sweden each year.
