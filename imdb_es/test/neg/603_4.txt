I discovered that this movie was mainly a POS, it was low budget, but that is not the problem. The problem is that the movie is simply unconvincing. It really does not make much sense. Yes, it explains why things happened, but I do not mean that. there was simply no reason for it. The movie also moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than this. Also, I think they overreached a bit in the murders. It means they were too disgusting, but the killer seemed to spend too much time crushing his victim in the head or stabbing his victim. Maybe I'm being mean, but I just did not like the movie. Everything seemed like a lower rate version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe that was the point. But for what? for me "When To Kill a Stranger" is a 4/10 *
