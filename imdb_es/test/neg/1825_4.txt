I observed it basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have references to the Third Reich. It turned out to be a pretty smart and predictable slasher movie that seemed to be made to attract feminists or something like that. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, if you wait for a full movie to see the attractive breasts of leading women. The last thing you want is a sex scene made with "good taste" with annoying camera angles that show nothing. His busty friend did not take his, but we saw many butts of men, pubic hair and men without shirts. And in the end you have our heroine magically dodging the outbursts and blows of the villain (who turns out to be the piece, curiously) and she easily fights with him (uh eh) while his male love interest is tied and waiting. to be rescued. The funniest part was when she lifts a chair and "swings" the guy and breaks over him. Now it would be almost all I could do to lift the chair, much less crush it against a person with enough force to break it! It seems ridiculous, she basically rubs against him and falls apart. If you are going to do this type of "reversal of roles" (which has already been done until death), then you have to at least make it semi plausible. <br /> <br /> However, there was a good part. The evil one managed to defeat his fucking friend, teaching him a lesson for being so vagabond and sleeping. That is not exactly something that feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Really stupid. Not that American slasher movies are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bothered you. It did not bring anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
