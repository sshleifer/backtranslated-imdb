When this movie premiered it caused a sensation. I saw it and I got excited. Beautiful women, usually young and naked filmed in the elegant style that we knew so well from the photography of director Hamiltons. His photographs never turn into porn and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw him again and he disappointed me bitterly. The soft core in scenes of extremely slow rhythm, all filmed with some Vaseline on the lenses, is really all there is. There is no real story, the characters are still beautiful bodies and beautifully filmed, but they are not real creatures with soul. Actually nothing happens. It's as if Hamilton were photographing with moving images instead of photos. And this gets so boring after a while. I did not even see it all for the second time, because I fell asleep. That's all that remains of this masterpiece: it's a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it! <br /> <br /> At that time 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
