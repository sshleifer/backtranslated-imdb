I'm not sure if this revision contains spoilers, but I'm sure there could be spoilers. In any case, it is unlikely that anyone will see this movie that is not familiar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old joke about how to work intensively and bring a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on Indians than on Americans. By adapting it for television, McMurtry and Osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in whites than in reds. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not yet know about Gus, Woodrow and his friends. So the film offers us mainly a portentous prehash of what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". The Indians, who have their own story to tell, are largely relegated to the background, so much so that someone who has not read the novel will rightly wonder why it is called "Luna Comanche". <br /> <br /> The novel does not have a general history, nor much of a "point". This could have been solved in the film, tracing more strongly the contrast between the Indians who lose their lands and their way of life to the invading Americans, who bring "civilization". This opportunity was lost. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Loneome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships, at least among Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians have been eliminated or greatly shortened. And for a four-hour movie (net), it's remarkably episodic and choppy. One has the feeling that the script was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The script is mainly composed of dialogue clich√©s, aphorisms and common places. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show", it is a surprisingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to solve problems with the story and characterizations, but they did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogue in the novel is missing or altered, without any obvious reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred towards Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) for always fleeing to be with his "pard". That small and revealing revelation of Clara's sexual jealousy is gone. Then there is the scene where Uranus Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harder; the film attenuates her, and she does not show Woodrow as a socially stupid and emotionally frozen stone that she is. (When I read that scene in the novel, I wanted to punch Woodrow in the stomach, or worse.) There are other changes, some of them understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut; For this he would have liked to have an expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump does not have a hump! (Maybe it felt unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to put on such a huge prosthesis). And the character of Buffalo Hump is "kinder and gentler." It is nowhere as grotesque as it was violent as it was in the novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this close turkey is the remarkable performance of Steve Zahn, not as much as Gus McCrae, but as Robert Duvall. Gus McCrae. It's strange. It duplicates to the perfection the gestures and the way of speaking of Duvall, without appearing never "deliberate" or self-conscious. As was Duvall, he is completely "inside" the character. And it actually shows us that Gus is becoming "more Gus" in the third part. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it will not ruin our affection for "Lonesome Dove", not just a Great Western, but a great American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think that Rachel Griffiths was exaggerated, that's how it was in the book.
