This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen. I hope that the REAL family and other characters represented have lawyers that sue the hell of VH1 for their interpretation. The acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the representation of the characters is scary. It's supposed to be a drama, but for me it was a comedy, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. In general, I like the performance of Flex Alexanders, but this time he has completely missed the mark. <br /> <br /> You could argue that he took this role for a couple of laughs, because it was very horrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS. But if some laughter awaits you for bad acting and stupid writing, Tune in. Apart from that, do not waste your time.
