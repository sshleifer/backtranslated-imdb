Because it came from HBO and based on the IMDb rating, I saw the first season of this series, what a waste. The characters are occasionally interesting but mostly they are like cartoons. Performance varies from good to mediocre talent, with a special emphasis on the latter. Not only the prisoners, but also the spectators must leave all hope in the door of the cell that this story is credible, it is a load of manure that will need an unusually strong testicular strength to continue observing. Violence, as with most developments in history, is exciting and any supposedly served morality is of the Lite variety. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes the quality of writing, performance and general production observed in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SEIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate illiterates, look at OZ. Things like these give the nerves a bad name.
