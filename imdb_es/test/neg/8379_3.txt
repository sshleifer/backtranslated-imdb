The two most notable things about "I Will not Play" are: he won an Academy Award as the best short film of two reels of 1944; and was led by the leader of the silent era, Crane Wilbur. The plot of this short run-of-the-mill is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the performance is not better or worse than that found in most of the Hollywood films of the 1940s ( in other words, it is horrible). It is true that there are times when "I Will not Play" is fun: the completely artificial aspect of Janis Paige and the delivery of lines are beautiful, but one laughs at the image, not with that.
