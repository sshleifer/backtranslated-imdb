Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... WHAT? This movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason why Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans, just to break their hearts. Kill a man, get shot and die before the end of the movie, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point where he died ... WHY put it on the cover if your character BLOWS? . 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. It was too confusing, I mean, what about the girl? She had to narrate the movie to TRY to get our attention, she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie ... it fails. Now I'm going to see 24 ... THIS FILM FAILS!
