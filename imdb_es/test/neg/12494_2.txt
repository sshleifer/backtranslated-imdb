This movie was obviously made on a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It seemed that they made no effort to make the "future" look less futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an office building of the 80s and all the cars that explode are from the late 70s (I guess they did not want to fly cars that cost more than $ 500). In addition, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he partially financed the movie). Finally, they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new society "cyberpunk". Not only does this never become important in the film, but later, when Don needs surgery without anesthesia, why do not he go out and buy heroin or legal morphine? The whole movie is as careless as this one and completely anticlimactic, since Don easily exploits an "unstoppable" Cybertracker in about 25 minutes of the movie. However, if you find this movie cheap or free I would see it, the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole movie.
