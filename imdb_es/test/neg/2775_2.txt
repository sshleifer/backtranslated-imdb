This is a cheap movie made by Al Adamson, a man who was perhaps the worst filmmaker in history, even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specialized in very low budget horror and leather films during the 60s and 70s and 80 and with titles like FVE BLOODY GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it's obvious he was not doing Shakespeare! All his films had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting. <br /> <br /> Here at BRAIN OF BLOOD, several Adamson actors (like his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto agree). The trip had already appeared in Adamson's previous film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. This is fortunate because the previous movie was so terrible and so badly executed on all levels that BRAIN OF BLOOD can not help but look good! Sure, the makeup is ridiculous. the plot is silly (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and the acting level is Z, but YET is better than your last movie! <br /> <br /> About the only positive things about this movie is that the aging supporting actor, dwarf Angelo Rossitto actually had a better part than usual, with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot , and in reality there is a certain sense of danger and tension. As for Ms. Carrol, SUNS looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limps through this silly movie. However, it is bad enough for movie fans to have a good image, you just have to see makeup in the guy with acid burns and in the lightning gun that seems to be made of an old back light!
