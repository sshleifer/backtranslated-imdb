This is one of the most horrible 'horrible' movies I've seen for a while. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was bored and wanted a distraction to make this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks of the Land of the Lost and the Creature of the Black Lagoon. Also, they should have used someone who was a little smaller, since the Chupacabra of the legend is much smaller. In general, however, the movie was so bad that it was fun. Why bullets and electrocution could not stop the Chupacabra, but the kick kick boxer's daughter did well? Observe if you are sick at home or feel sick and need to laugh.
