"It may contain spoilers" Sadly Lou's latest film Costellos has the distinction of being a little better than Abbott & Costello's latest film "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not all terrible, it's a fun and failed race. Dorothy Provine is nice to watch and makes the film somewhat bearable. You can not blame Lou Costello for this because a large studio launched it, which meant that someone had to give it "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello was overcoming the problems of his own loss of his son a few years earlier and the unjustified attacks of the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 films of Abbott and Costello, you may notice that the magic is gone. Take a look at "Dance With Me Henry" now that it's a painful movie to watch.
