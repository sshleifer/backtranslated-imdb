I have to see this crap in this way to see if there are redeemable qualities to justify their inclusion in my clients' video libraries. Do not look at this, not even a minute, unless someone has a gun in your head. Like I did, you will moan and moan at least 500 times, and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, will turn you around and kill you. <br /> <br /> Even if you're the biggest Sandra Bullock fanatic in the world, it's not worth even seeing the two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want to kick ass the poor marketing people who put Sandra's on. A huge picture on the face of this DVD box and send them to jail for robbing me or something. I really wish I had the opportunity to read a review of this movie before buying it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I will pay you $ 10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it appears. It stinks all over the place! (Just kidding, please do not call)
