In short, the only saving grace that this film has is the setting, the costumes and an OK punk concert. How would H.R.Giger feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this film, I would not like to know. Immediately, all I could do was make sardonic comments about the protagonists of the films, I hoped that the "monsters" of this film would execute them in a bloody way. I feel SPOILERS is coming! I was wondering if this movie in the spirit of the first 20 min. Was he meant to be half as funny as the rest? Examine all obvious political protests (the police attempt to rape a "monster", the discussion of superficialities between the "monster" and the fraternity boy and the punk concert with the female vocalist) and the use of slow motion in the Fight sequences (screaming "martial arts coordinator") I just do not know. The character named "Steve" bothered me as he tries to fight with people from the street (he should have been assaulted and raped) and he looks bad when he broke that guy's neck towards the end (I want to show you how to do it)?) To say this, however, if they had developed other characters better than "Splatter", this could have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this movie, I would have achieved it, but unfortunately it is a 1.
