This movie is from the 80s, but it seems that it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are too cheesy. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, so I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes in total. Most likely, she denies any participation. <br /> <br /> In summary, there is not a part of this movie that is worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it is. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made, without exception.
