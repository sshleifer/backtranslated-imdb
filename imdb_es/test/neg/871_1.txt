This movie is the final straw. As two dedicated fans of romantic comedy, this film has finally made us realize that nothing good has come out of this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good in the movie at all. It was an affront to love, death and everything else. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This movie took the spark from Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can not act to save her life. She was not convincing in her laughter, crying and dancing. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to see this movie. Save yourself The romantic comedy is officially dead.
