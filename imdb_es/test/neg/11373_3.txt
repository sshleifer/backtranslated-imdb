I gave it a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what is sad is that I was interested in looking for the film calendar of that channel so as not to miss the opportunity to see it. I wanted to see this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I hoped to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Mrs. Wilson felt about the film, but I thought it was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> It should have been intriguing, it was a mystery, set in Spain, and the protagonist, Cassandra, is a language translator who is contacted by a mysterious and beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a lot of money to locate her ex-husband, Ben. <br /> <br /> There are many secrets revealed, but for some reason it just did not matter. It was like, oh, and what. I could not get involved with these characters or worry about them or feel them. I could not even identify with these characters. <br /> <br /> I think a big part of the film's failure was the actress who plays the main character. She looked old, tired, exhausted, and as bored as the water on the plate. His hair was a perpetual mess, his baggy clothes were boring and simply not attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was listening to a Dean Martin recording, but even that was ruined. for the strange makeup used by the man who danced and synchronized the lips with the song. Believe me, it was nothing like seeing the graciously handsome Mr. Martin playing him. <br /> <br /> The end is so thorny that you would like to have some pancakes to accompany the syrup. <br /> <br />
