As I said, sometimes the low budget is good. You can watch a good movie without many of the additional BSs that can hide a piece of trash. Well ... this was that piece of shit. In any case, I thought I had humor, unfortunately the humor was not intentional. The only half-witted performance came from Bill Smith and his part was cut (it's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there a cast that could act. Even Gerald Okamura stunk, and has been chosen in almost 40 films. The fight scenes were funny and made me feel like I could kick all of their $% # @ # $. The sound was horrible, as if all the sound was recorded on the set. My 10 year old son could have written a better script ... By the way, my 10 year old son fell asleep ... no kidding. I give a B + to the edit to cut the movie to only 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
