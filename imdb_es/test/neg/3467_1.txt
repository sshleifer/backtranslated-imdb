Many of the negative reviews here focus on the historical accuracy of this film. Granted, it had as much to do with the real NFL as its average war movie has to do with a real war, or a Western has to do with the real "old west." So, I think we should give them an artistic license pass to that. <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the director (Clooney) apparently thinks that doing an inflation comedy means a) doing stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) taking stupid stupid scenes and extending them too much time. Screwball comedies need a fast rhythm, not necessarily frantic, but move energetically at all times. Here, things drag, and drag, and drag. After watching this movie, it will make you appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he practically pioneered the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you would think that the directors would have studied the old masters and learned one or two things, maybe they even improved things a little. But no, it's as if someone had seen a car pioneer build a Duesenberg, and almost a century later, he paid tribute and "improved" the concept by making a cart of a child with square wheels. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several of Clooney's films, I consider him a talented actor. But very few actors can competently address themselves; Clint Eastwood, in particular, took a while to master it. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more visible during the few times it is out of the picture, but when it is in the picture, it becomes the center of attention. In the fighting scenes, your assault is so unpleasant that you wish someone would really hit you. <br /> <br /> If you're making a mindless comedy and you want to get a little romance, you need to develop some chemistry among men. and the female carries. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of a couple of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem contraction. Zellweger, who has also produced some pretty good movies, must have changed his botox injections for oak tannin, giving an amazingly wooden performance. It is possible that she has only achieved the act of "a big, tough woman in a man's world" if only once, while trying to outdo the testosterone guys, she had looked at the camera with a small half smile and glint in her eyes . But no, she kept her jockstrap tight until the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is just not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Doing stupid things in a very inventive way, like the Stooges, or very athletically, like Buster Keaton, can be very funny. But otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. I think I have a good laugh about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. I saw it for free on cable and I still wanted to get my money back.
