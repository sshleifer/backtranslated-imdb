I spent three months living in the East End of London in the second half of 1987, when the program had been on the air for almost two years. There it was considered a joke. <br /> <br /> Why? Because I had a totally white cast. All cast members and more in the first years were white. <br /> <br /> The street where I lived was long, with more than 800 houses and, to my knowledge, it was one of only three. or four white faces that live in that street. We were at the corner of the Indian and Turkish "quarters", and even if you exclude those two races, Asians and Afro-Caribbeans outnumbered whites from twenty to one. Also, of course, of the few white people who * lived * in the area, the vast majority were Scottish like me, there was never a "Cockney" accent. <br /> <br /> That was not a racist Uproar, just a simple statement of fact. The BBC did not bother to cross London to do their research before writing this soap, or they only had white actors available and decided to bluff. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I say, in The East End of time, we consider it a comedy show. :-)
