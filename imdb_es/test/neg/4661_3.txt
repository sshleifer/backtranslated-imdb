Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> I have found in my movie studios that every time Michael Bay makes a movie, people criticize and hate it, but still they go to see it and earn around 100 million dollars . . Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the five best directors of all time. Along with Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has established himself as the best action / adventure director in Hollywood. That point is demonstrated with his most Panamanian film, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> An asteroid the size of Texas is rushing towards the planet and the only way that NASA can think to bring it down is to take a team of men the asteroid, drill to its core and release a warhead nuclear inside and then explodes the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough to do it: Bruce Willis. Willis plays Harry Stamper, a hardened oil driller who tries to hold together what's left of his family. Not helping that fact is his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), who has an affair with her best puncher, AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), the head of NASA, Stamper and his team of drillers to train the astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part movie. First there are the funny parts where we meet the gang and crazy people abound. Then they get into space and all the comedy is absorbed by the window and is replaced by amazing special effects, good music and a great performance. Murphy's law goes crazy in the second part, which means that everything that can go wrong, in fact goes wrong, increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew (Michael Bay as Director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as Producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the writers.), tons of special effects, great humor, music incredible, in addition to an introduction made by Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon Rocks Big Time. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parent Warnings: This is not a children's movie. The F-bomb is used several times and many other bad words are also used, plus there is a scene on the Strip bar and the extremely intense second part can be too difficult for a child to handle.
