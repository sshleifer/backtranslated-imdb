This movie is without doubt the worst action movie I've seen in my life. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious one) is when a chicken runs across the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing error makes the movie absolutely fun for about 2 seconds, then returns to "do not stop, on the edge of the seat, while you try to find a comfortable position to sleep, action!
