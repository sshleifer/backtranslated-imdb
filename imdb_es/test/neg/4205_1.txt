Ever want to see a movie in which Chuck Norris takes the bad guys to one side and calmly discuss with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, shake hands, correct the mistakes of the world together in peace. And harmony and forever ending the reign of evil in the world? <br /> <br /> Well, forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" instead, he goes straight to the kicking kick when Chuck drives his cargo truck into the small forest town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawyers. <br /> <br /> Chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and wrinkles cuts all the evils in sight until you dare a wicked to raise your head. Many of the fights are in slow motion, for reasons of emotion, but they only help to fill the film so that it fills up for 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of fights here, which leave only about 15 minutes for the plot. Development ... and that's all you get. But what did you expect: quiet discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and that's a small 10-4, good friend.
