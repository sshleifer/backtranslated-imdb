**** It will probably contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to get attention (I would not call to make sure you get help before dying as a "failed suicide attempt"), Joey discovers that she is pregnant and begins to see images of spirits. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was a bit slow, but entertaining enough to see the whole thing. For a horror movie, there were only a few chills and minor emotions. Halfway there, however, there was a really good scary scene (although I would not reveal it) :) I watched this movie because I really liked the previous movie, The Eye. however, to determine that, apart from being a film of "supernatural suspense" from the same creators, The Eye 2 had NO relationship with The Eye, * at all *; Different cast, different story. The Eye2 does not even have anything to do with the eyes: \ <br /> <br /> The movie had some questionable scenes: Joey tries to commit suicide 3 times (4 times, if the moment witnesses say they saw Joey) trying to jump in front of the train), they associate her with brutally defacing an attacker, she gets scared in a restaurant and the witnesses say that she was "attacking" people and, nevertheless, she is allowed to deal with her affairs freely, without even do what. a psychiatric evaluation or hospitalization (for reasons other than pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The movie was not the best horror movie, the story was quite unlikely (even for a fiction movie: P) The spectra were few and / or nothing that we have not seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the spies, it was an interesting twist in the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> I rate the movie 3 out of 10.
