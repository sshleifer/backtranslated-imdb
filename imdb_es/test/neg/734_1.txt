Again and again, a movie appears by accident that makes you doubt your sanity. We just finished studying the novel, "Northanger Abbey", at school and decided to refresh our memory of this piece of junk without humor with the adaptation of the BBC. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it really makes you want to commit suicide. The movie is NOTHING like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have become transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like an elf in acid while Isabella plays the role of whore. Catherine, the protagonist, is the most stupid and irritating actress in the land of God (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketballs), while Mr. Tilney looks and acts like a porn double retired. The plot is completely out of the rails at certain points in the film, I do not know what the devil was thinking the director when, for no reason, a black boy of 7 years that we have never known takes the main character. Get out of the abbey and start spinning in front of her. Yes, that's right, shoot. This type of nonsense is interrupted occasionally by "fantasies" of Catherines in which an ogre takes her through a cathedral. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is basically a visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something like that. that, basically, the BBC has discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a film just ridiculously bad. Do not look at it unless you're in a padded cell.
