Every once in a while, an indie appears that has an incredible cast and a story that sounds really interesting and that you can not miss, but the movie stinks. Some recent movies that belong to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and now here is "The United States Of Leland". <br /> <br /> This incredible cast includes Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (killing a retarded child), but does not remember it and does not seem to have any motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the children's room who is trying to understand Leland (and also exploits him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see his deteriorating relationship (due to his addiction to heroin) in flashback. It sounds like an awesome little drama, huh? I also thought the same. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is wrong, badly written. The dialogue and the narrative are painfully pretentious and full of common and irritating places about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie clich√©s, and although he manages to make Leland sympathetic in some way, he ignores his crime. <br /> <br /> For the most part, there is no problem with acting. Gosling (who was worthy of an Oscar in "The Believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but by the way they are written, none of these characters (let alone Leland) feel like real people, so there's not much that you can do more than murmur your ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable one. She has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen. Even playing a character subscribed in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with a single glance. When you have good material to work with (like "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"), it's really amazing. <br /> <br /> But this is not good material. Maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been worth it, but as it is, "The United States Of Leland" is heavy, inert, and for a movie that seems to be in love with how "deep" it is, it's really superficial.
