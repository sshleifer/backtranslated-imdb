I liked the first The Grudge. It really scared me and I had something that made me want to see it twice. That something was missing in this sequel. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really adhered to your mind. It's people dying because a terrifying ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. And most of the time, it was not even that scary. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but they did not give her anything to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so fast. I was also disappointed by the secondary plot of Kayako's mother. I was thinking that she could provide some way to fight rancor, but she dies in the hands, hair? - From Kayako. That was such a stupid turn. In general, it is difficult to feel that the characters that know from the minute one are going to die. All in the same way. And there is nothing they can do. It does not feel like a cruel destiny waiting for them. It's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. If they had something to fight with, that would have added suspense, even if they had failed. If there was any hope, it would make the fear more justified. Now you're just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was very scared in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and that took something away from us. I was still scared during some scenes, but I actually got used to big eyes and a blue face. The manufacturers obviously realized that this would happen as they added other terrifying ghosts. Yes, I was scared at the school psychologists scene, even if I knew where I was going as soon as she said "I've been in the house". A good touch. Toshio, however, was not scared at all in this movie. I felt much more frightened by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a blank look that sometimes appeared in the first film. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters seemed really unnecessary: ​​the notorious scene of milk with the girl whose name I can not even remember comes to mind. I was not afraid, it was just "Eh?" I'm not sure if the schoolgirls were really necessary. Karen could have brought resentment to the United States with her. He could have killed people related to his life, everyone at the funeral, or something like that. Even so, it would have been boring to watch them all die, but the fact that they introduced themselves to so many unrelated people was really annoying. I hated the scene "I will not call you mother". The problems of Aubrey's mother were equally boring. However, the little boy was a moving character. <br /> <br /> The sequel to Ju-On was much more terrifying than this one. He had some new twists, dreams and reality were much more blurred, for example, and even if it made me feel rather dejected, I was also somewhat satisfied. I have to think a little and leave myself thinking. This movie only provided cheap fears.
