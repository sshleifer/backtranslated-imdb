After starting to see the repetitions of the old Columbo movies, I thought that they would all have the same vote as me (6). But apparently now I'm starting to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of the previous episodes, which showed a good direction of genius, and is shown in this, but in a negative way. in the newspaper instead of watching it (it never happened during a Columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The address seems too pretentious. The scenes with the neighbor "oh-so-mature" are a wrong place. And generally the lines and the plot are weaker than the average episode. Then, the scene where they debated whether or not to fire the trumpeter (who was falsely accused of the murder) is a real horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, some "prelude" applause should be given. In this episode, a lot of attention is paid to how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence, etc. I liked that a lot. But, unfortunately, we do not focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the "proof" that finally leaves Columbo victorious is the stupidest of them all. <br /> <br /> Rating: between 4 and 5
