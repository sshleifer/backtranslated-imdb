In general, this is a pretty bad movie. But for $ 5 at PathMark, it was not a total waste. <br /> <br /> The whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this woman infected with snakes, supposedly from a magic curse. Actors / actresses are not big names (although some look like TV shows), so I will not do what you tell me about Troy McClure. <br /> <br /> For a while, the movie is of interest to you as the couple takes a train and travels to Los Angeles to see a shaman to undo the curse. There are also other plots underway; like two women who traffic drugs. <br /> <br /> But the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total disappointment. No matter how violent and bloody the whole movie is, the grand finale is totally animated by computer. <br /> <br /> I saw the unrated version that had tons of language, blood, blood, violence, everything! The characteristics of the bonds were good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: D-
