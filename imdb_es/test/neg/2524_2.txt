I had read online reviews praising this dark excursion as a combination of bloody horror, extravagant black comedy and border art; The film has elements of the three, no doubt, but they are at the service of such a stupid premise (the title immediately gives up the game). And the amateur production to boot? What about your long-term negligence due to lack of proper distribution? Basically until Cult Epics picked it up for the DVD release 30 years after it started! ?? It was not a big loss for the cinema or even for the genres. Apparently, the bed was created with the purpose of accommodating the flirtation of a demon with a woman; Anyway, a dying man who had used the four-pointed poster and even painted it, is trapped on the wall behind the canvas (!) And provides intermittent commentary on the "action". Several people (from teenagers in an adventure to gang members in hiding) provide fodder to the bed that is always hungry; The last ones in the menu are a trio of girls? One of which, however, reminds her lover of a long time ago and, consequently, the bed seems to dread her! Looking at several objects ?? From cigars to pieces of fried chicken? and the people who are swallowed (the belly of the bed is represented as a container of honey-colored liquid) make the film slightly funny at times (especially when the hands of a young man are reduced to his skeletal formation, which seems to take pretty good) easily on your way!), but also terribly repetitive, so that, in just a brief 77 minutes, the whole senseless exercise feels tense and desperately desperate.
