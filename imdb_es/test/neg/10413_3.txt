Lonesome Jim is a kind of romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two children are total losers. Both boys of about 30 years, living at home, with absolutely nothing in their favor. I live in the Midwest and I can not name a family like that. I picked it up because I like Buscemi's acting humor. Now I realize that I need to have an agent that counteracts that humor to make it work. The acting and camera work and editing was fine. The first 15 minutes helped him establish, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the movie from being totally depressing. The female members of my family begged me to turn it off, but I prevailed on the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the whole movie. The male members of the family, as expected, simply withdrew after the first 30 minutes.
