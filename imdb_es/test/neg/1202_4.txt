... But definitely only deserves 4/10 stars and no more. The father of a foolish and foolish child is a fighter pilot who is shot down by an Arab country. They never name the country in the film, it's really ridiculous, they just vaguely refer to some Arab nation, this movie is really as ignorant as that. But Lamar from Revenge of the Nerds is here, he's friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives in an Air Force base, his father is an Air Force pilot, but he does not manage to enter the Air Force academy, he conceives a conspiracy (with the help of his delayed friends) to steal two planes and go rescue his father Yes, exactly, this is one of the best movies ever made! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can say that basically I wanted to finish off Doug Masters in the whole movie. Well, anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can not believe they made 3 sequels of this movie.
