When we see Enterprise for the first time, as we all certainly do with all the shows, I entered it with an open mind, enjoying almost half of the previous efforts of Star Trek and disgusting the other half. <br /> <br /> Enterprise has fallen short, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" made me seriously question why I bothered to attend the shows on Monday night at Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> Masking some idea that it is one of those 'A Episodes of the Day in life, in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids, the writers seemed to forget that they were supposed to that it was a spaceship, not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people had been previously offended by the Enterprise team (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. As an animal lover, I would never have taken one of my pets to an environment that in the past had proven to be tense. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem of all of these ST shows, which consistently represent sacred and insulting things to other cultures, as they offer a glimpse of American religious fanatics. <br /> <br /> The aliens were offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, however, the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog to pee as an insult. <br /> <br /> It was strange that the dog urinating was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how one of the writers of the show got it. <br /> <br /> From there, we are subject to a captain who was wrong about his duties. Seeing the episode, it was very easy for me to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the captain of the ship. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in the infirmary and from there they give us more behavioral follies (sigh) that we are not supposed to understand and that makes us frown. <br /> <br /> The doctor cuts his long hairy nails in a non-heated way and feeds them to hungry animals in cages. Ewwwwww! Then, a white bat creature escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh, how someone is supposed to sleep with all this happening! Trimming toenails, to scream out loud! I was waiting for something to appear that feeds on vomit. <br /> <br /> Then, inexplicably, they gave us an idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that maybe he was hiding those feelings with his concern. about the dog. <br /> <br /> Endless amounts of garbage. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go and have sex, you'll feel better." And, of course, the captain had to apologize and we, the humans, had to consider his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are very (very smiling sarcastically) narrow-minded. He saw representations such as those mentioned without ceasing in TNG. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the only thing missing in this horrible episode was that the person on the trip offered their smiles and their little boyhmings, although Bakula seemed to be covering all of that. with the silly dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog survived, so now go play.
