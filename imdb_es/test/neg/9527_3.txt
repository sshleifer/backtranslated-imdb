The story, as I understand it, is "based on real events". That can be good or bad, depending on what type of license is taken with those real events and how they are processed. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to muzzle a worm. I did not expect him to come in too much, anticipating the story of rich high school kids cruising the ocean in a stern pattern. I mean, what I calculated was a coming-of-age movie about something related to the training camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, "My duty is to get you out of your civilian ways." Well, that's it, in a way. Children begin as children and end up as an organic group. But this is much weirder than any boot camp movie I've seen, other than a deliberate comedy. Who WROTE this thing? The air is full of slogans that belong, not in high school, but in third grade. The dialogue offends the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does a better job than the average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. It does not bring anything extra to the party, although given its lines, it is difficult to know how it could do much with them. The rest of the cast is not distinguished and some of the children are painfully inadequate. There is much tearing and considerable weeping. The best scene is a dolphin. <br /> <br /> The immature clich√©s continue until the end. The Coast Guard has the role of the heart court in the hearing that follows the disaster. The interrogator does nothing more than hit Bridges in the head with his misinterpretations and misinterpretation of the facts. "You let the crew drink alcohol, right?" (A couple of harmless drinks). "And you did not punish them, although you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the sinking are murky. What is a "white burst" anyway? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges says, why was not the entire crew alerted and life jackets worn? But why continue? If "The Albatross" was a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous script of a comic.
