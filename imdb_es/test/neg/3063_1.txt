Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films like "Black Widow," which had some appeal and critical acclaim. Boy, she really should have needed a rent check when she signed up to make this dog. <br /> <br /> Yes, there will be those who like gratuitous violence and nudity. But one must sit back and ask, in retrospect, what someone possessed to spend money and time to do this in the first place. I just saw this movie on one of the "HBOs," and I can not believe they picked it up. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Ms. Russell did not have the physical attractiveness that she had before in her career. . But we go! Having her play Ma Barker? His "children" all seem to be his brothers. It's also scary because you think incestuous relationships are going to happen (thank God, it's not like that, I hope that does not count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano incorporated into the cast, this is a B-series movie "directly to the video". <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, either in person or by phone, are a primer on terrible, terrible performance. Oh, wait, I also forgot the terrible, terrible writing. Chalk this up to experience. A bad experience.
