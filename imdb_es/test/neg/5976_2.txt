Movies like this give independent films a bad name! This is simply a boring compilation of vingettes, without any structure. I would not be surprised if the writer was completely drugged. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, look at "Half Baked." He has not won any awards, but at least he made me laugh. The movie was obviously made in a micro-budget. Each scene takes place in someone's house, in someone's apartment or somewhere outdoors. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the budget of the film (as in the case of the Edward Burns films), but this time it is not the case. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "A Bronx Tale" when I say: "There is nothing in the world worse than lost talent". Everyone in the cast has talent. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto, all talented artists! And everyone has been in much better movies. The actors give everything, but they could not go too far with such an unconvincing script. The only scene that I found interesting was the cameo by Jack Black, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And, of course, at the beginning there was a short strip club scene, which I also found attractive. <br /> <br /> The characters are not interesting and the story hardly exists. Many movies are horrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intention of "Bongwater"? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
