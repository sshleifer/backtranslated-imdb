This program is not, in my opinion, good, once again, I have not enjoyed any caricature of Disney Channel. Except "The proud family" because that's what it is about a normal teenager. This show is very similar to what I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to turn the film into a caricature because the film was excellent, the cartoon is terrible. Disney Channel was doing well before adding all these stupid cartoons like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, the American Dragon Jake, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they had come to PlayHouse Disney! As for this particular show, Kuzko will never leave school, as Dave The Barbarian's parents will never come home, and like Brandy And Mr. Whiskers they will never come out of the jungle.
