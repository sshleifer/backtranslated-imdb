I love watching Steven Seagal movies, not because of the action of the big holes in the plot, but because it makes me laugh <br /> <br /> Oh, it makes me laugh so much that this movie does not make any sense and it's ridiculous Comparison with this Pearl Harbor movie rocks! and Ben Affleck does not need any acting school just to give an impression of how bad it is <br /> <br /> First of all, there are so many nonsense and bad performances that just get worse, like when Steven is trying to get out of jail a helicopter lands at the beginning of the security warning and they were taken ashore when they suddenly fly off, a guard starts firing or <br /> <br /> when he killed that guy in the car, he and the two they march, you can When you do not see any oil on the ground behind it, you will notice that there is oil without even seeing a lock of junk and the car explodes <br /> <br /> and there are many more fools that Steven uses his basic action When someone is pointing a gun at him, he grabs him and shoots him totally shit! As if a gangster let that happen. <br /> <br /> the acting is also worse in the scene of the fight in prison. In the open-air place, you can clearly see Steven waiting to get into action, he just steps back a couple of times and notices the bad performance <br /> <br /> it's just that he makes me laugh, I hope that one day he will get to cinema here in Holland and then I'll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh until I die.
