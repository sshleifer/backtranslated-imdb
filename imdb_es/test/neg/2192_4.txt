A lot of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, many beautiful sets. I do not think that the plot will support such a vast expense. The story could have been told much more effectively and more valid psychologically if there was not so much macho bombing in production. Chinese movies tend to be like that, in my experience. And I think this detracts from the movie.
