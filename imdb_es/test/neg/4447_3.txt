Seriously, all these Satan movies that come to Earth always involve Catholics. Why Lucifer does not mess with the other denominations? <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but not always a demon) by leaving this young woman who is his sister pregnant with his son. Except that maybe she is not his sister. The plot is not clear on this, and intermingle in these scenes where you are shrinking your problem. <br /> <br /> The leading girl becomes pregnant when she is still a virgin, with an incredibly spooky scene of her father who did a gynecological exam to prove that her hymen is still intact ... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (interpreted by a wash and looking a lot worse because of Denise Crosby's wear) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise! <br /> <br /> Well, the demonic baby takes Mom's body for a walk of joy and dismisses, in order, a trucker, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all observed by a former military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who is managing the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is quite incomprehensible, and if you can get that far, you have a stronger stomach than the one I had. . (I paused the movie a couple of times, it was so horrible).
