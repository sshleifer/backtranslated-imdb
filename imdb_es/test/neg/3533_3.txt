A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong. The creators are trapped in a remote desert, persecuted relentlessly and without pity for their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster, is called to the outpost to help undo the horror that now hides somewhere in the dark corridors. James, along with his son and daughter, soon find themselves trapped inside with others, trying desperately to survive. And with the outpost sealed from within, there is no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unoriginal. The sets are quite claustrophobic and there is a bit of gore. However, like a horror, it fails miserably on almost every level. There is no suspense, the script is weak and full of big holes and the ending is extremely predictable. The so-called teacher Wes Craven produced this. I wonder if he's happy with this garbage. Joe Gayton runs without any style. The acting is horrible, only Lance H enriksen can act at all. Well, I'm a big fan of horror and I was disappointed bitterly. Avoid it like the plague: it's the same old boring shit again!
