This movie is like so many biographical television movies that I've seen: formulas, exaggerations, bad performances and, most importantly, happening too soon. <br /> <br /> What I mean by this is that the film was filmed and, for that matter, it was issued before Michael Jackson's acquittal of his charges of child abuse, which I think was one of the periods most significant of Jackson's life and career so far. I would probably have made a great end to this docu-drama. However, this film has already eaten more than it can chew, with too many details in this project too ambitious. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has led the most interesting life so far of all musicians, not to mention the pop star of today, to date, and his story would probably take Six specials from Behind The Music to count accurately. This movie tried to tell too much in three hours, and it goes without saying that it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did what he could while playing Jackson, but he came out as a cartoon of the SNL by people like Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. I would admit that it would be quite difficult to find someone who portrays Jackson accurately without meeting the King of Pop and studying his methods of madness. However, with a very small budget, you can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson is completely dumb. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes it look more like a show of reverse minstrels, and everyone who has been to a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's nose. It is also surprising to me that the film documents Jackson undergoing surgery to undergo a facelift, but in the next scene, Alexander still has a nose of the same size. This kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can not stand viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more annoying when the images of the real Michael Jackson (that is, the time he hung up his Un newborn child on a balcony in Germany) was interspersed in the film in real time. It was a good attempt, but it just did not work. <br /> <br /> If this movie, as it is, premiered in theaters, it would benefit only because of its insensitivity. It even pales in comparison to "Mommie Dearest", and that's saying a lot. Above all, this was a movie that he probably rushed to do, like many television movies that are not on HBO. It could have done much better if he had just talked about one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it only covered the allegations of child abuse, it probably would have done much better and even been more intriguing.
