I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this movie. I found it boring, as much as I liked looking at Penelope Cruz, and the details of the plot were often poorly crafted. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if gender roles were reversed, almost everyone who has any meaning will stand up and complain that the film is intensely misogynistic. It is not only that the main men are portrayed as complete spasms and sexual predators, but that the women are portrayed as almost impeccable, forming a utopian community that lacks conflicts of any kind and that is based on implacable generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously boring and this is no exception. But it is also interesting to note what happens (and here comes the draw of the plot, although it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) His mother rushes to take responsibility for it and (2) the daughter seems not to suffer remorse (and in fact her emotional life disappears from the movie). It is not a glorified murder, although Aldomovar's chamber persists in the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as if it were an attractive painting, and then it is absorbed and lost sight of without bleeding the daughter or the mother, nor material neither emotionally. Later, the film reveals another murder, again by a woman of a man, and once again it is a murder that the film implicitly supports. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and indeed disgusting ideology, and that is why I write an ideological critique. But other than that, it's not very interesting. It has nothing of the depth of, for example, Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.
