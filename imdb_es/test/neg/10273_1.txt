I am relieved that later reviews have soured: as I read all the positive comments, I was beginning to worry that my understanding of the movies (and life) was completely different from that of others in the world. Everything in this movie sounded false ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny narration, all that. As each scene developed, I kept thinking: "People do not act like that." It is relentlessly heavy handed and maudlin. In a way, I think the movie harasses him so that he likes it, or pretends that he likes it, because it is serious and deals with real people and faces problems. But man, it really did not work for me.
