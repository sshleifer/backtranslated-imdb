But without a doubt, a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this cheap DVD, with Sandra Bullock as the owner of the case. This is false advertising: it's on the screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other point of sale for this film: the dialogue was horrible, the edition apparently was made by someone who had put in Quaaludes, the address was ... well, let's say that my 14-year-old daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees me so weakly praised. It is possible that the family cat has done better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does a job worthy of credit for a first movie, in the short time that is on the screen, and that is the only quality that redeems this movie. A stupid story, poorly written, and transferred to the movie as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is nonsense.
