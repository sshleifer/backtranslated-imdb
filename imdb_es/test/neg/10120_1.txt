This movie is really that bad, and I'm usually an imbecile for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing in pure SUCK. Now, you may think that you have seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have seen all the titles of Full Moon and Troma, all the films of Edward D. Wood Jr., Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and directly to DVD movies of discolored action men. You may have even seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a variety of movies that covered MST3K, but in its original form. But you do not know how to make really horrible movies until you've seen Darkhunters. And if you have not done it, you should not. Do not bother This movie is not only surprisingly poorly written, directed, filmed, edited, acted on and splashed on raw and cheap side effects. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But it's not good, the Greenaway or Lynch style is pretentiously or hilariously messy in a fashionable style of Ittenbach or Waters. It's the kind of pretense that arises when someone incredibly stupid thinks he has come up with something incredibly smart. Something like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only that the man seems an incredible messiah compared to this railway junction (and this comes from a fan of Shaymalan). It is also boring. It's not boringly heavy, which is fine, if the movie gives you patience. Dark hunters do not do such a thing. It's boring in an "Oh my fu (king God), if I see another picture of a cat with an unpleasant audio signal, I'll fu (the king kills himself!", Something like that. <br /> < By the way, anyone who says he likes this movie is a daring liar, and whoever claims that this movie is complex or deep knows how his mother is in bed.
