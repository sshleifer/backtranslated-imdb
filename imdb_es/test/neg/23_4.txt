When people say that children are annoying, you think that my little cousins ​​can be annoying and I said SMALL. These children turn 10 and are, without a doubt, the most annoying spoiled children I have ever encountered (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a little bitch, I mean she's wearing miniskirts, she has curly blond hair and the face of a red bunny. She acts so innocent. Then we have the second son, the Geek, who thinks he's great, with his long-distance shots and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and, above all, his evil smile. The next child is the one you do not care about, that's all about him. This movie angered me because of the intelligence of the children and the only enjoyment I got was from my cousin, who complained about them.
