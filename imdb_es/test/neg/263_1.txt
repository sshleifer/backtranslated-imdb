This is officially the terrible, boring, corny and ridiculous movie that has ever been created. The film is about a crazy boy and his friends, and they get a 747. Their dreams are very small and do not make any sense, and they are very badly made. Each special effect seems to have been made without any modern technology, and could have been created by the child who plays the "lead role" in the film. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you more stupid. I advise you never consider watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and do not miss the brain cells that you killed. My comment does not even fully understand the terrible creation of hell that has been done. The person who wrote the comment before me did not see the same movie that I scared, and I wish I had never seen it. Peace.
