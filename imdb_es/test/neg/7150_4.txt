Everything this film tried to do is better, and excellently in "Run Lola Run". The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the critical deadlines, The Lover in danger and the message "Crime Pays-Sometimes". BUT, unlike "Lola," it is simply not credible or well organized. It is a laborious contempt that could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola", but it pales in comparison. Yes! The falling beetle was nice! But that was the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and go to Real McCoy - (and to the REAL Red Head fashion!) - in Run Lola Run!
