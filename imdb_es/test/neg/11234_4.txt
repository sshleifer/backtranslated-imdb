"A lot of the movies I've done probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have many old values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this movie is a loose remake of "A Guy Named Joe", it is also based on "A Matter of Life and Death "and" Wings of Desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg has often said that he wants to make a "Frank Capra movie" in the line of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs. Smith Goes To Washington". Judging by his recent attempts to take off the remake of "Harvey", it seems that Spielberg still has this dream, the director, rightly so, is not satisfied with his last 3 adventures in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics of the time criticized "Always", claiming that elaborate action sequences distract from the romance of the film, but that is not the problem at all. The problem is that "Always" needs many more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can not shoot any line of dialogue that does not end in an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is full of comedy that just does not work. The likes of Spielberg's comedy are not very sophisticated, and seem to have been ripped from the roll games of the fifties and the Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics can work in a universe of cartoons, but in a movie it seems a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The film's leading couple is presented as brother and sister, not as lovers. Spielberg's films have always been apprehensive about sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extremes: she is a tomboy of curiosity and he is an old man of curiosity. They are more irritating than attractive. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains a good scene, in which John Goodman discusses with Holly Hunter, but for the most part the characters in the film are too annoying. There is no subtlety, all emotions were superimposed, all jokes were designed, each sequence was filled with unnecessary occupations. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to trick audiences. After his failure (and the financial failures of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun"), Spielberg abandoned the ridiculous color photography of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the most desaturated " blacks and the "white worlds" of the "Schindler List", "Munich", "Report of Minorities" and "Saving Private Ryan." Henceforth, "less light" and "dark cinematography" were equated with " serious issues ". <br /> <br /> 9. After the financial success of each" dark film ", Spielberg returns to his color cinematography and falls back on his face." Friendship "followed" Schindler's List "," AI "followed" Ryan "and" Lincoln "to" Munich. "These" color "movies are always criticized for being too sticky, sentimental, cheesy and hokey, but the truth is that, if you eliminated the desaturation, all these movies "serious" would feel the same way. <br /> <br /> 10. Since the 70s, Spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the o other directors of brats (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.), pretending to be an "optimist" and a "humanist". He himself would affirm it repeatedly during many interviews at the end of the 70s. However, the reality is that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films that often undermine their content, his box office presentations always proportional to their dazzling displays of killings. <br /> <br /> 11. The fact that Spielberg has not connected with any of the characters of "Siempre", and the taste that shows, on the contrary, to film forest fires, plane crashes, etc., it perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People that run from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks, etc ... this is what Spielberg delights. The moment his characters stop talking, everything destroys itself. A film like "Amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites spoke. <br /> <br /> 12. The flying scenes of the film are not up to the standards established several years before in the mega hit "Top Gun". Of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it is difficult to make things cinematographic. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures like "1941", "Hook", "Always", etc. they are often more enlightening than Spielberg's most successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show what the ride at the amusement park looks like when it does not work, revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery. <br /> <br /> 5/10? Here is a good sequence (two actors in a room, just improvising), but this is mostly an annoying image with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
