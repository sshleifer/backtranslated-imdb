MELTDOWN is quite interesting SCI-FI. There is no important budget, very few special effects; but a decent performance and a history of global doom are enough to sustain visualization. An asteroid grazes the atmosphere and pushes the Earth into an orbit closer to the sun. Global warming quickly becomes unbearable. A certain police of LAPD (Casper Van Dien) does everything possible to save the world from certain annihilation, as the rising temperatures are devastating. The pressure is on saving humanity from this solar catastrophe; as well as protect your daughter, nurse ex-wife and television journalist girlfriend. The cast includes Stefanie Von Pfetten, Venus Terzo, Amanda Crew and Vincent Gale.
