Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to assume the role of "president" and then make him act like James Bond, running with a gun and entering a warehouse to discover a plot to kill Christians. , and then being able to escape from the alleged high security installation to live another day, does not do it justice: this movie has so many unsolved problems <br /> <br /> I will try to list some: <br /> <br /> 1 - What was the purpose of "accumulating" a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "strength of the tribulation" already had Vaccine available. Later, Buck Williams' wife will be with the sick preacher and she will get sick herself; So, was the virus, therefore, contagious? - If it was contagious, why did Ray and his wife go to church without adequate protection? - Why did not they get sick too? - and when Chloe drank the wine and "healed", how did she suddenly know that the wine was the "antidote"? - Was it California wine, ordinary red table wine? - could Red Grape Juice be suitable - and, if the preacher had received "communion" at least every time he preached, perhaps he would have had an antidote flowing through his body? - Buck and Chloe received a "heavy" vaccine box that was never used. What mysterious message should we see in that? <br /> <br /> 2 - the presentation of the "evil" forces that are working with the Anti-Christ Nicolai to destroy the world, since it is Russian, Chinese, etc., is really a relic of the 50s and principles. The era of James Bond, and shows an ignorance of modern society and humanity, should we believe that the Russians and the Chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet? - And for what Purpose, mere Destruction? - This was such a narrow view of this world and it was so clich√© that it could be laughable <br /> <br /> 3 - The main purpose of this film was the scene near the end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. are proselytizing among the non-believers of the audience (by showing Kirk doing proselytizing to Lou): it was a film without a meaningful story, too many disconnections with reality and a completely inappropriate argument for a great actor <br /> <br /> Therefore, I classify this as 1, since Zero is not available
