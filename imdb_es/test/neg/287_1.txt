I thought it was a comedy! What a flash! I can not believe that Forsythe or Reynolds really showed up on this piece of trash ... And then there's the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this sweet-eyed piece is called ... It seems that she gained a few pounds from her Playboy homepage. .. I like it around 50 !! The line of the story is ridiculous, the performance is absolutely horrible, and the old tired clich√©s that are repeated over and over again, boy, I had a hard time sitting through this dog ... The only thing that was worth Pity were the LAUGHTERS !! And there are MANY! If you really want to kill, say, an hour and a half pick up this baby in the rental store, but make sure you have a room full of people brain dead to see it with you. I think that was written for that ... play as if they were thinking of a really low audience, induced by drugs for this ...
