iCarly is about a teenager named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, Spencer in a loft in Seattle. Carly has a web program that gets millions of visits and generates tons of money a year, so much money that "she does not even know it's a real number". Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy) who is as predictable as they come! She says "normal" things and hits Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is in charge of all the technical things for his web program. Carly screams every word and seems to have no emotion. Sam chases Freddie and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the doorman) in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this at all, unless you like teens who scream, hurt people and make fun of everything.
