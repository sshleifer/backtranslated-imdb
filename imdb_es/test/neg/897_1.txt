A long time ago, in the early 80's, a nightly television program "Fridays" came to ABC, trying to steal the spotlight on NBC's "Saturday Night Live". He did not do it but he introduced some disgusting sketches and semi-talented "comedians" in the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> What, indirectly, brings us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... Together again". Which is disgusting in its own way. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is as subtle as a bank full of Whoopee cushions that are removed after Communion. And almost as good taste, too. This is just his junkie junkie character who played in the unfortunate program of the "Fridays" extended to the length of the feature film. And if you did not like it there, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Each time more than one or two writers are needed to write a movie, it's a bad sign. Then, when it comes to shoddy jokes that will get you out of all stages of improvisation in the Western Hemisphere and replace the gags for disgusting, things can only get worse. The story of Louis Stevenson? An idea as good as making a comedy from the "Fall of the House of Usher" by Poe. <br /> <br /> Apart from some (VERY few) gags that give a slight smile, this whole movie is an exercise in wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> No wonder they showed the original author Stevenson spinning in his grave. What more observant observation could they give themselves? <br /> <br /> Without stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" of this.
