In case the title has not revealed it, this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> Short review? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to include in the script. I doubt it is published considering how badly I wrote everything, but if this is the case and someone reads it, stick to appreciate the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every way. The sequels are never worth buying or seeing, and everyone involved in doing them should be ashamed to have ruined what has to be one of the most classic and original films of our childhood.
