Seriously! You just have to watch this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It emerged during the period of time when everyone tried to make family films that everyone could enjoy (The Little Rascals, Mr. Nanny, etc.), however, lacked charisma or enthusiasm. All the characters in the film are motivated by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows aggravation and fatigue, possibly in the tired clich√© that this film enjoys. <br /> <br /> In short, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, not the filming, but the writing. The lines we receive remind us of the Disney classics, although this film lacks all the enthusiasm that IL 'Walt managed to achieve. Junior's father, (John Ritter) annoys you without even doing anything, simply because it allows Junior to run unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when he shoots a 200-pound giant on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> In addition, Junior's grandfather is particularly unbearable. For those of you who saw the first, they found it nauseating, and therefore, they did not see the second one, "Big Ben Healy," as it is mentioned in this movie, is still complete nonsense. Basically, he bursts into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles into Junior's room, even though he says he hates Junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the speed of the movie, or to support the movie. some way. Rather, it ticks the audience for being a lazy loader. <br /> <br /> Finally, they present us with a great variety of new characters, such as the petulant and detestable Trixie, who carries dynamite in his backpack. , what first illuminates, then hands, to Junior, who simply looks with wide eyes. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the nasty director of Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to convey the message, I will put it simply: this movie stinks! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actor's convictions shine through the film, although the script stinks.
