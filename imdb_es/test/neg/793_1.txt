The first time I felt I needed to write a review. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide variety of movies. I have a reasonably open mind, and I can easily say that I enjoyed a movie while still saying "yes, it was not good, but I enjoyed it". I can appreciate the dominance of great movies like The Shaw Shank Redemption, The Godfather and American History X. I can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, even if the movie is not so good. I can even enjoy a bad movie that I enjoy (Bloodsport). I will also try to rate the film fairly, even if I do not like it. City Lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie that I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the lines of action and history of the time. <br /> <br /> I think some people when they enter this site instead of randomly clicking on a ranking, should consider some ideas. Try to rate the movie based on how good it really was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other movements that you have rated and compare the movie you are going to rate. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst piece of garbage I've seen in my life. 2 hours of my life where he just stole. The performance was horrible, in all areas. The scenes where choppy at best. However, the real misfortune was the story. The first 20 minutes we had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to point B. However, after that it was a nightmare. They continued trying to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, the butler was dead, if he was alive, if he hit him with enlightenment, if he was really lighting him, if he was extraterrestrial, if he is an extraterrestrial, etc. The only positive thing was that nobody cared that we were happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What is wrong with some of you? I admit that all 8 of us were so angry to see this, we thought "what would make it better?", And we decided to tell some of our friends that this movie was good for them to suffer and watch this movie. What can I say about the misery that the company loves? That is really the only reason why I can see a rating of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your life!
