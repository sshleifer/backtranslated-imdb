Why redo the original "Assault"? In my opinion, "Assault" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements that contain the good films of Carpenter. External threat in a small group of individuals. People who take the challenge because they are forced to do it. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter's original did not sound, so they are much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on the psychology of the "main character I" and his relationship with the main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the movie Carpenter was replaced by a fairly conventional conspiracy / corruption fund. The "remakers" simply did not understand the main plot of the original. And so something quite ordinary happened.
