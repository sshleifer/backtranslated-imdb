In addition to all the negative reviews: I was surprised to see that in the blink of an eye somewhere, somehow a CCTV camera was summoned in a more unlikely location, to show the 'crisis' team ('' Mira Maaaaa -aaam '') what was happening, especially near the Thames barrier, where a teacher is hit with the maximum force (wind) against the head by a heavy object and then lives to tell the story. Otherwise, I could not remove the image of some actors as shown in other films / programs: I said to my wife: 'Hey, that's Neil, from the Youth' (Nigel Planer) and 'Did you call Hercule Poirot for help ? '(David Suchet). To add to the misfortune of this movie (shown in two parts at ITV UK recently), ITV showed the phone number of the Environment Agency after each episode for concerned viewers, who live in areas' at risk of flood'. How low can you, as an announcer, treat your audience that way? What should the Environment Agency have thought? ('' Oh no, it's Mrs. Jones of Hull again, she says she was right all the time, she saw it on ITV '').
