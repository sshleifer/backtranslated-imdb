I've seen this movie recently, mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw that this film was made between his two Oscar-winning performances, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I still wonder how she was convinced to make this movie. The script is very weak. The story itself may have been something credible if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of hit man. The idea of ​​Jodie escaping with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me. I thought Jodie looked very good throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason I saw it all. Maybe the only reason the film was made was to parade Jodie with as little clothes as possible. I saw a TV biography of Jodie where basically all her films were commented in chronological order, and this movie was the only one that was never mentioned. After seeing it, now I can see why.
