This movie was only on two nights running on ITV1 ... dear oh dear. Someone really bought this with the strength of Robert Carlylse ... Okay, I missed the beginning ... but what I saw was so bad that I thought, no ... I saw with shame the stars that were in it. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt that things will progress as they did in this movie. Everything was poor in this movie. Ok, cgi ... but there is no reality. The writing gave the impression of a cliff suspension end ... I'm sorry, it did not impress me. Yes, formulaic. The end could not be guessed. So I saw that the military had an advantage, people who did heroic things were given almost no time to do their thing, would not it have happened like that? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was annoying ... as someone else said ... yes, of course ... of course it would have happened ... no! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada ... so it was a co-production, we miss the third one in question ... I'll have to check again on this site. Normally I'm not that critical, but this bothered me.
