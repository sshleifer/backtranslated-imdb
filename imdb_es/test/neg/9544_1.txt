I would not recommend it to anyone, except movie fans who like to laugh at a movie, not with it. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty promising premise and the set of actors gets progressively worse with a movie that ends with Perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a movie. I will not spoil it, but basically the most used set of movie clich√©s is done poorly and with little enthusiasm during the last five disappointing minutes of any movie. <br /> <br /> The film also includes The most inducing scene in history, the chemistry attempt on screen between the two main roles when we are presented with a close-up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger with love . It may be the only thing that can move, but that's why the viewer is treated with a zoom of Washington's finger to be caressed in the middle of the kind of dim lights and the right music for a sex scene surpasses me. I laughed out loud and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the story is largely inspired by Se7en, but here it is executed much more simplistically and too obviously. Call it a poor man-Se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a movie made for television, and even the best efforts of Jolie and Washington can not convince this of a box office movie.
