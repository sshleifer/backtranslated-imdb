Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again, while her traveling painter father pursues his next landscape. Fifteen years old, he is in his rebellious stage. Already angry with her father for her frequent relocations, her anger is compounded when her mother is suddenly confined to a tuberculosis sanatorium. The absence of his mother causes Tamara to assault her father and seek solace in the religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in his rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest by default. It has a strange rhythm, and even during its emotional scenes there is no tension. The actors that portray the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the mother of the dead teenager in whom she feels guilty. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateur to carry the movie. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can not achieve it. She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good, but there were too many times when she felt uncomfortable. You can see your thinking "well, this is what my line is and this is the face I'm supposed to do" instead of actually reacting to the other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also suffer forced deliveries, but at least they are in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done well, the script could have turned it into a movie that affects. And he has it in moments, but a lot of him is stuck with an amateur leadership performance and a flat direction.
