TANDEM is a strange piece in the Japanese pink genre, since it has the sex scenes and the misogynistic tone necessary for this kind of movies, but it also presents a disconnected dark comedy / drama story that seems to have been more suitable for a different type of movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two lonely guys in a restaurant, each dreaming of a previous sexual encounter. One of them is a mutual search for subway, the other a quite typical scenario (for this type of film) of semi-violation. The two perverts meet and begin to talk after one gives the other a cigarette. They go out one night and talk a little about their respective sexual lives. The film is interconnected with flashbacks of the interactions of both men with the women who are central to their lives. The two men fight and the film ends with a strange but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really do not know what to do with TANDEM. It seems that it is a kind of anti-movie type "strange pair", but that does not really explore the subject to any satisfactory degree. Nor is there much of the typical extreme sleaze so prevalent in this type of film, so I really can not understand what it is about. Nor can I say with certainty if the movie should be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a margin of dark comedy, but like a soft-core sex movie that tries to be too "smart" for its own sake, it just does not work. I can not say I hated this, but I can not say there is anything remarkable about it either. 4/10
