Just a few words: it is good that George A Romero is still among us because if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from the grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire'. And the saddest thing of all is that I actually agree with the feelings of these people. Yes, there are zombies in him and they have a good reason to return from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them ends with The Doctor of Startrek Voyager. That's all that scares people. If you're looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for an ingenious political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called Masters of Horror. But do not let me hold you back: maybe you'll see something that I missed. Although most likely, you waste your time with him, just like me. Let's say I prefer my zombie movies with the zombies that are standing in front of the camera.
