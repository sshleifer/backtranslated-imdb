Herschell Gordon Lewis, low budget, reaches a new low level (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (snicker) that has all its technical brands: poorly recorded sound, low illumination and gore OTT. This would be tolerable, even a bit charming, if the movie at least had an interesting plot ("Blood Feast", in all its ridiculous glory, is a good example), but "Girls" is a complete nap. A newspaper reporter recruited pompous-ass private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) to find out who has been killing the strippers out of shape (he will stop worrying about who is to blame long before these two are finishing the case) . As before, the appeal is not the plot, but the creative methods of bloodshed (including the removal of a girl with a wooden mallet) and occasional flashes of daring skin ... but this is not enough to elevate the material above boredom.
