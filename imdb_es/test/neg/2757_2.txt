This could have been much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman performs well and some of the older actors perform well with what they have to work on, but it just does not work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are too old to play in high school students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). It seems about thirty. Second, it's hard to sympathize with poor Marv, especially because Betty is not that good to begin with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The ending is so strange. It seems that the director intended Pittman's character to be shot, but there are no shots ... he just hit the cement, where he remains there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher ( upside down!). What were your wounds? A bare knee? Goofy! Vince has just killed his girlfriend without remorse, however, he simply pushes Marv to the ground and runs off, even though he does not hide the fact that he hates the boy. And to make things even stupider, Marv begs the police to tell his father he's sorry. (Duh, Hi, Marv, they just hit you, I think you'll have many opportunities to tell your father that you're sorry ... in person). And this writer did not get an Oscar nomination? Skip, unless you can see it in MST.
