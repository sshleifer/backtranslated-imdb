Some movies you will see because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. <br /> <br /> Some you will see because you want to be exposed to the adventure or the shock outside of your experience; they will not feed you directly, but they will help you to find yourself in a larger world than you would otherwise have had. And after all, the difficult parts of life are what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are movies that do not do any of these things, which you will see as an obligation or because you have. A need for historical context. These are pretty useless experiences in terms of building a life. <br /> <br /> The problem is, of course, that you often do not know which of the three will be a movie when you enter. It is possible that you get some indication of people you trust, but since life in the movies is so personal, you will not know until you go to the blind date. <br /> <br /> For me, this was pretty useless. Yes, yes, I know that for many Bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. And you should know (if you do not) that among my best cinematographic experiences there are some very strange, very strange movies. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is not cinematically or symbolically profound. Or apolitically / politically friendly to the way I think. It's how it gets there that is off base. It is the deviation from the actual deviation that bothers me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that this is a successful alternative art, which means it is a successful commercial art. Which in turn means that it can be explained in a simple way and that the explanation is not only widely acceptable, but simply encoded in shorthand. Surely all this is true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surrealistic" is used, it is usually incorrectly used to denote any movie or world image that differs from reality or that seems strange. But when used correctly, that is, according to the theory of consensus, it always revolves around Bunuel, and in particular to this film and the one he really did with Dali. Then because they invented surrealist cinema, they define and control the term. That alone irritates me, and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from his philosophy. <br /> <br /> It's because the philosophy is totally contrary. It is not a philosophy at all, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Their anarchy is packaged, carefully selecting the things they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them. <br /> <br /> Very well: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (easy), against deliberate love But for a lineal linear narrative, to establish its own history (celebrated by countless teachers from the film school, what else can you do?); for a kind of transcendent "accidental" love. <br /> <br /> It's your own enemy. If there were a Bunuel alive today while selling his image, the first thing he would do would be to attack the church or the surrealist. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that in almost all cinematographic matters, I joined the Spanish and avoided the French. But on the subject of the surreal, I would like you to consider the opposite: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not from Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 2 of 3: has some interesting elements.
