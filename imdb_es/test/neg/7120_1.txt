All I can say about this movie is that it's absolutely boring. The introduction to the movie is possibly the worst introduction to a horror movie I've seen, I mean an angry girl who hits a guy in the head with a pan is not terrifying at all, which is what I guess the Director was aiming for, but in reality it was "slightly" fun. <br /> <br /> The acting in this photo was more than pathetic; A note to the directors, if you're making a horror movie, hire some good actors, not some popular soap star who has no idea how to act. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death in this movie were more than boring. .. no gore, and I'm sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just corny. I mean that this girl is killed by the hair that surrounds her in the middle of Tokyo, and no one sees it happen, they simply declare her "disappeared", wow, that's incredible! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring some sleeping pills, because I guarantee you will not get to the end. My friend and I left because we did not even care what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Regards
