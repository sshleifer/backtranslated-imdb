I usually love finding old westerns (and some not so old ones) that I have not seen, to be the evening's entertainment. It is an excellent way to sit down, relax and escape from politics and world problems for a few hours. But this was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The cast and plot of this series follow closely the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; ancient history, correct, revisionist, where all the "bad" must be white, men, Confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if somehow it can be included in the script) It is sad, really. The best films that exist are now and always have been about simply telling a good story on the big screen, not about forwarding someone's political ideology.
