Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The acting was terrible and even the plot was ridiculous. I gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I like to laugh at incredibly cheesy movies. For starters, my expectations were not high, but it turned out to be much more complicated than I expected. I thought I might not be so bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition, The Golden Whisk, came up, I started to change my mind. Everything went downhill from there. The only thing I liked about this movie, besides making fun of its absurd plot and dialogue, was watching them cook. However, being a film about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they really cooked anything. I would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. You can see more food being prepared and you avoid the pathetic ones of a single line. However, if you like corny love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and look.
