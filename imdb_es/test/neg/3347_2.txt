I must, in the light of the accolades of praise for this film of the spectators, once again assume the role of the turd in the punchbowl, as Lowell Weicker used to say, I am scratching my head at the large amount of praiseworthy comments. "The African queen" this is not. The taste of the time is wonderful, yes. The acting is fine, but no actor, no matter how big, can bring life to the endless stream of a perfectly tedious and insignificant table conversation and dinner here, and I do not care how much of this is drawn from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half like a fly on the wall at a Christmas dinner of a group of people not particularly interesting (it is not clear to me that it is a family, as one person suggested), having to listen to your mundane table talk, and You have the essential experience of this movie. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said with an endless length. As I said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. Speaking of mysteries, look for a good one instead of this.
