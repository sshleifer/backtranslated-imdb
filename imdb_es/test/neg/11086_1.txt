So you have the spoiler warning, but I would say you can not spoil what is already rotten. I guess they changed the name to "The Cavern" in case the reputation of "WIthIn" had preceded it. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable rent for this movie, I considered saving my domestic garbage for a month and sending it by mail to the writer / director. They sent the trash to my house, so I thought it was fair to return the favor. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a suggestion that the scene is in the Kazakh desert. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; Maybe the writer is a fan of the Ali G Show. But they should have started inside the cave, because the outside obviously was not Kazakhstan. It was the first clue that he was going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no redeeming qualities, except one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography, all aspects of this movie are just bad. And I like bad movies, silly movies, B-horror movies. . . but this was just bad. And stupid And trite. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To familiarize yourself with the movie, go to your laundry with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Put a flashlight (lit) in your dryer and start spinning. Now all of you start screaming and screaming at the top of your lungs. That is all. <br /> <br /> For a complete recreation, have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry die on the floor. Throw the Karo syrup over them. Turn the lights back on (stop the dryer). Now have a man in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing. <br /> <br /> END <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Reading the other comments, many find it extraordinary that this movie was made on a low budget. That is not extraordinary. Making a fucking movie with a HUGE budget is extraordinary (Waterworld). Making a good movie with a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, which I enjoyed a lot). Making a shitty movie with a low budget is not a bit surprising, and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies, because I can not imagine that someone will give them a lot of money after seeing this. <br /> <br /> Is the low budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and there's certainly no reason to see it. Would you eat a dog manure sandwich just because it was cheap to make? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating for this movie over time will be interesting to watch. I should go further down, but only if the number of innocent and innocent bystanders can exceed the ability of the filmmakers to beg their personal friends to give them 10 stars.
