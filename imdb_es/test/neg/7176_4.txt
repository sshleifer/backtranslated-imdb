I admit that this is not a great movie. He practically shouts "low budget", but curiously I still like the movie because, although it lacks quality, it is full of energy. It was like the Little Engine That Could and a movie merged into one! <br /> <br /> The film is made on a radio network and concerns some of its low level employees, two guys on one page (one very aggressive and cheeky and the other a bit weird) as well as a new one receptionist. All three have visions of radio stardom, but for now they must be content with their humble jobs. <br /> <br /> In this story appears a murder that seems somewhat unexpected. I did not know that this was a murder mystery movie and it surprised me a little. However, like most B mysteries, the cops are lazy and it is up to our aggressive hero (Moran) to try to save the day. Throughout all this, it was hard for me to decide if Moran was hateful or endearing. I'm not sure yet!! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the film that occupies a prominent place in the "crisis factor" and is when the two pages try to play the roles of radio comedians. They appear in black face and make an imitation of third or fourth class of Amos n 'Andy. Apart from being very insensitive, it was not funny either. Fortunately, the producer of the program they were testing seemed to feel the same. <br /> <br /> In general. It's easy to skip this movie and I would not blame you if you did. However, the strange and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to compensate for the artistic shortcomings of the film and I'm glad I saw it. A good movie? No. But one that is still worth it for fans of the old Bs. <br /> <br /> By the way, I may not have very good taste, but I thought BOTH singer divas really had bad voices. in the film they are captivated by their distortions. Listen for yourself and let me know what you think. He just could not believe that either of them was allowed to sing in a movie, even if it was only for Monogram Studios monograms.
