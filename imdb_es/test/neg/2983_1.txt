This was without a doubt the WORST movie I've seen, but once I started, it was like the really bad car accident on the side of the road: you can not help it, you just have to look. My eyes !!! The performance was horrible, the production was horrible, the shooting was horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. I was glad that the priest had cut himself, I would have loved to have done it myself because of his bad performance. I mean the suction to the tenth power. He would have applauded if Chris had torn them apart before turning against himself. And what did he have with that damned wig of hell in his head? I sincerely hope that no one is paid, I mean that if you consider the payment here, they should be paid so that they never try another film project, everyone involved, never, never again. That was just a huge piece of trash that I'm ashamed to say that I just had to keep looking until the end. Do not see it, it's almost an hour and a half of your life that you'll never come back, and then you'll have to take time to register on this website so you can write a comment like I'm doing now, that you should do as a catharsis to survive the replicas of having seen this movie (and I use the term "movie" loosely here).
