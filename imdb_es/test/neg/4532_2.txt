This is a badly written and misdirected short film, pure and simple. What is interesting and keeps me looking, to some extent, was the production values. Taken on video, it appears, with a bad script and a bad address, one would think that it would also have a horrible production value. That's what the viewer expects when he sees a movie that is terrible and filmed on video. BUT not in this case, they spent some money and it shows. He kept me slightly interested in seeing what was coming next, just to see! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst short film I've seen that looked like Hollywood's big budget, even though it was filmed in some kind of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent on a pretty impressive set design, it would have been better to see a better story executed with a good address. But again, how can we expect the new filmmakers to do this when even Hollywood does not do it?
