This is a television series for children about Mary-Sue, which at the same time is bad and bad. I could not sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can not act to save her life! What message does this program bring to children? If you're not perfect like Zoey, you're not worthy of * Rollseyes *. <br /> <br /> It is absurd that the character of Zoey is exactly the kind of person who would be despised in real life, but manages to be so popular. Then there is Chase, who is basically a puppy in love who loves the land where Zoey walks. Then there's the fact that all the other characters seem to have been silenced to keep them from protruding from Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
