This is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life. And believe me, I've seen many movies. The incredible twist that the film makes - going from an extremely bad movie "Alien forms of life inhabits the earth" with a badly unhealthy performance, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian "The day of the final judgment is at hand, look Jesus or even though it will burn for all eternity. " The message of the debts of hell "left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes, even religious Christians should feel ashamed or angry to see their beliefs published this way." I did not know what to do with me when I saw the horrible performance that the 7-year-old children could have made, just disgusting, I'm not Christian or very religious, but if I had been, I would not be afraid of hell anymore, Rich Christiano has proved to be much, much worse.
