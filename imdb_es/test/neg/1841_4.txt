I have to disagree with people who say that this is a terrible horror movie with good acting and camera work. I would say it is a good horror movie RUINED by a surprisingly abysmal performance and a bad camera work. Look 'Ju-on: The Grudge To waste your time with this garbage. The main idea behind the film is quite original, considering the abundance of fear festivals based on killer dolls that have been imposed on us over the years; unfortunately, the story is handled with all the subtlety of the last Michael Bay action player, with a cast of characters that are unpleasant in a uniform way and are interpreted with perfect frightening accuracy by presumably selected actors of the Korean soap operas during the day. He is not afraid and only manages to stop his expectations of the next Korean horror movie. Oh good.
