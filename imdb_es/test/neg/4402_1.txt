This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class to sleep, as well as the teacher. <br /> <br /> Non-related video chains, absolutely boring and long (yes, silent). <Br /> <br /> Instead of this film, see the dry paint or the grass grow, it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing that the Arabs are malicious to everyone around you. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the Director) should be ashamed of this little waste of film. <br /> <br /> It deserves a one for the quality of the film, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack of it).
