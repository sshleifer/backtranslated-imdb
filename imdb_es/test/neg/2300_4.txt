The murder of Red Comyn in Grayfriars Abbey was far from one of the most horrific things to have been done in the Scottish War of Independence and the fights (and murders) in the churches were not unusual. Not long after, the wife, the daughter of Robert Bruces and two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people died. And compare it with the Berwick massacre in which the British killed at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, yes, in the churches) is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What is said is not a well-made movie. It is a slight antidote to the mocking depiction of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it was not weird. <br /> <br /> Too bad they have not done a better job on this because someone should do a VERY GOOD movie of a war that is so incredible that it sounds like something someone invented, going from the complete defeat at the Battle of Methven to a secret return from his hiding place to a long guerrilla war to Bannockburn. Although this is not so. It is badly done and, to a large extent, it is badly written and acted. Too!
