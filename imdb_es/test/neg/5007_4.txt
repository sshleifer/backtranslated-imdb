What is wrong with CURACAO (also known as ACTUALS MORTALES although the reason for the name change is that I have no idea) can probably be summarized where a woman says to her lover: <br /> <br /> "Keep it down baby, I'm trying to sleep "<br /> <br /> It is not the dialogue the problem or the way it is presented, it is the fact that the actress has a central European accent. Nothing wrong with that until it is revealed that his character is Philidelphia in the United States! This is what caught my attention in this thriller while I watched it: the way in which the accents do not match their characters. Apart from the Philadelphia woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who seems to be an Irishman posing as a Gestapo officer and, worst of all, George C Scott as someone who is Dutch or British with an accent. That sounds like it's an American nuance with the South African. Soon you stop following what is on screen and end up concentrating on the nationality of a character due to the strange way in which he speaks. It is interesting to note that this site has not given this film a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this was produced by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Even if you are not curious about the accents or dialects, you will probably have to give up following the action anyway because CURACAO It is a less plot. Things happen like the explosion of a boat, a hostage situation and the hero who is being recruited as an agent of South African intelligence, but you keep scratching your head wondering what the hell this is all about.
