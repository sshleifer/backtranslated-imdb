A terrible film that is amateur on almost every level: a boring and derivative script full of stereotyped characters played by ashamed actors for a director who lacks the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. All this sucks. It reproduces like a slasher movie from the early eighties, to the fucking score and the SFX ketchup, but without the nostalgia of childhood that is required to look fondly at that scum. One of the worst horror movies I've seen in my life, definitely the worst one that received a conventional theatrical release. I have never left a movie in my life; If I had the bad luck to see 'Hatchet' in the theater, it would have been the first time. Avoid at all costs.
