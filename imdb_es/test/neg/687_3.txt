I have as much testosterone as the next person, and Raquel Welch at her best is worth checking out; But the fact is that a cardboard cutout could work better, and an hour and a half of Ms. W showing her considerable resources is not a movie. <br /> <br /> Given the cast, it's amazing how bad it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is as convincing as a $ 9 bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, who I often enjoy, seem to be sleeping between their lines; and as for Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster: from a non-existent plot, through the action of stopping and starting and a non-funny script to puerile slapstick and annoying music of the 60 'caper'. If it were not for Miss Welch, I would have given her a 0. <br /> <br /> That said, it's a treat for the eyes, even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled', and for that alone I gave her a 3.
