At the beginning of 'Loggerheads', we are presented with three pairs of apparently unrelated characters. To make things even more confusing, we are informed (through the titles on the screen) that the action is carried out in three separate time lines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a long time, but in the end we get to see how the three pairs relate: Mark Austin, a 20-year-old, gay and HIV positive is separated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and the Reverend Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a vagabond and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a coastal city, where he meets George (played by Michael Kelly), owner of a gay motel and eventually get involved with each other. Meanwhile, Mark's biological mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt), has reached the point in her life when she decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17 years old. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother also decided to follow up on his estranged son when he misses him (despite the misgivings of his homophobic minister, the husband). <br /> <br /> They tell us that the 'Loggerheads' are based on a real story and that maybe it is their Achilles heel. The director / writer Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes charged with a dramatic tension where there is very little to find. Take Mark and George, both are sensitive souls who have little to disagree with. There is a bit of tension when Grace confronts a Director of the Adoption Agency who is prohibited by law from giving her information about her lost son, as well as a minor conflict with her mother who denies having disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. . Neither Elizabeth nor Robert fly sparks, since the good Reverend firmly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son. <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' is similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' in the sense that gay couples are good guys and straight men (for example, Kure Beach police and the Reverend) are the bad guys. The biggest disappointment of the film is that there is no interaction (and, therefore, no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before the biological mother or adoptive mother has the opportunity to reconcile with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both a request for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their sincere feelings before it is too late. Kirkman's feelings are for the most part well intentioned, but they do not constitute a good drama. Loggerheads advances at full speed without providing new revelations (or suspense) on issues such as AIDS, adoption and homophobia. Ultimately, 'Loggerheads' fails due to a lack of originality.
