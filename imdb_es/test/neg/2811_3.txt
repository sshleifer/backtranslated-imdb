I have not seen any other Antonioni film and the people who saw it with me agreed that it shares themes and images with the rest of their works. Maybe if I had seen other things about him, I would have enjoyed this, knowing what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as an almost complete failure for many reasons. In the first place, the film presents interesting and profound themes about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is often done in the most clumsy way to make the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling and speaking, juxtaposing statements instead of having dialogues. The writers seem to be so worried that we do not understand the point they prefer to tell instead of showing. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow films have been done with an excellent sense of rhythm (Victor Erice's South or Scorsese's Age of Innocence are examples that I like), but for this to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so attractive or the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag on endlessly, and the relationship between the "reality" of John Malkovich and the "fiction" of the love stories is sometimes fluid, sometimes abrupt and sometimes confusing.
