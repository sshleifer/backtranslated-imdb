Now I've seen two films by director Chen Kaige, a very good one (Goodbye my concubine), and it's bad, The Assassin. Both films represent crucial events in Chinese history, FMC in the 20th century and the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC triumphs with memorable characters, a magnificent cinematography, convincing scenarios, good acting and an interesting story. The Assassin fails on almost every level (well, the sets are great, the cinematography is good and the few battle scenes are quite exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you felt that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic, keep in mind that this will make you sick. Dialogue lacks life, many lines seem political statements, subtle or entertaining, this image does not. The movie is dominated by its own pomp. I'm really surprised that The Assassin has so many votes here at imdb. 4/10
