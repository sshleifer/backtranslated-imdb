I have not read this book and based on this adaptation, I will not bother. He hated all the characters in this program: Miranda was a bitch, selfish and muttered miserably through the atrocious dialogue, her sister was a total redhead, and this was the worst description of the manic depression she had seen. I have a degree in psychology, and this was not exact. In fact, until it was mentioned, I did not realize that Troy was supposed to be bipolar; I thought he was a normal teenager and slightly grumpy. <br /> <br /> The only one who saved this stupid show was David Tennant. whose brilliant psychotic performance was the only thing that made me see the second half. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the writers and producers of this program have not done any research: Troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, nor the forensic ones involved in the end of the "turn" (and if not what detected) mile away, you are a big ole mannequin!) <br /> <br /> Full garbage.
