Let me say that this new He-Man cartoon is not destroying the memories of childhood, since I did not like the old He-Man caricature either. I loved the action figures, but I thought the caricature was corny and I hated the plot (the He-Man that I liked was the one of the first pre-caricature comics included in the figure boxes, where He-Man was a barbarian, the Sword of Power was divided into two parts, and there was no Prince Adam, no premise of Shazam, and no Orko). Anyway, let's leave old things in peace. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a shame on its own, as it represents the worst taste of the old program, and the worst trends of today. I saw him because he had heard that the morale in his face of the old program had disappeared (fortunately), and this had more game development of swords and characters. But I found a horrible mixture of the worst clichés of the genre, characters that I could not help but hate, and the Matrix visual style - sadly inevitable. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give some background for the characters, since it showed a pre-peeling facial Skeletor, but that's how far the development of the character goes, apart from the usual garbage of the age that I see coming in later episodes, where teenybopper Adam will learn the responsibility of his new acquired powers, blah, blah. At least in the old show, Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself hating his insides. That's what we get when they launch an adventure program aimed at preadolescents: beautiful faces and youthful clothing with a desire to be cool. I should review the new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special appearance. Man, does this show remind me of the 1996 Stinkbomb cartoon of Flash Gordon? <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Say ah! Follow absolutely all the clichés in the book, from the goody-lil-two-shoes Randor in the opening scene to the immortal Skeletor "Oh, and He-Man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high tone as in the previous series. 20 years, and nothing that we have learned. <br /> <br /> And of course, nowadays there can not be anything related to the action other than the Matrix style. Leave the anime to the Japanese, friends, think new ideas. And seeing the positions of the characters while they fought did not help either. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell can think of this). Names?) Does not have yellow skin now, but it is gray-ish. Oh, then no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu will not appear in the show either. Shadows of the 1996 FG again, where Ming the Merciless was a green extraterrestrial, like a toad! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's lack of expression. I do not think I would have liked this more or less if Cringer spoke, he's corny enough like this. And you have your extra cheese ration with Orko! The surprising thing is that, probably, many of the people who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks, could be great Orko fans ... <br /> <br /> I watched the feature film pilot and I already had enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10
