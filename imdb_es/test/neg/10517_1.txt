Everyone knows that night films are not Oscar nominees. Penalty fee. I mean I'm going to admit that I was a little dizzy and bored and I thought I was going to have a little skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the information on the television guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. He even gave half a star. To be fair, I sat down to throw the whole thing because the man was so bad. I could not stop laughing. I mean the words that come out of these people's mouths and how they tried to be serious. Most of the time I think the people on the screen were doing everything possible to not laugh. In fact I think that in a scene they laughed. Anyway, the movie did not make sense. It was like that episode of the Sopranos with the fat gay. Only the soprano is a great show. But it was terrible, I mean, without nudity, only sex scenes from the 90's. You know the guy who uses shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. I gave him two reasons because this movie is a good movie of drinking games. I mean, with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night, and everything on the television is this and that Tony Little boy and his exercise bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
