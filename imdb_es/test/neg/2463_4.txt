"Once again, we have a movie that contains about 20 minutes of entertainment, largely with the funny lyrics of the band, in a 90-minute package." For anyone who is old enough to remember, this is a line from the first "Bill and Ted" WITHOUT the story line. If that does not say enough about how carefree this movie is, think of Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that is his point of sale. If you really like listening to Tenacious D because of your musical prowess, take some time and buy yourself the soundtrack. Although do not waste your time with this. If you are a fool in search of a good bad movie full of laughter, you are still barking the wrong tree. No matter the power of your buds, you'll still want to have reappeared in Grandma's Boy.
