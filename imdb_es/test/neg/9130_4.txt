What I expected (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" image and the extreme slow movements, the extreme zooms and all the fish eye shots that they encompass. In short: the art of a) finding interesting Visual Events and b) capturing them in a way that the human eye can not reproduce, so that the human eye can see them. The things that made the successes of the other Qatsi. <br /> <br /> I wondered how the title would fit with the creation of the set. <br /> <br /> Having seen the film, I have the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the packaging. That's fine, especially because the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and it seemed that I had nothing left. More than half of the film was solarized or colored or posterized or transformed through some other filter. It was very similar to the effects that your video camera has but you never use. Many of the images would have been prettier without the filters, like the pursuit of giraffes and zebras. You could say that 'technology or any other malicious source based on humans disfigured our beautiful nature', but why use these effects of the seventies to symbolize that? At the time when there was more than 10 minutes of this cheap looking effect, I was ready to leave. The hope that the rest could not be so bad made me stay. But then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving image. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then there is not enough movement to slow down. Please record the movement to be slower faster, as was done with the beautiful shots of foam and water splashes (some of) people laughing and soldiers singing exercise songs. I recognize that archival images can not be redone, but I had seen many of those images anyway, they could have been done without them. It must have been a lot of work to search the file archive, and the effects may not have been so easy to apply and organize as well. In addition to that, much of the work was mixed together. This shows that the creator was not willing to extend the film or save. But I did not like mixed things a bit ... The idea behind this was sometimes nice or even smart, but the implementation was insufficient. The computer generated images did not bother me much, however out of date. The 'bits' transmitted along the circuits (in the first part of the movie) seemed more recent and were pleasant. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was less. I was pleased to hear a cello play an important role in music. A little less vibrato at certain times would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but that's a matter of taste. As is all of the above, of course. I hope there is another story of Qatsi to tell soon, where the computer images have a less significant role and inspire someone to enter the field again. <br /> <br />
