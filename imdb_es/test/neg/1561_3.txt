Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (loved the sweet music of the chin on the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst matches I've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match: Why do I see them? Nobody wins a championship in the rumble, it's not the main event. I liked it when Show led JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship: a pretty good game, more like a beating of Tripe H than a match, but I was glad to see it after seeing the shit. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, I liked the brawl of the brand, the question of Hassan and the end. 7/10 In general, it's still bullshit. Why does someone see the rumor?
