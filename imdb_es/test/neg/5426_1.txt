Oh my God, this is so idiotic. Completely useless, offensive and repulsive. Why do writers have so much trouble getting Zoey and Chase together? We all love them too! In normal shows, there is actually MORE THAN ONE plot of conflict in the show, wow, what a concept. Also, you can not even differentiate the episodes of Zoey 101 from each other because the same thing always happens. Quinn blows up Dustin for a weird thing, Nicole is giggling and stupid, Zoey is a bit there, Chase drools her all the time, but she surprisingly does not notice, and Logan is a jerk. repeat. Quinn blows up Dustin for a weird thing, Nicole is giggling and stupid, Zoey is a bit there, Chase drools her all the time, but she surprisingly does not notice, and Logan is a jerk. repeat. It's like a bottle of shampoo. and the end of the movie, omg again. so useless, NOTHING HAPPENS. It is as if they had been specifically designed so that the film could fit between two episodes of the program and the program would not change completely after the plot of the film.
