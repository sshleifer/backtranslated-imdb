Beloved tale of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog) which is many different things for many different people. On his busy day, "Benji" drinks breakfast at the home of two young children, talks to a law enforcement officer, chases the cat of an old woman and reminds the elderly coffee owner to start the special day. Assistant for some, fun for others, is everyone's companion. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when their young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. From here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> The plot is a routine of writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to outgrow the effects of slow motion. However, audiences will find it hard to resist the cute little puppy, and children of all ages will surely adore it. The cast was never going to be anything other than a background for "Benji." <br /> <br /> It was not what you called inspired, but family fun. Nominated for the Academy Award for the song "Benji's", "I Feel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
