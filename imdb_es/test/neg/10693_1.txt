Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one last nail in the coffin <br /> <br /> that contains his film career before going to the safe world of CBS <br /> <br /> the Saturday night butchery with this supernatural hysterically bad <br /> <br /> activist. <br /> <br /> For such a silly movie, this thing is for sure. Norris is the Chicago policeman <br /> <br /> Frank Shatter. First, what kind of surname is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met Shatters? Genforum.com does not have a list for <br /> <br /> the surname Shatter, which opens any viewer in half to <br /> <br /> replace the "a" in Shatter with an "i". He and his partner, Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson, do the same police routine you've seen before <br /> <br />: make fun of the pimps and drive your captain crazy. <Br /> <br /> Jackson, who looks like the theoretical love child of Whoopi Goldberg <br /> <br /> and Rick James, wears down quickly with his constant <br /> <br /> complaints and Eddie Murphy - Patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin get involved with an emissary from Satan, <br /> <br /> who is presented to us in the opening scenes that are too long. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon that is locked in a crypt by King Richard on Lionhearted. <br /> <br /> The scepter of the devil, from which he obtains his power, breaks into nine pieces and is hidden in nine different parts of the world <br /> <br /> by holy men. In 1951, some grave robbers released <br /> <br /> by accident and he began collecting all nine pieces. He <br /> <br /> disguises himself as an antiques teacher named Lockley and <br /> <br /> always gives a lecture in which a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and a piece of Scepter is taken. <br /> <br /> Norris brings to his cohort "Walker: Texas Blunder" Sheree Wilson, <br /> <br /> who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with her investigation <br /> <br />, they look each other in the eye, and our intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is murdered in <br /> <br /> Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin receives even more complaints <br /> <br /> about the heat, lack of accommodation in restaurants, lousy drivers and <br /> <br /> the fact that Chicago is missing Bulls playoff <br /> <br /> games. Norris even manages to turn a cute Israeli boy into this nightmare <br /> <br />. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around the men, <br /> <br /> guiding them around Israel and without arousing any appropriate suspicion <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually , Lockley (Prosatano) assembles all the pieces of the scepter <br /> <br />, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil. Where to find real blood? Well, Sheree's father is a duke! She has an American accent, but it is the scriptwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrosity <br /> <br /> towards its inevitable conclusion. Of course, this servant of Satan could have killed hundreds of people over the years, but how will he do it <br /> <br /> against a good old-fashioned American kick? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatan has been defeated, killed by his own scepter (he envied him, he did not have to see Bezi steal Calvin's wallet <br /> <br /> again), they invite us to a horrible coda that involves a bearded man <br /> <br /> who has been watching Shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin in <br /> <br /> his search. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two warriors <br /> <br /> from the west will defeat Prosatano. The silent <br /> <br /> bearded man who cared for the couple was none other than <br /> <br /> Jesus ... I'm not kidding. He appears as "Prophet" in the final credits, <br /> <br /> but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference that the filmmakers are trying to show here. <br /> <br /> As in "I Use a Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris is getting old and can not <br /> <br /> get too involved in his fight scenes. He kicks a lot, and <br /> <br /> people fly over the furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives all his <br /> <br /> his line readings in that monotonous voice of his. Oh, what real director might be able to design it! His brother, Aaron, <br /> <br /> who has also directed him in other films, has no sense of the story or the impulse. Scenes are thrown for the sake of the ego, not to entertain <br /> <br />. The scenes in which the dynamic duo meets Bezi drag <br /> <br /> over and over again, and then Bezi is not that important for the rest of the movie <br /> <br />. <br /> <The film was filmed in Israel, which means that Americans <br /> <br /> could insult the Israelis in person. There is not a nice Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is an imbecile. <br /> <br /> The police driver does not know English, and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing more fun than <br /> <br /> mocking those stupid foreigners in their own territory, especially <br /> <br /> when all this racist humor comes from a minority in the United States <br /> <br /> that I would have felt more than offended if the tables became <br /> <br /> and the Israeli policeman was making fun of the African-American policeman in <br /> <br /> Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie is badly written, badly performed and misdirected. It does not work <br /> <br /> as an action, a police drama or even a horror. It only shows that <br /> <br /> the now-defunct Cannon Studios was willing to invest their money <br /> <br /> in anything, no matter how badly it was planned. "Hellbound" is <br /> <br /> surely a more suitable title. I did not like this movie with intensity. <br /> <br /> This is qualified (R) for physical violence, violence with firearms, <br /> <br /> strong, bad words, some sexual references and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
