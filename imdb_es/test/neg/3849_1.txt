I had the bad luck to see this movie at friends' house. What a waste of time. What a complete and complete piece of shit this movie is! Absolutely nothing is funny, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrait of the Germans. There is no plot, the performance choked me and in the end, I personally wanted to beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought that John Woo's films were bad ... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
