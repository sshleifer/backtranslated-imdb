To begin with my comments on the film, I know that the subject is horrible and the words can not adequately express the compassion that any decent person would have with the people who deal with the post-horrors of an atomic bomb thrown near them. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is not treated in a horrible way, except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images there are horrible, and should be a reminder of the devastation that nuclear weapons can cause. Seeing the burned people walking aimlessly or the man combing his hair and the strands of hair that come out, etc., is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first twelve minutes, this Japanese film is about people dealing with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the mid-late '40s. In fact, I found that the story was fast becoming a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole story takes place five years after the bomb and mainly deals with the problems of a family at that time. This is why it became more of a melodrama than a shocking story of a nuclear disaster. Is it simply a story about how these people took their lives after 1950, if one of the women suffered permanent damage and, if so, should she marry? <br /> <br /> This could have been a real impact movie but it was not in that direction
