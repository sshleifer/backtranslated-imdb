I mean really, really, really high and this movie has an opportunity for entertainment. I do not mean normal high, I mean high where reading the agenda would have you in point. otherwise, save the time of your life and do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head against a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete loss of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and the hammaster Shatner) and exactly the kind of garbage they deserve (the multitude of rappers who insist on making movies). Not without the laughter (once again, chemical help is crucial) and certainly not without offending the politically overly sensitive (to which I am always in favor), but ultimately, it is not worth leaving your life.
