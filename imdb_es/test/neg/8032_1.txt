This movie just sucked. I know some people will say that anyone who thinks they are not good "just does not understand". I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is completely dreck. The main character is so upset that I do not care what he does. He is, as has been said in another review, bouncing like an annoying little monkey. I just could not stand it or force myself to take care of myself. This is the case with most of the characters that seem to be trying to be silly or weird. I liked the character of Mel Gibson and the characters of Milla Jovovich and I wish they had focused more on them. Mile is, of course, beautiful, unfortunate and you really feel for her and for what has happened and why she is the way she is. I see the character of Gibsons almost as Frankenstien. I just wish he had saved Milla and punished the hotel with all the useless and boring characters that lived in it. Mile Rating 10 Movie Rating 0
