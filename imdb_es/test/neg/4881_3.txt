I saw Bogard when it was released in the 70s. It was one of those photos that received a grade of X for violence. We snuck into our local mill, and we saw it anyway. Very nice picture A lot of blood from the street fights, although the cheap sound effects for the punches took away something. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the first scenes in which Bogard meets this beautiful brunette in an apartment that she is showing him. Without saying a word, he picks it up, puts it on the windowsill and nails it. From what I remember the image sailed from that moment. Then, when I discovered that Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. Many of the scenes that I remember were missing, I was wondering if in fact, this was the same image.
