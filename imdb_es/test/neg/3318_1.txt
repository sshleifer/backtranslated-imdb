Even if I had not read "The Queen of the Damned" by Anne Rice in "Vampire Chronicles", I probably would have thought that this movie was just horrible. <br /> <br /> It was insipid, without plot, it did not make any sense at all. I stayed for a while reflecting on the dissociated plot of the book, and the more I thought about it, the worse it was. Associating it in some way with the previous Chronicles movie is ridiculous, as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie, let alone with the book. The few ideas taken from Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" were massacred and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and a pathetic excuse for a legacy to be Aaliyah's latest film. . In truth, it is also an insult to the Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Possibly the only compliment can be done for the purposes of sound, as well as some of the graphics. As good as they are, it is still not enough to regret the time I spent watching this movie. In fact, I enrolled in this membership for the sole reason to communicate with people who bother to watch this movie (7 years after the release, as it could be) to not waste your time or expect much more than disappointments.
