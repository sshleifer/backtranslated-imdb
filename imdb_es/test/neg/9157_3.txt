A real yawn and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a reasonably good one, but it falls far away from the brand. Charlie is enlisted to help uncover the murder of a scientist who works for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans of another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the performance does not fare much better. The only salvation for me in the movie was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. It gives the film a bit of comedy and has some very scared faces, but after that the choices are pretty slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and joins Chan's daughter of all things. What's wrong with Sidney Toler? He's decent enough, but he seems to be struggling to get the movie. What I noticed the most was the way the film was filmed. Chan's director Phil Rosen, who I generally like most of his entries, uses many long shots without action (like Charlie's initial walk from home). Why? The movie has only 64 minutes to scream out loud! Pictures like that tell me that the director had to fill the time because the script was even weaker than he was used to. Probably this is not the worst film of Chan that has ever been made, but until now it is the worst I've seen unfortunately.
