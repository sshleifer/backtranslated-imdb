Oh, yes, I have to agree with the others who describe this as atrocious. The performance in this four-hour show is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe that any of the actors in this production can make a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each one delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of commitment or emotional investment with any other character. None seems to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is ridiculous and unconvincing. Were the editors of the movie asleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes look authentic for the Regency period but the fabrics look in the twentieth century and the colors (especially the blue colors) are discordant and I do not think they were available at the beginning of the 19th century. silk. <br /> <br /> Also the hair: men have obvious haircuts in the 70s, and women have "big hair", especially the woman who plays Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All the female characters, Young and old, are quite charming, but this does not make up for the lack of acting skills. The actress who plays "Anne" seems to be about forty years old, while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting team if we had to find the woman who plays Anne credible? He spends much of his time looking pensively with his eyes at the level of the horizon, either inside or outside. I still wonder what that is supposed to convey. Regret maybe? Yes, this production is unfortunate! <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Louisa was truly atrocious. She screams, screams, laughs, and jumps up like a twelve-year-old girl (my apologies to anyone of twelve who reads this) who was waiting impatiently for me the moment she hits. How this behavior to attract an adult man is supposed to be beyond me. Most would back off when she opened her mouth for the first time to laugh and scream. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Captain Wentworth plays a person so insipid and colorless that he wonders why a woman could harass him for eight years. <Br /> <br /> The union of the couple at the end is neither done nor explained convincingly. How did they meet again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; That's true No, there has to be more than that and it's not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this production with two stars: one because it's Austens' work and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were beautiful. The only reason I could see all the production is because I was sick with the flu and I took it out of the library. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you have not read the book.
