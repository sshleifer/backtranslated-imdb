Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I saw it was 10 years old, my parents had left and I stayed at home with my two brothers. It was in May 1970 (I know because I found a note about the cycle of horror movies that had a network). It is one of the most vivid memories I have with the boys. We finished everything in a bed and covered ourselves up to the head! Our first horror movie! We kept talking about that for years and laughing at the moment. They were horror movies. Nowadays horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children enjoying without analyzing the plot, the cast and the dialogues? Most likely, that was it. But for me, this is a great movie!
