SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A film full of clich√©s that somehow makes a statement against death with dignity, although it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years (he apparently wrote his big sales book just a year ago, so not everything is desperation). Organize an assisted suicide with your doctor, who will return in a week. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, help in a serial killer case. He recruits the brave, I do not want to do it, but I'm so good at that, Jolie police, and they track impossible clues to draw very unlikely conclusions in a matter of moments. Hey, that old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel next to the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's laughable. However, he's not smart enough to discover that the doctor who's going to help is the killer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington to kill him (earlier than scheduled), he has a change of heart and fights incredibly for his life. Cut the forced bad guy about to shoot the good man scene when BANG shoots the gun, but the bad boy did not shoot! No, the woman comes out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
