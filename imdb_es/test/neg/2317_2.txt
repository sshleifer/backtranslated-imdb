This little movie is remarkable just because it's the worst movie that Abbott and Costello have ever made. It is terrible in every way: unpleasant music, horrible choreography (check out the uncomfortable main dancer), effects and special games of cheese, wooden actors (the protagonists are barely at the high school level in their profession and do not he knew later) And a script without a single laugh. Better times were to come for the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello meet with Captain Kidd, and it is very preferable, since it is the television series, which was sometimes inspired. But this one jumps.
