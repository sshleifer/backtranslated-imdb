What on earth? How to watch an episode of Neighbors after drinking two bottles of cough medicine, nightmare and without any sense. I was waiting for the smart part where everything fits into place and saves the movie. Maybe I was there and I just missed it, or I got lost. <br /> <br /> My biggest suspicion is that it is a barely concealed attempt to market a new drug that is about to go out. I would not say "do not see it", but I'll say it's pretty poor on all levels, like in a high-definition scene. Hit. Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's just dandy.
