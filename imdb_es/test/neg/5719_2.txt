Possible spoilers As Peter Jackson has shown so brilliantly in his trilogy "The Lord of the Rings", it is quite possible to make good movies, even great ones, within the genre of heroic fantasy. The genre has distinguished the literary antecedents, that go back to the medieval chivalric romances, in particular to the legends of Arturo, on which Tolkien and other authors have drawn. However, apart from 'The Lord of the Rings', it's hard to think of other swords and spells movies that are good. I agree with the critic who said that the best of a bad group was the "Willow" by Ron Howard, and even that achieved a small distinction apart from being a film just mediocre instead of a bad one. 'Red Sonja', however, can not achieve the even more modest distinction of simply being a bad movie instead of a dreadful one. <br /> <br /> As with 'Willow', many of the elements of the plot in `Red Sonja 'are derived from' The Lord of the Rings'. An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers to achieve an ambition for world domination, but is frustrated by a diverse group of heroes. The film, set in the Age of Hyborians, a barbaric era in the distant past of the earth, begins with the villain of the piece, the evil Queen Gedren, who makes unwanted sexual advances to the heroine Sonja. When these are rejected, Gedren (who is not a woman who accepts no for an answer) reacts by murdering Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985, presumably he still considered himself politically correct not only to turn the head of villains into a woman, but also into one of the main reasons for his villainy thwarted by lesbian lust). <br /> <br /> Gedren's next move is to capture the Talisman, a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by killing the entire female priesthood with little clothing in charge of protecting it, just as they are about to destroy it because they feel that their powers have become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative. However, Sonja herself has not been inactive, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy in which summa cum laude graduates, and intends to take revenge. On the way he joins Kalidor, a heroic wandering swordsman who resembles Aragorn of Tolkien, Prince Tarn, the evil ruler of a kingdom that has fallen into the hands of the powers of Gedren and Falkon, Tarn's loyal servant. The rest of the film is quite predictable, since Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the talisman out of control. <br /> <br /> What does this do? so bad movie? Well, acting, to begin with. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor offers the kind of typical wood-faced poker performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, with a strong foreign accent. However, compared to Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine, she looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language problems, transmitting each line in the mechanical and toneless voice of someone who has just completed the third lesson of a "Teach Yourself, English by Mail" course. One wonders if she was hired for the role just to make Arnie look good in comparison. The other characters, though they do not direct their own private struggles against the English language, are simply cartoons of cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most detestable young people of all. <br /> <br /> A guilt even worse than the Bad acting, however, is the almost total lack of imagination of the movie. This is a particularly evident failure in a fantasy film, since films of this genre must rely on their imaginative power to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be caused by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can be persuaded, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle Earth, that elves, magicians and hobbits exist, and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of A magic ring When we see "Red Sonja" we are not convinced of anything, except that we are seeing a group of actors with bad accents who fight each other on a hill for the possession of lime green football. <br /> <br /> This lack of Imagination even begins with the title of the movie. British science fiction author Brian Aldiss, when faced with the exotic names given to his characters, responded that it did not make much sense to create a fictional extraterrestrial society with its own distinctive culture if they were to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe . . (It is true that Tolkien could <br /> <br /> get away with giving Sam one of his main characters, but that was because the Hobbits were supposed to be a reassuring relative, the equivalent of middle-earth of tweedy, pipe (smoking English) Similarly, giving the heroine of a story ostensibly set in a barbaric era of yesteryear a common girl name like `Sonia '(which is how the name is pronounced' Sonja ') is as appropriate as calling it' Betty 'or' Mary-Jane '. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they were bothered at all. Fantasy must be done convincingly, or doing nothing, obviously, it was filmed in a remote mountainous area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture.The few buildings we see, such as the talisman temple or Gedren's palace , they are obviously cheap sets. The capital city of Tarn has been destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman, but we do not really see this event; all we see is what could be a thunderstorm on the other side of a hill. At first, you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army Gedren has at her disposal, it becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, he wonders if it is the Talisman at work or simply a member of the crew who inadvertently leans against the whole. If we can not enjoy this movie for anything else, at least we can enjoy it for its involuntary humor; A good example of the film school so bad that it's fun. Ed Wood would have been proud of this. If it had aired on Californian television the night before the recall election, Gray Davis would remain governor. 2/10.
