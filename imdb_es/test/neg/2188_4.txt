The movie is fine. Which means I do not regret having seen it! I found the performance purely and most of the stupid dialogue ("oh no, this was my grandmother's bible!"). It's a kind of bad version of U-turn. A man arrives in a desert city nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And because the cause is involved in something, he thought he could leave it behind. The movie is quite predictable and there really is nothing new in it. When it's finished, you really did not care. Most of the characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green! In general, just another movie from the United States, but it's good to be entertained on the boring Wednesday night.
