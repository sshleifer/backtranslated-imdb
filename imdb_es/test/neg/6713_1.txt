I think that Cockpuncher is the best work that has left Steven Seagal's factory in a long time. This movie was the first I've seen since previewing the movie. My point? He's ready. All movies are the same. Maybe it's good in Machete because he will not be the star. We can only wait. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thanks for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an incredible speech. You really influenced some people out there. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Umm ... I like the smoker who killed a bunch of fools. Every time someone smells menthol, LOOK. Because there could be a murderer with a silenced (and another noisy) glock who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Are those ten?
