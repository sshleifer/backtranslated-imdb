I was very interested in seeing this film despite the article I read about the director in the Tattler magazine. I do not judge movies for what the director may or may not have done. This first feature was very difficult to see. I discovered that the split screens were a distraction to the drama of the movie, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances and the movie was a copy of several other movies I've seen. There really was nothing new about this
