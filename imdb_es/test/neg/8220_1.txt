For those who can send me unpleasant emails, push them. There is a trend in Hollywood where those who create too extravagant films are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State is usually one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Sure, Zach Braff, star of a fairly overrated comedy, surprises people with a certain talent behind the camera, but that does not guarantee the kind of praise a movie like this one has been receiving. The story is often too thin and superficial to provide a real insight. People have compared this movie with The Graduate, but that kind of people are those who try to exaggerate independent films. Independent films are subject to the same mentality of success and strangeness that normally affects studio movies, but people seem to have forgotten that there are many more bad films than good films. Garden State is not atrocious, but it's not great. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is too fast, resulting in a rather rapid reappearance of Large in his previous life. After ten years, people tend to act as if they had never left. Where is the discomfort? Of course, the situation is always resolved with a quick scene of drug tasting (which, as I said, was described quite accurately). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, which gives us the idea that the emotion will emerge later in a deeper and better thought way. However, he fails to meet those fronts, which makes us wonder why the trip to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (such as Peter Saarsgard's tomb robbery tendencies). It was not completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it is not.
