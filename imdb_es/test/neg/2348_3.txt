<br /> <br /> A few years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out that it was a flop and a B-Movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. . (Maybe they did not have enough money for that in the budget?). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
