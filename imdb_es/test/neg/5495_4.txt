I entered this film with a lot of desire to like it: it led a film festival at the beginning of the year and featured a star cast. But (and you could say that there was a "but" on the way) is a failure of a movie. The outstanding character acting from Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by the editing and mischief of the cast of cast. Turturro's performance is mediocre, and most of the comedy is exaggerated. Recurring puppets make no sense, and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, there are some wonderful moments dotted in the movie. A really touching theatrical moment, several of the seductions and some of the comic colors really work. Unfortunately, they are eclipsed by the diffuse and incoherent script and some bad acting.
