Yes, of course, the film already looked horrible and not very promising, but the premise and the cast looked good, so I still hoped that this movie would entertain me. This, however, unfortunately was not the case. The premise is good, but the story is full of improbability and is logically wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is potentially unloaded in the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. You think it's good enough to make a good adventure movie. However, this movie fails to entertain and I think that is the biggest flaw in this movie. Maybe he takes himself too seriously and a little more humor would not have done any harm to the movie. Instead, now it's nothing more than a cheap-looking, boring movie, filled with one improbable event after another, which also steals a little too much from other, more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park" obviously. <br /> <br /> The characters also do not help make the film more attractive or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as a 'heroic' main leader. However, the rest of the characters really get confused with the movie and they become very uninteresting to do. The film relies rather on its visual aspect, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also has a very irritating character. Basically, all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest, oh, so bad. Your character is simply not nice. And the rest of the characters ... well, I've forgotten their names, I think that's enough to say them. However, it is true that only the performance of Ben Kingsley makes it worthwhile to watch this movie. He is really excellent in his role as a villain entrepreneur, but from the moment he disappears from the movie, the movie really goes downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is extremely bad. It has some ghastly-looking CGI effects and could not even make the simpler "blue screen" effects look convincing in the movie. The sets also look horrible and cheap, as if they could fall and break in every moment. <br /> <br /> The film never gets tense, exciting or adventurous, since the story is presented in the least interesting and attractive way possible. . It is a very distant movie with distant characters that does not impress. There are many action sequences, but they are all so ridiculous that they seem ridiculous that they never get so tense or so good. <br /> <br /> So, basically, this movie lacks everything you need to make a genre. Movie like this is a good and successful one. It's sad to see how director Peter Hyams has sunk in recent years, after making some good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
