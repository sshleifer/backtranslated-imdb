Well acted, yes. Very well, I must say, although I do not speak Chezck. Good cinematography But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly what is going to happen. Well, maybe the end is not so predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies that you have the feeling of having already seen, and forget about the next day. <br /> <br /> I just received an IMDb note that says my comment was not long enough. That's really sad, because I have no idea what else to say about this movie, which really says a lot about it, do not you think? The thing is ... It has no soul or originality. Compare this movie with Barrio, or Riff Raff, filmed more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently filmed The Child). It's sad to see that this is a much worse movie.
