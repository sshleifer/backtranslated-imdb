Bare Wench is another softcore parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen of those things out there). He has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain), and a dorky whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. <br /> <br /> Well, then I'm thinking, "Cool, great-looking women, who have soft lesbian sex with each other for about 10 minutes or so, this should be really good." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers spoiled it. There is nothing in this video that really qualifies as a sex scene. There are a couple of false starts, but most of the action is just women who pose for the camera. I suppose that once the producers spent their money on the women and spent more on taking their clothes off, they had no money left to actually do something. And I think they also used all their assigned nudity time too early, because towards the end of the video, there's a lot of nonsensical dialogues that, obviously, are being used for no other reason than to avoid runtime. "You are a liar! No, you are! You enter the cave! No, you go! I think we should go home! Well, I do not!" This goes on and on and on forever. <br /> <br /> There are much better things than this.
