If you ever plan to rent (hopefully not buy) this movie, think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die. I'm just wondering if Busey was arrested for something and he was sentenced to play in this movie because I just do not see the guy who performed much better with Keanu Reeves in the Point Break game in this mess. It was a movie to feel good, but there are thousands of other movies to feel good that make you laugh without wanting to recover your money. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would tell someone to rent this movie is to watch Gary Busey jump like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, go to Quigley and go rent SpongeBob or something like that.
