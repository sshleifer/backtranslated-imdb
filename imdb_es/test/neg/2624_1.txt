Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion at all in the movie. The symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and the Bosnian old woman who gives a picture of her son to Arbor "will concretize" her will, will awaken the super-mother sleeping inside her, a corpse devoured by worms to show the horror of the genocide. .. too much is sometimes worse than not enough). <br /> <br /> This movie is just an advertisement, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a hero. He worked for the United Nations. Remember that the UN did not protect civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the true heroes of this war? A Canadian judge who conducted a post-mortem trial for atrocities that occurred mainly because her organization did not prevent them? Where is the criticism in this movie?
