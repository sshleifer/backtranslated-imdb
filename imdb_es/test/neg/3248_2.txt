Okay, I'd give this one a 1, but I'll give it a two because I laughed while watching this movie ... First, I can make a much better movie than this one ... in a week ... Special effects made that this movie seemed like a joke. One should not make such films with horrible special effects because people will not take it seriously. The acting and direction was also horrible. The script had many holes in the plot and the whole movie was not believable at all. This has to be the worst movie in India. The songs were also bad. The performance was bad and artificial. I need to say more. Do not watch this movie unless you're curious to see how bad it is. That's why I saw it. I go to the cinema and I wanted to see how bad a bad movie can be. Trust me, I saw one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
