We will never know The truth about 9/11. And this film of poor quality proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently saw a YouTube report that said there were no planes involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that supposedly all the news programs were provided with shots from the same angle of the Towers from a mysterious source (probably the mesh? <br /> <br /> It is a convincing video, and although I am not a conspiracy theorist of Wacko per se, I'm still not sure if the actual planes hit something that day (the Towers, the Shanksville field, the Pentagon) - Because there are no aircraft debris available. (And what about those infamous "boxes"? blacks "None recovered.) A million other theories abound, all of them courting a drop of Truth flooded in an ocean of speculation.But they will drown in Malarkey before finding something true or worthy of speculation in THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSION OF 9 / 11, a movie with no budget that tries to close the stable door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped. <br /> <br /> The writer and director Leigh Scott is obviously a US citizen after I wanted to illustrate to the public what the 560 page report could reveal. It would be useful if your movie had actors, instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a girl who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy that I'm pretty sure he's trying to be Sean Bean . It would help if your camera operator did not have Parkinson's; if the director of lighting was not trying to save on electricity; It would help if your editor did not have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if the soundtrack was not a new esoteric world order; and the loop probably should have been inserted when people really moved their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can not even call this propaganda. It's very funny And by funny, I mean you can not see. <br /> <br /> You can not squeeze a theme from this complex in a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all those attractive phrases we've learned. a: bin Laden's intention to attack, buy arms in Somalia, a non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi attending a flight school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know that everything is retrospective, therefore, every discussion that the intelligence agents in question have between them reeks of false hindsight, all in an orderly conversation. Like the artificial reverse engineering, everything relevant is mentioned succinctly, so that we can shake our heads in amazement at the incompetence with which all these branches of government were screwed. A boy with tomato sauce on his face. Now, that would be considered torture if most men did not consider it a fired one. <br /> <br /> The motto is: "What would happen if the attack had stopped?" According to the story of this film, and, we assume, according to the Commission's Report, the CIA and other clandestine agencies were ready to capture Bin Laden and they did not. Everyone involved in the "terrorism" reports (does it mean that they really read these reports?) They are so worried that we just want to slap them for their bad performance. <br /> <br /> However, the whole story is much deeper than the banal alludes to the negligent Ku Bush Klan to the Americans after 9/11. Now we know that even capturing bin Laden before the 9/11 attack would not have changed or accomplished anything. The wheels were in motion with or without that Taliban figure whose participation was the possible product of someone's feverish imagination to unite the United States against a common enemy. . Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack" us. While Ron Paul was trying to elucidate, it was a case of setbacks in the Middle East: "they" were so fed up with the United States placing their infidel feet "there" that brought the war "here". So, even though George W. Death likes to brag about the absurd, "we are fighting against them there so we do not have to fight them here," actually "because we are there, the fight has been brought here. "<br /> <br /> The September 11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of the terrorists, but because of the gross negligence of the Bush administration, which we know (without the poll of the Commissions) had all the information from the Clinton administration onwards; information about terrorist cells that reach critical mass and their intention to cause chaos. But the Texas Oil Idiot, who refused to read his daily summaries and preferred to spend his vacations at his Crawford Ranch instead of spending another day at work, canceled the duty he had sworn to fulfill: protect the American public. <br /> <br /> And then the scum who called himself president used the attacks provoked by his negligence as a political hammer against his own foolish peasants to get a second term, destroy the US Constitution and bring the United States to a False war based on a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Oddly enough, the film never steps close to the Ku Bush Klan, without offering opinion or judgment, and Leigh Scott wants to remain neutral. Tell that to the raped and looted hundreds of thousands in the False War on Terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> By pure coincidence, I realized that I was watching this DVD while I was carrying my "Bush lied, thousands died".
