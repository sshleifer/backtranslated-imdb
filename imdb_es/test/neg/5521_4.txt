HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But critics quickly showed their ignorance combined with a total lack of sense of humor in criticizing this program because they thought it was a cheap attempt to collect the money. the success of American GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between US GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both opened with "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & the Comets. Both took place in a bygone era and both presented Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some important differences. While GRAFFITTI was held in California in 1962 and focused on a group of newly graduated high school students who were about to take that big step toward adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and focused on a group of teenagers in high school. Joys and tribulations of adolescence. <br /> <br /> HAPPY DAYS were originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley and the ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK of the comets. But when the oldies became attractive, thanks to the success of GRAFFITTI in the United States, and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK in 1954, they entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a success again in 1974, royalty payments skyrocketed . So a "remake" of the song (the correct term now is "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme of HAPPY DAYS was introduced for the second season if memory serves me. right. <br /> <br /> Both fans and enemies agree that this show is escapist. The liberties were taken and the details were overlooked, which makes this show less than completely authentic. <br /> <br /> This is perfectly fine. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But from time to time writers sometimes dared to discuss controversial issues. One episode focused on the Cunninghams building of a shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with the dream of starting a new life. The issue of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army comrade who turned out to be black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were sadly an acceptable part of the American way of life). The draft theme even appeared in a later episode! <br /> <br /> The program was originally established in 1955. One of the problems that was treated with prudence was with the cast. Most were teenagers and, as the years passed, it was obvious that they were aging, so the series aged with the cast, moving the series of safe waters of the Eisenhower years to the Age of Camelot, all the way to JFK. and then in the turbulent second half of the 1960s. That, along with the writers who are running out of ideas, and later, the cast members like Ron Howard left the series, wisely resigning while they were in front, made me wish that everyone had done the right thing by disconnecting this program and giving up while they were ahead. That, along with the studio audience that worshiped the idols that simply could not be controlled every time the Grand Fonzie entered the scene, began to get very thin very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally represented the fabulous Fifty like us. I LIKE to remember that era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I would prefer to listen to the "original versions" about those "new stereo recordings", those "new stereo recordings" worked very well in HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I regret having bought the DVD! Unlike the full DVD of the first season, the original music of the second full season has been replaced by different music. While it's great that the original episodes have been digitally restored to digital perfection, the elimination of the original music destroyed what made this show so much fun to watch.
