The movie has so much potential that it did not develop. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and so does Bill Paxton. The landscape is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are clean. The problem with this movie is that the story is very underdeveloped and the plot is not going anywhere. The film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.
