One of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first one!). Now, as with other movies, they have totally ruined Carrie's franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the movie progresses like geriacs in a rickety truck. There is almost no fear and this film is replete with all the various stereotypes of the high school (ie, the football athlete, the evil leader of the joy, the followers and, of course, the black nail polish that carries misfits). Another sad thing about this program is that you know what will happen the moment you see the opening credits. Of course, the girl looks humiliated and then becomes a mad psychic killer ... yawning ... <br /> <br /> I've been there. Done that. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to have been forced to make this movie. Emily Bergl is as terrifying as a cabbage doll while Jack London ... let's say I did not pay to see Wood perform. Apart from the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to bond with the first film. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if you can project objects like Carrie, then for the love of God you'll get out of there. what theater ......
