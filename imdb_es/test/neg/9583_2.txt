It seems a pretty innocent option at first: the name "employee of the month" could sound with "Office Space" and the program "Office Clerk". I do not think so. This is not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, whoever the boy's name is, was a complete idiot, and has a sick and perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being attracted to feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals his top-notch job and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second I enter the room when my family is watching (and believe me, they were only seeing it more because they prayed that there would be at least some relief, maybe even some fable at the end, sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good ones look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they did not have time to look good. No memorial was made. <br /> <br /> This movie has a limit madness. He does not respect the elderly, the dead, the women, and the director tries to make people like him. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie two points just because the soundtrack was good. But even that was not so memorable. If you were lucky not to see this in theaters, definitely my friends, do not do it at home.
