I did not understand the people who rated it with more than 5. I think it's a horrible movie from any point of view. Arguments, acting, art, dialogue, music, whatever! I do not mind a low budget ... However, you have to get some point. Wandering, wondering ... nonsense ... then two guys started kissing on the bed. horrible, just horrible I love indie movies, I do not care if it's slow. However, this movie disappointed me from any perspective. Even the Graffito, not the artistic one. <br /> <br /> I was wondering what kind of people you would like. I am a woman in my 30s. Is it for teenagers who have some kind of loneliness in life, or just do not understand it? What did I win then? Wasting time! Please, go for some others.
