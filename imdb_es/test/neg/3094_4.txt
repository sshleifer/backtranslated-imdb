directed by albert pyun in his inimitably awful but strangely hypnotic style, "los seis locos" is another jewel in the crown for the exclusive hugo haas of this decade (frank jess?). Overdraft "with style", incoherent tracing, waiting times in the middle of action sequences for eurodisco torch - song performances, all this seems to be a meaning of traits for our Pyun man. The most interesting thing is how he always gets the best B movie releases, compared to Wynorski or some of the other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not bad, although they often seem a bit confused. Take a look at "Postmortem", "Mean Guns", & "Omega Doom" to see the chaos of Pyun first class!
