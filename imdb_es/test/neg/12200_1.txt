A complete and absolute waste of my precious two hours. The whole movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people who are running out of alcohol, a car crashing, people who have more sex, people who have sex, people who are crying the people who have more sex. The motto of this film should have read "Come and see what the hell our characters are! They are drugged! They are addicted to coca! They are a disaster! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter? Just give us your money please, because surely we do not care about anything else! "An absolutely terrible movie. He never went anywhere, never met the characters (they did not even say what these people did to win such a big house and so much money, cars and coke), and it was just boring. You may like the movie a bit more if you are a fool, but for the vast majority of us who are not, this movie is a waste of time and film.
