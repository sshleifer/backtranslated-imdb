Absolutely inane film starring Abbott and Costello. Even our little children would get angry more and more with this complete mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Sure, I had to be part of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that Costello's mother in the movie sounded like Fay Bainter? Luckily, for Mrs. Bainter, who was not in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no emotion for the children. The jokes, if any, are quite past. Part of the singing is well done, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
