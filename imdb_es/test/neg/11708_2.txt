I realize that a period piece is expensive to make, and that this style of filming (shots with the camera frame, camera in motion, shots with large aperture, washing) allows these films to be made at a price. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows to make more period pieces. Like any style, it has detractors and sympathizers, there are even those who believe that this form of filming has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only part of the money saved, could have been spent on the script For any style that is used, a movie needs good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is very good in its majority. The writing not so much. It consists of a collection of fragments taken from the book and many of the elements relevant to the plot are omitted, which makes it an unconnected collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, do not look at it under any circumstances. If you have not read the book, you are easily pleased and have nothing better to do, there is nothing wrong with seeing it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better.
