What really surprised me about this movie was that it sounded so fake. First of all, who in the late 80's (when the movie takes place) lived like this family? A university professor would not earn enough money to maintain the lifestyle that I saw in the movie. Therefore, he and his wife would stay at home with financial problems, especially when she has cancer. Second, Streep is my age, and most of the women, particularly in her class (educated, white, wealthy) experienced the feminist movement. However, this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior. In fact, I felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband as an emotional child by attending to all her needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that people moved so many people is incredible. I have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and I really like Meryl Streep, but gad, what a manipulation and lying movie this is.
