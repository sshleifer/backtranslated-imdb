If you like to glimpse a couple of moments of fleeting excision in some attractive women, it is possible that this movie has a second or two of fun. If you like to see scenes of "action" poorly conceived and executed, there are many. If both are blind and deaf, I still advise you not to have this film in your presence. Surely it is the worst or very close to the worst movie I've seen. And it seems that some money was spent on it. Talk about throwing money away! As an editor, I hope that the "editors" of this "movie" are never allowed to edit a movie, a book or even a post-it note. As a writer, I hope that the author (s) is never again allowed near a broken crayon. You'd think I'm not recommending you see this movie. Not so Hit it (so you can stop the pain when you need it) and find out how bad a movie can be.
