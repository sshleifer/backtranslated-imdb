The French make pro Marxist movies or anti-Marxist films, with some in between. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the latest in this genre. From the opening credits that tell the viewer what music is going to be played and who composed it, you know that you will be involved in the claim of the middle class. It is the film of an old man with an excess of more than 40 people. It is also run by an old man along with an old team that has nothing to say about life to the viewer. The plot is not only banal but ridiculous. How many films reveal the plot through the dialogue only to repeat the same message through a flashback about five minutes later? Maybe the director and the actors had a low retention capacity? In truth there is no sustainable conspiracy at all. It is an enigma with holes like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> Whether intentional or not, it's a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious herd of each scene. I admit that it has some well framed shots, although you could not have used a fixed camera in this movie, I would have woken them all! In addition to being a meaningless story, the film allows the upper middle class to show their values ​​and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location. A revealing line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that he does not need to lock his car while he is at the resort. Oh, dear me. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert makes a comment about spilling a fake tear for a scene. Smiling, she says: "As they do in the American Actor's Studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor's Studio. <br /> <br /> If there is a statement that stands out in my mind, it is when Huppert says that "we have friends for the weekend and all the servants are far away." There is no doubt that everyone had escaped from the mind set not to be associated with such a frightening movie. <br /> <br /> Medical safety note.In the film they show a scalding of hot water covered with ointment and a bandage.This should never be done. you must use cold water. <br /> <br /> Less 10 points.
