I remember when it was published it was the first kung fu movie seen on our way and we were all excited to see it for sure. Although the action was mediocre at best, it gave us our first kung fu test and our first test of both the wrong dubbing and the wrong doing movies or more precisely the way the Chinese were making movies at that time. They were, undoubtedly, inferior to the question, but here there was an entertainment value and that went on for sure. The kung fu craze had begun and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" would soon follow that or "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to lead the way.
