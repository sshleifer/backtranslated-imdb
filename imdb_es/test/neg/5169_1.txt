Kokoda was inspired by the events at the Kokoda runway during World War II, when the Australian militia slowed down and finally stopped a push by 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film is set in this period of time, but it is fiction and everything that happens is just a mixture of standard scenes from other war movies. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some of the scenes are simply there to take us to the sensation that this conflict was horrific without comparison, when there seems to be little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and neither of them showed mercy. Both sides suffered from a shortage of logistics and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply line grew and this eventually led to its downfall. On the other hand, as the Australians retreated closer to Port Mores, their supply line decreased. Some of the scenes seem to come straight out of the standard scene manual to include in any war movie. The film was disoriented and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have ended up with a great movie about one of Australia's best moments, the film Kokoda is a superficial disappointment.
