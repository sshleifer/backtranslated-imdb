Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud during the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; Especially in the concept. After that, the joke became thin. As an animated short of 15-20 minutes, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of a joke that lasts too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, expressed by Ludicrous, has several raw and funny phrases. Unfortunately, that's all because the child's pet rat is good, since he does not contribute anything else to the story. Eventually, I got bored with both his comments and the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park, and another animation aimed at adults. I also play several games of pimps online, so I am partial to stories about pimps. The transition from the little boy to the small pimp was brilliant; but after that, both the story and the dialogue became redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a five. It is worth looking at the great concept and the voice acting. Just do not expect much more or you will be quite disappointed.
