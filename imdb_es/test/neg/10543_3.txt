I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequel simply did not work. There are some funny jokes in the opening, involving members of the home for the blind, but beyond that point I just got bored. The sequel is also full of a lot of funny, low-brow humor. Only this time it's not funny! Many of the gags revolve around crunchy Japanese stereotypes. Almost all Japanese characters seem to be stinging fish. Does everyone in Japan bite fish? Troma movies are known to be more than a little irreverent, but if you're going to use humor with racial stereotypes, at least make it fun. I can not laugh if they give me the same shit I've seen a million times before! One thing I have to give credit for is free nudity. There are even more free nudes than in the first. But all in all I felt very disappointed, and the movie ends with a tedious chase scene that made me gasp and snort, dying for the movie to fade to black. At least there's a hilarious line from the movie that made me laugh out loud. After the villain says a line of Shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an old woman) responds by saying: "F ** k you - that's David Mamet". <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
