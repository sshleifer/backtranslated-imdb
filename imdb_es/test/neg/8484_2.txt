SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I have seen many movies. I did not think that I would ever see a movie that I really hated. The son in the mask ruined it. The son in the mask is so bad that I will not even make a detailed comment as I usually do. In fact, I'm not even going to write much. I think you should all know that this movie is horribly horrible. And poor Jamie Kennedy. It was amazing in Scream, but now this movie! In addition, this film takes a film of SMO-CAN and turns it into this film of silly children that even children will not like. This movie also consists of a very rude humor. Like the woman with the nose. She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes something white comes out of her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, a children's movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought adults would like it. Frankly, it made the movie even more corny and crude. <br /> <br /> Here is the basic and stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the incredible Loki mask and becomes a cartoon dog. When Tim pays more attention to the baby with special powers, the cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyote scam. Then Loki takes the baby with incredible powers and Tim and Loki have a very cheesy animated fight. Tim is wearing the mask. Everything ends happily. Pity that this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> In general, the original mask was a fantastic movie by Jim Carrey. This, basically, is not. Please, do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake when renting this. I do not want you to make exactly the same mistake. I feel horrible for not being able to write a detailed comment, but really, what's there to comment? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I'd give you one, but come on, it's basically a movie for kids. . <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: The Mask.
