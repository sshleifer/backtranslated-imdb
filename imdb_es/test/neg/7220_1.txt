This television show is a waste of time if you want to learn <br /> <br /> about animals that watch the discovery channel. If you want to see <br /> <br /> nincompoops on TV, just watch MTV. MTV is synonymous with music television <br /> <br /> is not an imbecile of the D-listers who make presentations with delay or spoiled children crying <br /> <br /> their hearts for not getting a BMW for their 16 birthday. I bet <br /> <br /> that if you like this program I bet you love the Bam alive, and asshole, huh? I think my IQ dropped ten points when I saw this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two jackass shows and the animal planet <br /> <br /> Some people think this is a good combination. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think it's retardant. <br /> <br /> And if you realize that it is very similar to Jackass <br /> <br /> and live the Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is horrible
