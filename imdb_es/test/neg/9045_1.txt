Umberto Lenzi reaches new lows with this recycled garbage. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of a Jim Jones-type religious cult in New Guinea. She hires a disheveled guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult site located in the jungle. This is another (!) Cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if it were not for Lenzi, who has completed this movie with scenes from his superior "The Man from Deep River". I mean that every cannibal scene is removed directly from this movie, which I think makes it as credible as Al Adamson. I felt cheated *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.
