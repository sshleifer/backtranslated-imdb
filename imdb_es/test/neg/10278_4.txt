I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and I must say: it did not impress me at all. I put myself on the side of the other posters when it comes to good performances, but some good performances are not a good movie. <br /> <br /> In the discussion panel, I found a review of an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. He says: "'Deed Poll' is a film that raises many questions but barely responds to a few, a disturbing film and above all an attempt at categorization, a very conventional experiment and sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the partly very impressive edition and the good work of the camera (Steffen Ritter) compensate for the big holes in the plot and some technical errors (especially in the sound) .However, the boredom with which the public has to fight for 40 minutes remains. " Unfortunately, this is true. I was not intrigued by history at all. The protagonists are cold people, without ambitions. They do a lot of drugs and they have a lot of sex (incestuous). And that? On many occasions, the direction seemed virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor quality of the sound was enormously disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? What is the message behind all this? The anonymous critic said: "Somehow, Biermann could not establish a clear point, so the film remains hanging in the air without a message, therefore, the boredom that I blame the film." The film is reserved and without emotions, cold, almost neutral and does not take much time to see the flaws: for long periods the characters of Sean and Ivy are not believable (clearly have difficulties with pronunciation in English), the character of the silent brother is not very developed. moments are very promising, however, in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the only true love scene) an intensity is reached that we would love to see the whole movie.As a spectator, one has to regret the possibilities that they have given him. " Again, I must agree. I liked the final scene, especially the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer during the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, however, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited). <br /> <br /> In general, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea, a controversial good idea wasted, but it was a It is interesting to see how you can make a movie practically penniless. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.
