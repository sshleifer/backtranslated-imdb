"Fate" takes Walter Sparrow to possess a mysterious novel that has similarities and connections to his life, all around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must discover his connection to the book. and how the story will end. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it had a lot of potential. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of silly sequences and a laughable dialogue that ended the humor of the film. It seemed that the scriptwriter had a good idea, he just did not know how to develop it to stretch for ninety minutes of the race. The second half of the movie was running out of ideas, the spin was pretty obvious and the ending was horrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies in history and redeemed himself a bit with Phone Booth and some other movies, but The Number 23 reminds me that he is still able to make a bad smell . He has the movie soaked in style but can not get a good focus. Move the film at a slow and clumsy pace. It changes from reality to what is really happening in the book, which quickly became annoying. The real book in the movie called "The Number 23" is a terrible detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey tell it, which bored me to tears. When Carrey finally ends up with the book, we get stuck watching her running trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We are eagerly waiting for the film to reach its horrible ending and its unconvincing explanation before the film is finally over. <br /> <br /> The performance was mostly average and quite forgettable. Jim Carrey clearly was alone as a sleepwalker through his performance and did not even seem to be trying. Either it was completely over on some scenes or it was just very wooden. His narration was completely boring to listen and did not put life into his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she needs to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty soft like Danny Huston. In general, The Number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more laughter than suspense or emotions. Rating 3/10
