As several posters have "hinted", this is a regrettable "Star Wars" scam. Now, if you're going to steal "Star Wars," at least do it right; "Battlestar Galactica" did it, and there were some other space operas that did not do a bad job, but it's definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, the youth leader, is not really that bad, although he exceeds the "cute" factor from time to time. Vince Edwards has not improved much as an actor since his "Ben Casey" days; In any case, it is even more of wood than ten years. The other performances are not anything special either. Worse still are the special effects; The best you can say about them is that they are lousy. It is most obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a bit of foam or latex, and the "battle" scenes between the Edwards raiders and the aliens are badly organized and badly shot. A very weak effort by Roger Corman. Skip it.
