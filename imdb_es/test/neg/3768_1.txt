There is a phrase from experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky, who says that some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog that goes down an alley, sniffing everything along the way. <br /> <br /> This is how the movie is. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a baby, then he became a child, then a young man, then a film director, then he started doing 'masterpieces', then he got old, The End." The word "masterpiece" is used a lot in this movie to describe Kurosawa's production, without explaining * what * makes his films so good / excellent. The fact that the off-screen narrator who reads a script says that a movie is a masterpiece, should we kiss its backside and accept that a certain film is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? And one more point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice, when extracts from the director's memoirs are read off-screen. It brings shakespeare tones in the form of pear to the text ... but why him? If you were making a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as her voice?
