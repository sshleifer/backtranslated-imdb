A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create werewolves of American soldiers to fight against the Nazis, but he is marked as crazy. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", he has no idea what is happening, only that he is the dream. The victims begin to accumulate (including a small girl, which modern viewers may find quite disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals). There is a good dialogue about how man should not mess with nature (still prevails today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are very questionable. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetically kind to Strange, but who has no idea of ​​his father's deeds. Johnny Downs is a reporter who takes the wrong side of Zucco by questioning him, but he wins Nagel's heart, creating the usual and always boring romantic subplot in classic horror movies. At 77 minutes, this is about 15 minutes longer than normal for a horror movie from the early 40's (particularly one from PRC, which released this one), so the romantic story could have been cut by costs and speed up a little things. . Zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; He left that to Bela Lugosi (who always got angry in a deliciously theatrical way that brought him to the public) and the British Todd Slaughter. But try not to think about the "The Monster Bride" lab while you look at the one that Zucco works on, or at some of Lugosi's dialogues in that now classic cult movie. "Crazy Monster" lacks a cult that follows more because it is not deliciously bad, it just has a boring rhythm in more than a few points. For lovers of PRC and Monogram, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" higher than this
