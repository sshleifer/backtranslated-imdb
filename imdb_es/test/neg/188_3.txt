Delicious Candace Bergen as a primitive Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as a diabolic desert Sheik! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the ways !!! The earthy and primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to tame a fragile and elegant beauty like Candace, is. . . Well, disappointing on paper. That's because, instead of having a dialogue about real problems ("you're a woman ... I'm a man!") You have to babble nonsense about "Allah's will" and "the wind blows fate through the sands of the desert. "John Milius, a director known more for the cult of naked male bodies and brute military force than any knowledge (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has an angry way of getting away from his desert lovers whenever it seems that Candace could be kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, they invite us to interminable (and I mean ENDLESS) the shots of Brian Keith showing his walrus pickers and delivering brave sermons about the joy of Be Teddy Roosevelt I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but seeing him try his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a great bear just does not excite me as the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have done. . . If it had ever started! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time building characters and lines of history that have no resolution. Candace's two little boys in the story have more screen time than her. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle, in any of the things that happen to him in the desert. Unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping on horseback, your hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in the story is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter. from a deep sleep on soft cushions and says, "we must escape". The girl turns around and, without losing the rhythm, responds: "But mom, I was sleeping!" That one line summarizes what is really missing in the story. There is no danger, suspense or spark in the line of the basic story, of a lady cultivated in captivity. She (and her children) are so comfortable and so well cared for that it is hard to believe that someone is worried about their destiny. <br /> <br /> Look, if Candace had said the phrase, it could have worked better. . If the tension came from his enjoyment of his captivity (or his delight in being in the arms of Sean Connery) and his guilt over all the problems caused by his kidnapping, then the story would have had some tension. But Milius has the strange assumption that the audience is as nervous as he is, since Teddy Roosevelt will have the opportunity to prove his virility three thousand miles away. In the end, the beautiful lady and her children do not seem to care about anything. . . and since they are at the center of the story, everything seems quite dry and endless. . . like the fiery sands of the desert.
