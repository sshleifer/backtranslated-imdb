I came across this supposed "horror" movie, on a Friday night, I wish I had gone to bed! Tell me ... Is it supposed that a twerp dressed in a 3-foot-high raincoat on a gurly bicycle should convey some kind of fear? Not here, however, Mi-low can still beat the crap of the janitor (Antonio Fargas), which is three times its size (?) Uh-huh. And the ending is so pitiful ... it just leaves you hanging with nothing to continue! I found myself asking: "Is that all?" <br /> <br /> Acting is as good as it will look in a low budget movie. The mentioned Fargas offers a decent performance; But my conclusion is that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worst actresses ever to be presented in Tinsel Town! Sure, pretty face, but bad acting. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
