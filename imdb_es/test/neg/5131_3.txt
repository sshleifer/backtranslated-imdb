This movie obviously had good intentions. In the end, there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who, as a spectator, can only assume that she found herself in a situation similar to the one described in the film. Maybe she made the "wrong" choice. That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love and Suicide. <br /> <br /> The film becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already irritated only in about five minutes of the movie, after that it will go downhill ... and so it was. I know that the movie was low budget and the camera shots were pretty good ... unfortunately, everything else was horrible. The performance, the plot, the quality of the sound, the quality of the image ... the performance. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond the horrible. It is as if the actors tried to act as acting people. That is the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched, I actually imagined the script with the direction of the stage in my mind. None of the movements was natural and none of the reactions of the characters fit. In summary: time is WAY off. The time of the whole movie is very far. I am not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I feel that SOME way to transmit the passage of time ... until they explained to me that the graduation was not far away, I had the impression that the first part of the The film was held over the course of a week ... a month at the most. <br /> <br /> All this said, it's really a shame. This movie could really have been powerful with a little adjustment. All the moments of the movie in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious, but only because the configuration is obvious (which is a bad thing). The scenes in movement were totally flat. For example, when Kaye's brother takes his hat from his head and puts it on top of hers, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protection of his brother's love ... in some way, simply it does not follow from that. path. There are many more scenes like this one (for example: ALL the fight scenes) and all they do is take the film. All these things together, Love & Suicide comes out as a long, cheesy and low budget commercial.
