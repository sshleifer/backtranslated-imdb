Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue advertising agency being taken by blacks. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However, it is even worse than its white predecessors. That is almost as original as it is possible. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this was considered bold and shocking in 1969, but today it seems silly. The jokes are not fun (the president is a dwarf, HOW funny?), Cruel or obvious and the movie is full of unpleasant characters. It's done in a very experimental way that makes it even harder to take ... or understand. The film becomes more bizarre and surreal as it progresses. The end comes out of nowhere. To make matters worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in this type of movie) is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright colors) ARE fun and there is a rare rare line here and there. I heard that this was a cult classic, but this is more interesting than good. Skip ... unless you're in experimental films from the sixties.
