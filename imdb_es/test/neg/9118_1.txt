American Graffiti is one of the best films that have been made. I've seen it at least 30 times and it affects me emotionally every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962). <br /> <br /> However, More American Graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that anyone associated with the Great Original Movie was involved with this terrible sequel. The part of the film set in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I was 18 months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division). <br /> <br /> The whole movie had no value anywhere in it. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to defend a case Against making big movie sequels, More American Graffiti would be the best example of what can go wrong.
