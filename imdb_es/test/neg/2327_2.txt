If you do not like the bad acting, the bad editing, the ridiculous dialogue and the incredible characters, you will hate this movie. If you like all the above, that is, if you are a Lynch fan, then you will love Mulholland Drive. This is possibly the worst movie rated above a 7.0 in IMDB. <br /> <br /> Outside the work of Naomi Watts, it will be difficult to find any competent performance in Mulholland Dr. The other protagonist was for the acting school "hide your face with your hands when you do not have the chops". Taking into account the script with which they had to work, it is a wonder that all the actors did not have their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> The characters enter and leave the film who do nothing to advance the story. You have a hired killer, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and his billiard-loving clich√©, a mafia-like figure sitting in a dark room who speaks through an external voice box and a multitude of others too numerous and tedious to to mention. Suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill screen time. <br /> <br /> However, this is not so bad because it distracts the viewer from the fact that the film does not have a discernible plot. You will wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together and in the end you will feel absolutely disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to put everything together credibly at the end of a movie in a way that makes everyone feel satisfied. The easiest thing a writer can do is create many strange characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the film as a whole and then take the few coherent threads that exist and put them together in the end for the sake of surprise. Guess which way Lynch is going? SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad script when you have to resort to sequences of dreams to make some sense. After all, a dream sequence covers all sins. Dreams do not have to make sense. Anything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> The edition is equally disjointed. Let's say that a good edition does not draw attention to itself. Much of the way this film is edited seems to be done with the sole purpose of drawing attention to the issue. "Look at me ... You can see my edition ... I'm not a genius?" Uh, well ... NO! This film has all the characteristics of the worst and most indulgent French films. <br /> <br /> So, why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is just another sign of the decline of our culture. The melodies are difficult to compose, so let's listen to rap. The plots are difficult to follow, so let's ignore them. The images are difficult to paint, so let's pee in a cup and stick a crucifix on it. These are the symptoms of our times and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the affliction.
