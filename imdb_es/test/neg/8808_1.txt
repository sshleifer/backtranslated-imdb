There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even worse. The mountain is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply bad at all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I can not begin to understand how that garbage came to the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Saw is riddled. With hole pattern. The beginning is attractive and leaves a lot to be expected, but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The movie is not creative and it will not leave you with a bit of credibility. People who claim that this film is bloody, violent, sadistic and fearful are some ladybugs that have nightmares after watching CSI because it is far from that. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I warn you not to try to see them. this if you have any form of intellect, because you will be disappointed. A real hole and a mediocre movie as it may be.
