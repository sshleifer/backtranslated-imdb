I do not know what this movie about the Chasidik movement was about. I saw this movie a year ago. Am I an Orthodox woman, who lives in an orthodox Hasidic? community And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It is very far from reality, it is scary! The director could at least hire a Chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" film about ultra-Orthodox! For example, Davening de Meir (morning prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding, or the customs of Mikveh (ritual bath). <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with technical inaccuracies ... but they are not the ones that bothered me. It is the spiritual side. The Orthodox are portrayed together with the Taliban. Women are impotent, while men are the supreme rulers! Please! No one can force a Jewish girl to Chuppa against her will! We, the Orthodox, also, live in accordance with the law (Halacha) that clearly establishes the responsibilities of man towards his wife. No hits or violations, too! And no man (not even the rabbi) can reach the woman in Mikveh. And Balanit is not placing a hand on the woman's head, while she is taking a ritual bath, the idea is to submerge the whole body at once! The director was clearly trying to hit the ultra orthodox! But could I do it at least in a pleasant and more educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Cute ! But not credible. The dialogues are long and boring. The end stank completely. Despite all that drama, at least I expected a pleasant ending, for everything I felt I felt I deserved it. Obviously, someone was trying to make a good conscience film for less observant Jews, or for non-Jews, maybe ... (look at those fundamentalists, they are so mean and mean ...) and they succeed! In short: I expected a good Europien film (Kane level), instead, I had a hitting tradition, not realistic and wrongly guiding the garbage. I mean, today, we live in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. Meir made his. Many people with a non-observer background are choosing Orthodox Judaism these days. Because, in this crazy world, religion could be a good doorway!
