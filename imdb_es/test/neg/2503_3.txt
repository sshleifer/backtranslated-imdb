Wow. I felt I needed to shower after seeing this, but maybe there are other reasons why I will leave your imagination behind. I felt used and abused after teasing, I mean to see this movie. Hairy chests, thick mustaches, and well, all hairy describes this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can not call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without hair. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, this bites. But as a piece of exploitation / porn of the rich film history of Italy, definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish I had English very badly nicknamed, I think it would have increased the negligence factor that already existed. The only white man to lie down in the movie is "Mark Shannon": he is the mustache, the chubby piece of hairy torso that really tries to give a performance every time he "gets close to the bat". This was at the end of an era in which pornographers tried to do something artistic. Nothing like filming the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man who has sex with a doggie-style woman. I can not help laughing. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that I pray to my future wife and my children who never meet.
