Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a cop with a history of aggressive criminals, is recruited into an elite clandestine division of LAPD. This does not sit well with the girlfriend of Jeff's journalist Kelly (Chelsea Field) who is looking for a story on the team. Very soon, Jeff's conscience gets better than him, which puts him at odds with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "The Red October Hunt" and "Backdraft"), the unit's leader. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty routine, dare I say mundane, police action / drama that has no surprises thanks to a cookie cutter plot that is content to go strictly from point A to point B. The acting is fine for what the actors were given to work with. However, with that there is no real reason to watch the movie. Something sad to see that the six previous films directed by Mark L. Lester just before this (from Class of 1984 to Showdown in Little Tokyo) were very entertaining vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Chelsea Field briefly topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
