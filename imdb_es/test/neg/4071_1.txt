Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A perfectly good piece like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing but embarrassing embarrassment coming out of his mouth. I shrunk 95% of the dialogue! It would have been better to silence the character! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function surpasses me! If the character of Michale Pare preceded or finished just one more sentence with the word "Men", I think I would have thrown the iron to the TV (I love doing multiple tasks, especially to overcome bad movies). It must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. Washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now. And the bad guy ... if it was that bad, why did not he shoot all the rich university students instead of promising the toilets? Even the title was an inappropriate name. A 'hard landing' means that the plane really crashes and does not just land without even a token or no one injured. Instead of landing safely, the plane should have crashed and burned like the script. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!
