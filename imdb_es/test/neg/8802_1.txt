This movie is bad, so bad that my mother, who can barely stand the "suspense" of Disney White Snow, laughed out loud throughout the film. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 container in Wal-mart. But I've actually found some good movies in that container, so I can not blame anyone for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the teller hung the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Once again, I've never been someone who ignores the cheap ones. This movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch, and it certainly is not for everyone who enjoys the occasional bad movie. If you need background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, then get this, but if you're looking for something to watch, do not get upset. It was really disappointing because there were many good actors. I felt like I was watching a chocolate version of Willard.
