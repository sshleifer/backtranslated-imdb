Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not think there is a brilliant career for the director of this inept and tedious work of looking at the navel. While it is good to see a British director trying to get out of the confines of the convention, AKA's only claim to innovative fame is based on the novelty of the triple screen. At first, you think this might be an interesting device, but your only real contribution to the movie is to test your eyesight and your patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a two-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which, of course, is very hard to do), then you have to deal with the script without hilarious grace. Chiche hits the public to submit to submission on the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. In short: the new clothes of the emperor. And a pretty poor suit, too.
