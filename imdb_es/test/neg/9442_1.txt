I can not believe that someone is giving a good rating to this movie. In addition to the line of the plot that acts in a terrible, thin (does not exist?) And slow pace, this would be the movie to see if you really tried to fall asleep. The brains of the writer and the director must have been fried eggs to have invented something as abominable as this one. Based on the plot summary of the DVD case, the premise really looked promising. But in the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a REAL idea of ​​area 51, see the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon fade away like all the pathetic movies of its kind do. FOLLOWING!!!
