I flipped through the television and saw that I was in The Secret Life of; It gave George Duran the opportunity to be the host. I know Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that no one could be as much as he was, but George was very bored. He really did not seem to want to be a host; their voices were monotonous, they did not get involved with the guests. It seemed he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and it turned out he was in the shot. I do not know if George is going to be "better" as host of this program, I doubt it because now he has presented his own program. The show seemed to pack more information, but only because we saw the host less. The formula of this program was very delicate, and I fear that now it has been interrupted forever.
