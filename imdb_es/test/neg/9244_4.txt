Korine has established himself, at this point, as a talented and impressive creator of images. All of Mister Lonely's promotional posters include the most impressive compositions in the film (although there is one in particular that I have not yet seen in promotional material: that of a nun dressed in blue mocking a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pours down). The first images of this film, of Michael Jackson (Diego Luna) riding a small motorcycle on a track, are strangely attractive and beautiful: "Mister Lonely" by Roy Orbison plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow motion . There is also a funny and terrifying sequence in which the same character pampers a dance, without music (although a radio feels like a silent dog at his side), in the middle of a street in Paris; Korine's splices in sound effects and jump cuts that evoke a feeling of uselessness and a stubborn release in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely moving; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest who is about to fly with some nuns and throw food into nearby impoverished areas. In a scene that is both cheerful and moving, Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wants to make the plane trip with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog takes a confession from the man: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife leaving him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, gains a particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on the set when Korine and company. they were filming, and their adulterous forms had given him, in real life, a lasting and overwhelming guilt. <br /> <br /> From here on out, the movie is unpredictable; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add up to a frivolous and confusing narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frames, Mr. Lonely feels like a victim of the cruelty of the editing room. Some scenes of the film were cut, that otherwise would have painted more complete images of certain characters, due to mistakes of continuity in the clothes, a result, without a doubt, due to the absence of a script of film and the tendency of improvisation of Korine. A particular deleted scene, in which 'Charlie Chaplin' (Denis Lavant) and 'Madonna' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later in the movie (I will not spoil it, but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half successful). <br /> <br /> The two narrative lines, literally disconnected, are best approached as two completely different stories. with the same allegorical meaning; one complements the other and vice versa. (It's something to do with the conflict between personal ambitions and the reality of the current situation). But there are not enough Herzog scenes to deserve their place in the movie, so any connection between these two allegorically connected threads is inevitably tense. - and, in retrospect, inclusion is tedious. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward by Julien Donkey-Boy who suffers mainly, at least in similar segments, from having too many characters for the film. career length, a flaw that would have been even worse if the names of big stars had played at all (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many of the self-contained beauties of the images and moments of real and genuine connection with the soundtrack, this seems like it would be much more suitable for an art installation or a photographic exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of the personification, I would lose nothing of its power, in fact, for me, it might be more impressive. The loneliness associated with the iconic performativity (as found by the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well captured in images such as 'Marilyn Monroe' (a beautiful Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a seven-year-old pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) is installed, after the dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera that looks towards an incredible and calm lake. <br /> <br /> As it is, moments like these, and all those in which the titles of those chosen at random Michael Jackson's songs crawl through the scene, are married to each other in a narrative of movie much less shocking than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith during the egg singing scene, late.) You will know what scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, like a kind of deceptive attempt at the new language cinematic for which Korine has been acclaimed previously.
