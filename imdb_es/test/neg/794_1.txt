THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. The truly disappointing adaptation of the sci-fi chiller of genre genre legend Richard Matheson "Button, Button" by the maddening filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly extends a small, well-made piece in a handbag 'WTF'-a-thon ! The mysterious (and ridiculously mutilated) man, Langella, proposes a million-dollar offer to the "distressed" couple, Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly with a smooth taste to the hilt!): A box with a red button, that when pressed, it will kill some stranger in the world (!) Of course the strings are united, but does that really matter here? What it does is why, in the name of God, Kelly makes paddles with such rarity (ie, nosebleeds, aqueous transport systems, that's right, transportation systems, water transport systems) when tension must be tensed as tense as possible (oh possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you have half the reason (the 80's TV reboot actually made a decent adaptation on the small screen - in fact, instead!) One of the Worst movies of the year.
