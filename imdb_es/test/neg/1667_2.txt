Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and nobody can play Woodroe F. Flame better than him. Not only was he the first and the best, but he was the only person who could portray his pain and confusion. It was a bad disappointment and I'm surprised that he even made me see it. I can even begin with how unfortunate they made Woodroe. I understand that by then he would be old, but everyone knows that he will NEVER let him throw. The first movie was the best and the only one I will ever see. I hope to God that there are no more directors planning to continue or remake the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, movies are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE ANOTHER LONESOME WORD MOVIE OF ANY KIND, take mine and billions of other people, do not waste time. To continue with the films is simply to grind the first one on the ground. Thank you.
