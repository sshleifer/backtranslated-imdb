After three hours in the movie theater, the strongest impression was that something was wrong. What was clear was that the directors forgot to direct, the actors who acted and, most importantly, the screenwriter who wrote. Evervbody screamed for no reason and shuddered. The script went on and on with many avoidable twists and turns that end now, Priyadarshan's theory of converging actors, too familiar on one point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama, but somehow managed to irritate this time, as well as the habit of the inability of each actor to answer the questions directly. The simplest questions, such as "What is your name would be repeated N times"? <br /> <br /> Finally, what was wrong was that the director forgot that his audience has something called intelligence.
