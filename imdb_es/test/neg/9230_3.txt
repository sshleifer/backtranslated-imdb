People call a "party line" to 976 to talk dirty to strangers, and maybe get together for a sexual liaison. A deranged sister, something incestuous and an occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they do not discriminate! A couple of sixteen-year-old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a nanny for a married man who is good for her (or anyone). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a vice president is taken for a homicide when he is the first to discover one of the brothers' victims. He partnered with a female assistant district attorney. <br /> <br /> Nothing very special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo as chief of police. One of the girls of sixteen years of dirty speech is played by an actress who also expressed the character of Peanuts Peppermint Patty. According to the IMDb, the other died quite young, only several years after this movie: sad.
