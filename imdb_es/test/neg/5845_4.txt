This story had the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice of love over money and anguish and repentance of having made the mistake. However, the film was ruined by the horrible mistreatment of Robert Redford as the villain offering $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. As Redford has to pay for it. Redford's youthful appearance and all-American charm simply do not cut him off as an unpleasant and threatening jerk. Redford's acting skills are insufficient to make his character threatening. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. Okay, says the lady, but you'll have to give me some time to raise the money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect like the sleazeball.
