This is not even animated enough to be fun. Something is out there, swindling people (off the screen) after a fall from the spacecraft (off the screen) while government executives investigate (off the screen) and bad actors say stupid lines (in screen), including a guy who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when it finally shows up, looks like an extra "Robot Monster", but there's not enough monster anyway. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's pretty short. Skip, unless you want to get bored of your skull with this.
