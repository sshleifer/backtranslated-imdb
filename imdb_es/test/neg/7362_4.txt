See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart was beating faster, when the hair on my neck started to stand up, when my muscles began to tense ... but just like in a strip tease, I was left without any real action, without resolution and penniless. my wallet. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores do not know the correct recipe to make a horror movie and, as such, they used the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot. <br /> <br /> This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser, all in one. Incredible, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can try each of them, they just do not mix well. I will not go to the list of all the wrong things with this movie; In short, good cinematography, mediocre performance, worse dialogue. <br /> <br /> The problem -real- with the theft of so many movie plots and their combination in a movie, apart from the resulting confusion, is while you CAN have several plots that run at the same time, you can not have several endings And what does Jaume do when he encounters this problem? Like a freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses: "The little car disappeared in the dark and ... THE END" Oooh, creepy. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist, and Hellraiser. Take care of your pants, have fun and forget that The Darkness once existed. <br /> <br /> -Bjamin
