There are places for political comments in the movie, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough from Newsweek and all the other newspaper editorials. Now I have to see this in horror movies? Let's go! All I wanted was a good zombie movie, not another "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go to Air America. And if you must insist on making a "message" movie, be a bit more cunning about it. This had all the hint of being slapped with a dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the voting bloc on the left to associate with brain-dead zombies? You may want to think about that before making another political horror movie (God help us).
