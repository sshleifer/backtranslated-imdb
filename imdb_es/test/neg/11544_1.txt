You do not have to spend a lot of time watching this TV movie or serial pilot, or whatever it was meant to be, to find out what's in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the beginning. Seriously, if this is not the worst topic I've heard, I certainly do not remember it. While acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is invented, full of insipid stereotypes and an obvious scam by Ken Kesey. Why should Hollywood always present stories from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all one-dimensional imbeciles? It is a pity that such an interesting era in our exceptionally conformist social experience is usually represented by garbage, so the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes close to the way it really was. things. . The best thing I've seen to date is a memory called Looking back on a guy named Becker, but who else has heard of it? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They are too busy pushing corns like this moan of a movie to bother reality.
