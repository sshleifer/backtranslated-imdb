This movie lacked many areas. It is about this type of Elvis that handles cars and is approached by these BIKERS of SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they beat the university students for fun. They want Elvis's boy to be his "driver". Sometimes, I wanted the people of MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was really good. Of course, there was violence and many cheesy lines, such as "What kind of beer do you want? A COLD". That was corny. The guy who plays Banjo is a great boxer and I was glad to see him do some fight scenes. In addition, the motorcyclist named FATS had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket. That was pretty bold if I had to say it myself.
