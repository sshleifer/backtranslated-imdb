On Halloween a city is terrorized by a lunatic with a large pumpkin per head. The bad performance compromised mainly with the local talent and the special effects of laughter make this a baaaaad. The queen of movie B, Linnea Quigley, seems embarrassed to be a part of it, and even her considerable charm, which has helped many of her other films, can not help her. Pass this cheesy movie if you are looking for a good Halloween horror movie and rent "The Night of the Demons", which also stars Mrs. Quigley.
