WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PARCEL SPOILERS, AS IF POSSIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, if you have not discovered the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples go to a camping spot, but a masked assassin of clowns appears that causes all kinds of chaos. <br /> <br /> Now is the time to give these couples advice. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, never go to the camp called Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Do not have sex or kiss in front of the murderer. 3. Do not go after the killer if he or she runs away. 4. Do not shout blasphemies to the murderer. 5. Make sure your cell phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone needs to carry a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it with them all the time. 7. Wear loose, comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and tied clothing and no heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them to avoid stabbing the wrong person. 9. Always carry the car keys with you. 10. Put out a fire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your steps. If you stumble on something, you're going to break a bone. 12. Check the back seat for uninvited guesses. 13. If the murderer has cornered you, at least opt ​​for a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but generally the four main characters break all these rules of common sense. They are the dumbest characters in history. <br /> <br /> Now, for some brief comments. This movie slasher had a very tight budget. Therefore, four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. The performance, the writing, the direction, the sound, the lighting, the work of the camera, the layout, the editing, etc., are at the end of the line. But just like the classic movie JACK O, this works in such poor quality, it's a very entertaining and fun level. So rent this and have a good time and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
