This movie is hilarious, what's better than watching two creatures fight each other? GIANT cgi versions of these fighting beasts! However, I do need one of the weapons used in the film. Because apparently they are using traps. Count the number of shots you use before you have to ... oh, wait, that's right, you never have to recharge. Regardless, count the shots ... it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film for the Komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. Oh, and I forgot to mention that, apparently, these Komodo dragons GIANTS are so stealthy? Because somehow, even when the actors look in the direction from which the beast comes, they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> Every time someone dies, you can see what is coming because everyone is prepared for it, they put their arms. Up in the air and shoot them to save yourself ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The last jewel is that the brains of these writers are just a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" such as these two creatures are amphibious to comments like "helpless animals", they are full of fun facts.
