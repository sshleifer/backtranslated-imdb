Horrific "comedy" in which a beautiful and crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a hit man (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What is happening to the comedy? The year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies in history (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is not one, I repeat, there is NOT a funny moment in it. The jokes are stupid, not funny, malicious or very sick. There is also a strong hatred towards women in this garbage: the only main female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sexual object. Also extreme, bloody violence is thrown at the end. The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles, both psychopaths. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser have reached their lowest point of all time with this: the only way to move forward is through an account. And poor Tyler! Did you stop making intelligent and brave independent films for THIS? AND DOUGLAS ???? What was he when he agreed to this? A complete piece of trash - which should be avoided AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!
