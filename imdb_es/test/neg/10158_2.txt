This is a jerk. The crime scene, which dates back to 1949, is often interpreted more as a Coen Bros. movie set in the 1940s and shot in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche here is not so well tuned. seen instead as the forerunner of an Oscar stupid like Road to Perdition. Frankly, it's a wonder that this film is not considered a classic by professors and film critics from around the world, considering how much it offers in terms of too articulate Mannerist emotions wrapped in false meaning (like the grandfather of all those "fake art" movies, Citizen Kane, or anything from Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can not do anything wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, any environment, even "harsh realism" can only benefit from grotesque aesthetic anesthesia. You could say that I am a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a certain light touch to write a dialogue of hard men with Dashiell Hammett's band, a willingness, perhaps, to let in perhaps one or two scenes without a line like "Look out, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen Fish for frying and there are no small worms to catch them. " I invented most of that: "Mr. Wiggly", unfortunately, I made the cut, but believe me, the dialogue is just inflated and plagued by no minions. Even the main cop's wife played by Arlene Dahl speaks as if she had a moon-shaped scar under one eye and Rocco's Christian name. By the time Van Johnson delivers his plaque with the phrase, "I'm sick of death and murder," he'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary embellishments (in this case, zeugma) could have ever had. It has been misinterpreted as "street". <br /> <br /> For those who have passed the series The Naked Gun, this is the funniest movie of cops and thieves.
