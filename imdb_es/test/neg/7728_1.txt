I have not had the opportunity to see the previous movie, but from what I have read in other publications it was supposedly worse than this, although I doubt it is possible. I am a big fan of the genre "Zombie", and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of seeing creatures, which for all intents and purposes are human, like an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head. That said, HOTD 2 brings the movie "Zombie" to a new minimum. <br /> <br /> Without giving any great spoilers (what you really should do to not bother wasting your time watching this movie)) I would like to express my total disregard for the way the writers of this film portray to the special forces of our countries. Gomer Pile could probably have survived longer than the "Spec Ops" soldiers in this movie. For shouting out loud they should have called them Special Education Forces instead. If you're going to write a script that sends an elite team to deal with a zombie outbreak, at least make the soldiers smarter than the walking corpses. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do that than have your machine guns down and walk to put a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling madman rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark and creepy basement. <br /> <br /> The writers actually try to take the whole zombie issue to a more technological level by turning it into a virus for which they are looking for a vaccine, and the idea has merit, if it did not get stuck in between of such a ridiculous exhibition of rebellious films. I mean, come on, zombie movies are not exactly a "great art", and the viewer expects some ironic cheesiness along with gore and emotion, but HOTD 2 is the kind of cheese that makes you turn the channel with disgust . and amazement of the pure stupidity of the characters. If you are a fan of zombie movies like me, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
