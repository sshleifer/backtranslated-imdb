This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. And I've seen many movies. My friends and I rented this Wednesday night. Man we have a lot of fun. This movie is the worst boring shit I've ever seen. But it makes you laugh! You will lie on the ground rolling trying to take some air. You ask why rent it and check the girl who plays the keyboard in that bad quality Russian bar. My mother would make a film 1000 times better about her feeding in cats.
