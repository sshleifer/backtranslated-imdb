I saw this movie while I was browsing infomercials and nighttime comedies from the 80s on television one night at 2 in the morning. I must say that I did not expect much and I did not receive much. Although Rose McGowan is good, her performance and that of the rest of the cast were not worthy of an Oscar, to say the least. This movie has its ups and downs, and it has a couple of nice twists at the end, but in all honesty it was horrible. Not even a typical slasher movie. Without gore, without sex, without nudity, without real violence. Only bad acting. I would give it a 3 out of 10.
