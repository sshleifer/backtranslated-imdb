"The Vindicator" is a strange and small Canadian B movie. At first glance, it would seem to be just another cheap (extremely cheap) imitation of "Terminator", but, oddly enough, it also shares some qualities with the original "RoboCop", which had not yet been released when "Vindicator" appeared (1986). ). Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story goes like this: the scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a very nice guy who works for a high tech research laboratory of the super duper secret government, informing a shoddy boss called Whyte, to whom he heads the funding of projects at the beginning of the movie. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes him even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "laboratory accident". But wait! Carl is not really dead after all! Whyte extracted Carl's brain and inserted it into his favorite project, a kind of experimental bio-mechanical space suit. When Carl wakes up inside his new body, he understandably goes crazy, destroys the lab and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a "Reaction of Anger" program, which will cause Carl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In retrospect, that little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. <br /> <br /> So Robo-Carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while, killing a couple of random muggers and other varied background characters, until he returns home and gets in touch with his wife (this scene is supposed to be touching and touching, but it's funny because Carl's robot voice is so synthesized that you can barely understand a word of what he says). He, of course, tells her to leave the city and never come back because she is in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Finally, Whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by "Hunter", an apparent ninja killer played by Pam Grier (!) To hunt down and destroy his fugitive creation, using Carl's wife as bait, and can be given a predictable (but ridiculously cheap) aspect. . <br /> <br /> I'm a type of B-Movie, but "The Vindicator" was so half-hearted that it became a great comedy quickly. I suppose a good part of the budget went to the design of Stan Winston's robo-Carl suit, because it looks really good, but the rest of the movie looks cheap and made for television. The script could have used a LOT more work, but maybe the filmmakers learned that "RoboCop" would go into production and they rushed to get "Vindicator" out so they could not be accused of scams. Either way, judging by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who has noticed the parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop", and obviously "Robo" is the top movie, so there's no need to lose time. review this nonsense unless you want to see a movie that can best be described, at best, as a "RoboCop" draft if it were made by an 8th grader.
