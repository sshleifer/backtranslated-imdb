Anyone who writes that this is good, a child may have worked on it or invested money in this horrible university experiment. It was lousy, slow and painful to watch. The run time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and a half hours. The only culprit is the director, who does not know anything about how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this terrible film was filmed by long master shots. Two or three people in the picture talking or shouting forever (or what seems to be forever), No close-ups! There are no average shots !! There are two so-called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain could shoot in the foreground or medium for them. They seemed very amateur. The scenes with the father and the son shouting at each other would have worked better if there was a cut of only the father or only the son acting or reacting. Tri-C must be very mortified to show this anywhere. I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, some of them are fun because they are so bad that this is not one of them.
