The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've found. The dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the problems facing the characters are developed at all, they are simply surface details intended to convey a point without having to create a credible dialogue to support that point. In addition, the description of Chinese characters leaves much to be desired: I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns impeccable English from a book (or that is implicit in a scene) so that he can teach it to his daughter. . Etc. <br /> <br /> The Smile Train is a great organization and it is a good idea to make a moving film about the impact that a program like this can have on children's lives, but in general, I found this The movie to be more frustrating than nothing.
