The frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a true potential for greatness, is that it almost enjoys being heavy. We talk about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is that there is no way to avoid the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character. <br /> <br /> At some point, most of us know who the people are. they are ... even if we never understand where they are going. Pure pretension wore me down every time I tried to capture a truth in this movie. <br /> <br /> Call it beautiful, great and incredible ... I just call it "cheating". All style and no substance. Of course, it is a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confused modernist pasiche of symbols and splashes on the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm in favor. Art is something personal, I suppose.
