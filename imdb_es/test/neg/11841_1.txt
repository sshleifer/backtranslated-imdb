So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the positive side was that SciFi Channel was doing a marathon of dinosaur movies that day: the trilogy "Carnosaurio", "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I turned on my cable remote to see what SciFi movie he put in his glamorous prime-time slot on Saturday. Some movie that I had never heard of before called "Raptor". I was very excited. The film begins with some teenagers driving in a jeep, when they are harassed and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, that's weird, it looks almost exactly like a scene in" Carnosaur, "except that I was in the middle of that movie." Then I sat through a very bad performance and then a guy was tricked into entering an underground research lab where he was devoured by a fierce T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait a second, that was also a scene in" Carnosaur. "Then, after I saw some scenes brazenly ripped out of" Carnosaur 2, "I realized what the hell was going on, so basically Roger Corman & Co. started scenes from the "Carnosaur" trilogy to use as action scenes, wove a basic plot of "dinosaur run-amok" and tried to pass it off as an original movie, embarrassing, I do not know who I'm more angry with, Roger Corman or SciFi Channel for trying to pass this off as something worthy of prime time, the only reason it was worth watching was when it came to choosing actors / actresses who looked like their counterparts in the trilogy. " Carnosaurus "and guess what scenes will rise next ... As much as it hurts, being a lover of dinosaurs, I have no choice but to give this the lowest possible score because I feel completely cheated.
