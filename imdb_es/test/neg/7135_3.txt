I would not deny that I really liked watching Japanese horror films, but everyone should be pretty fed up with them after having seen the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the story of Resentment. Audrey, as requested by her mother, will retrieve her sister. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. She wants to discover the truth behind the curse and then a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, something happens to a family and three girls, but it seems that they realize too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I can not see the points for the three girls of The International School will appear in the movies since they are not (very) related to the story. The reason why the woman who holds the grudge is still killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they are only saying the same things that I saw in the rancor). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the child is, without doubt, strange, which I suppose is an attempt to tell the story of the family. The killing scenes are absolutely the mix of those of Ring and Shibuya kaidan. The performance would be another bad point. Like Hong Kong, I would really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a movie lover I really can not find any point to support the bad performance. Other actors like the father, although he only appears in some scenes, should also have done it better. What stays well is the atmosphere of the movie, especially when I saw it only in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy the horror movies and have seen all the possible horror movies. Except this one, like me, you can go kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror films of this kind, you should spend some time watching the Japanese version of the Ring.
