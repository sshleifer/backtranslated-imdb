I will never return to the three hours of life that this movie has stolen from me. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I would love to know what they were in when this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It is also the most inexact film historically existing; 2001 has arrived and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place. <br /> <br /> The characters are unpleasant, the design is simplistic and everything goes without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the ending is probably the worst: it's supposed to be stimulating, but the only thought that entered my mind is "What F $ * K is going on ?!" <br /> <br /> I would say that for anyone looking for serious entertainment, AVOID this movie at all costs and choose a science fiction movie that does NOT stick on its own @ $$.
