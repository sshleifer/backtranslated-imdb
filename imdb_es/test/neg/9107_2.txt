Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who the idea of ​​this was and what dining room they're eating right now. To say that this was bad is an insult to the bad movies that we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide, I thought it would be a parody ... maybe it should have been. I could have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where you are on a plane in mid-flight with the door open and there is no wind. They could have sprung up for a fan at least. <br /> <br /> Look for several Canadian actors and the c-list in the movie. This is the kind of film that covers the b-rate cable stations you never see, except on a rainy Sunday.
