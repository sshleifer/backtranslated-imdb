As someone who loves the history of baseball, especially in the early 20th century in which Cobb was a leading figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, he was looking forward to seeing this baseball movie. Well, it was not a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was just the story of an athlete being with Cobb in the last years of the ball player, while the two collaborated on a book. Even so, this could have been a more compelling movie than they did. <br /> <br /> He admitted that Cobb was anything but a good guy, an extremely talented but brutal player in the sense that he would do anything to beat you. ... and he was viscous, intimidating and had many demons to fight. He was so hated that his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title for a year. However, this is an exaggerated representation of man. It makes it almost like a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Seeing and hearing an old man rant, rave and desecrate for two hours is entertainment? No, it is not. Someday, I'd love to see a real Cobb biopic showing him on his ball game days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, but the way they did it here with just an old blasphemer. It's not fun to look at the man who does his ass in front of a reporter.
