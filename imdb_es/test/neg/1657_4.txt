Very slow movie, boring, enigmatic. If the kind of film that Jean-Luc Godard had made would have been Italian. Certainly, it transmits how tedious, repetitive, sad and empty a person's life can be, but generally I do not go to the cinema to discover it! The plot (as it is) does not convince. Why a magnificent hotel receptionist (an exception to the monotony of the film) would be interested in the least in a fool, smoker inveterate and silent talking with "deep" aphorisms, puzzles me. Very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character. You want to shake him by the throat and tell him to "get out of there." Your brother is a much more human character. The ending is not conclusive and disconcerting. Everyone in the cinema (when I saw the movie) came out muttering about how they almost fell asleep. Of course, it should not be a 'shhot-em-up' and a 'crash-bang' party like Bruce Willis of Hollywood, but a little energy and action would have made it so much more exciting. One of the best Italian films in history? Please ... An art house, curiosity at best.
