Formula to the maximum. None of the titles reflects the actual content of the series, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is only to fill the moments of calm between the fistfights. The packaging claims more than 40 'physical encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three per chapter! Apart from seeing Duncan Renaldo interpreted as a French with a Spanish accent, to see how the furniture is overturned, broken, thrown, burned or burst, that is really what this series is about. When the protagonists begin to fight, you can bet that everything in the room will also be there. So, congratulations to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive notes: the characters sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all we have the girl's side kick (often a journalist, since she is here) participating really in chaos, especially shooting and killing the bad guys. Still, Linda Stirling is killing the main villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the downside, there are too many leaps to escape: before the slab falls, before the car travels over the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits it. hit, etc. . <br /> <br /> It is claimed that this series partially "inspired" George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but that is more due to the implicit concept than to the real story or the development of the series. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron 'shines' like a rock in motion, a role he played in all his films. Apart from seeing how all the furniture is broken, here there is nothing really compared to other series that have less fights, more stories, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 for all The shredded furniture.
