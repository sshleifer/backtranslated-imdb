The mission of seeing the movie "The cave" was the dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of the flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It is a pity that the film has not changed much more than the trailer. <br /> <br /> The immediate appeal of a movie like this is the creature. How are you going to see? Why do you live in a cave? How is this supposed to be different from the other creatures we've seen in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic? The "demons" of the cave do not look far from the skeletal creature in Alien: Resurrection and even have the Predator view. Too bad it's a total scam ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's take a look at the plot: very confusing and jump to more and more totally improbable turns when a team of cave divers is sent to look for a cave and its inhabitants in the mountains of the Carpathians. The casting was very clear: we want young girls, hips, hard, chiselled and girls who have brains must also be hot. We also have to have one of each racial origin in case the audience thinks that the filmmakers are biased towards a certain point of view. Completely done, and I'm totally tired of it. <br /> <br /> The other big problem was the end, as if to say that there could be a sequel. Plase shoot me if there is one. The label in the end made me miserable. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points they got were more or less points of appreciation towards creators of creatures for their high quality work spent on the costumes and design for the monsters that inhabit the interior, even when they were totally scammed. And there is an interesting (but laborious) documentary on the DVD about underwater cave diving. Go see it only if you love the new creations of monsters and creatures, but keep in mind that you've probably seen this movie before and that it was better the first time.
