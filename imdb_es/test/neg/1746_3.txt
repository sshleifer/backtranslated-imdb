Let's see. This movie is many things for different people. For Finns, as the comments show, it can be acceptable or terrible or boring. For other people, it may be something different. First: if you do not speak Finnish (I do), you will understand half of what is happening, since the subtitles are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly ("Paha maa" would probably translate idiomatically as Badlands in the United Kingdom English). ). <br /> <br /> Why did not I like it? Because it's a tarantino-style movie: it just takes a very hard reality and returns it to it, as brutally as possible. However, I am not an American and, therefore, I do not like this procedure very much, because all it does is show that the director has nothing new to say. Technical dexterity (the work of the camera is brilliant), the script (not so unoriginal) does not rescue this film from the bottom to which it belongs. If you want to see a Finnish film, go to one of the films of the Kaurism√§ki brothers, who combine talent and director skills, with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intention and priorities: none was intelligible, and therefore this film failed. By not looking at it you will not lose much.
