I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this Bunuel film (with some Dali ideas) left me cold. Bunuel had a lifelong bitterness against the Catholic Church and was delighted to try to offend Catholics in a rather foolish way. This is one of the dumbest; almost like what you would expect from an intelligent 18-year-old boy in film class. The last minutes of the film, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final reading of religion. <br /> <br /> If you read the "scholars" about this slow-paced and occasionally funny movie. , it is about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is really the point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most indirect way possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and hitting the blind on the street, and who mentally turns billboards into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the fault of the church (for interrupting the act of making love), or is it just an imbecile? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had many personal complications and have chosen Catholics as the culprits. <br /> <br /> There are some times when you can shout: "Aha, surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling through a window (a poor model), a man who breaks a pillow feathers, a woman who cleans a toilet while we see images of boiling lava (or a mud pit ... hard to say in B / W). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel still pursued the same bogey men for the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet charm ...). If you are interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, take a look at the initial work of Jean Cocteau.
