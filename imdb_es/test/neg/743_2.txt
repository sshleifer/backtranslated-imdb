What a horrible adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800s ?????? The only character that did not bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open in this case, and I usually love Jane Austen's films. I did not even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I do not understand very well how Catherine and Henry achieved a passionate kiss in the end, when during the film they had no chemistry or signs that they cared for each other. Isabella and her brother were exaggerated; It was no secret to me right away that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the thrill of Jane Austen's films is the discovery that who you think is good is not. It's probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
