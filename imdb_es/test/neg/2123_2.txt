A perennial accessory at the bottom of IMDb 100, seeing this is not hard to see exactly why it is shown to fail in a totally miserable way in almost all bloody departments on the move! <br /> <br /> Take the edition to start; Calling this choppy would be too complementary! In fact, if the makers of this had gotten drunk one night and cut and dice the film rolls with scissors and glue for children, the resulting disaster could hardly have been worse than what we really have here. Added to this, the insane story goes on mercilessly for what seems to be a torturous infinite before we finally reach the climax, definitely lacking in brilliance. <br /> <br /> Aside from the Michael Sopkiw game, the bad performances of most of the rest of the cast do not help either, and the real beast that is causing all the problems is something less than convincing to put it gently. Yes, really. , all this is a lot of garbage if I've ever seen one. <br /> <br /> Dear, dear ... and think that Lamberto Bava addressed this to ... tut, tut in fact. <br /> <br /> Note: This was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, although it lacked most of its bloody scenes, which ironically are the only reason why it may be worth watching.
