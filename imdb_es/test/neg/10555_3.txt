This is a widely used line, but it really sums up this movie ... "If this is the current state of gay cinema, then we are in real trouble." I saw this movie in SIFF due to the high rating of IMDb (7.6) and if there was ever a case of stacking votes in IMDb, then this is it. Just watch how the numbers fall during the premiere weeks of the movie. <br /> <br /> An easy plot ... Boy discovers that his ex (boyfriend) of high school is going to marry a friend of his, so he returns to his old hometown (still with a torch of 10 years ) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked "Last Days", the director's last feature, despite his cookie-cutter characters and his plot designs, but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release. I do not know how you get horrible supportive performances from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he did it. The writing was quality Red for life (a long time ago when they were REALLY bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortably difficult to see. I kept looking for a nonexistent remote control to move quickly, but in the end I made myself stay until the end, waiting for a decent ending. Ugh ... no. Even the free male nudity that emerged during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be fair ... the 2 tracks, especially in the free nude scenes, were beautiful. There was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship, as they discovered how they went their separate ways. And the movie looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. <br /> <br /> How is it that the television network can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes (like "Ugly Betty", "Desp Housewives", etc.), but so many releases in similar genres? Can they be as bad as this?
