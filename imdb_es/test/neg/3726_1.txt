A waste of time, talent and space on the shelves, this is a truly abysmal movie. What are the great players in the league like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd wasting time on so much crap? The little criminal Reeves shows up at his brother's wedding (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends and leaves with the girlfriend. A comedy, a thriller, a romance? Honestly I do not know! Reeves takes the lead in wood and the casting of Dan Aykroyd as a cop is so frightening that you have to see it to believe it. The only bright spot in a dark and dark tunnel is Diaz and even she is not so good. Rent something else. everyone involved in this mess should keep their heads ashamed and prey to be lost in oblivion in the coming years.
