This could have been a really good movie if someone had known how to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story went very well and it was heading towards that point in every movie like this, where the "gray" characters become "good" and the "bad" guys get their just desserts and boom * ... it's as if they had run out of a script and the cast began to do things. <br /> <br /> What I would not do 'has been so bad ... if the cast had continued with the development of the character he had already implemented. But that is not the case and the movie will soon become a ridiculous disaster. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie until the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point, imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the ending you find will look much better than the way this movie really ends. . Trust me in this.
