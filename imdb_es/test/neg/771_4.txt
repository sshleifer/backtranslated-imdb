Someone else called this movie a "fable-horror" movie, and I think it fits pretty well. That is the concept at least. A group of teenagers, each with their own vice, catches the attention of a twisted thief of artists. He decides to teach teens a lesson by making them part of a freak show. A great idea, but it could have been executed better. The fate for some of the teens is too obvious, while other characters may have developed further. Also, the ending was a serious disappointment. There is no resolution or big spin or anything. <br /> <br /> But like a low-budget horror movie, it's quite fun to watch it. If you like corny spookfests, you should laugh watching this one. I think one of his faults, however ... is that he takes himself too seriously. It's a silly movie, and if I was a little more self-conscious, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough ordered carnival themes and movie monster makeup to keep you watching.
