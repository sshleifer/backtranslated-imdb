In general, all this sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm just Tarantino's biggest fan (and * I'll try * not to lean over to call him 'hack' ... which is pretty hard). I do not like to tease or criticize a movie before seeing it. So, with cautious caution, today I walked to the cinema to watch 'Inglorious Basterds' <br /> <br /> Now, calling it "a scam of a scam" would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title of Enzo Castellari's Dirty Dozen clone (less than spectacular), but it's not about plot points (which he takes from all other genres of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his long interrogation against A farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is an anti-climax, in that, the dialogue is obsolete and the result signaled a mile away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews escapes (but more of it later) We (the public, obviously, we are pleased) are treated with the introduction of Lieutenant Aldo Raine (ha ha, that name almost sounds like a movie B) ) the king ALDO RAY .... ha-ha Quentin ... continues with those 'tributes' and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was the only good thing he's starred in) and with Open mouth, Mr. Jolie treats us with a Nazi murderer huddled and huddled from the south. Meanwhile, Mr. Tarantino forgets that real adults may be present, so do you assume that teenagers will not have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'? <br /> <br /> The "platoon" of Raines consists of (John Cassavettes looking for) Jewish soldiers thirsty for blood, all seeking to obtain the great reward of Adolf Hitler. Tarantino, in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by choosing his longtime best friend (and fellow sycophant-honcho) Eli Roth (like the baseball bat that held 'Bear Jew'). The other man's name is Hugo Stiglitz. (and I'll bet that more than half of QT fans had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you have achieved 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and can detract from the plot (or lack of it?) <br /> <br /> Anyway, shortening a long (and extremely boring and prolonged) story, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the only survivor of chapter one, both have separate plans to kill Hitler in the screening of a Nazi propaganda film, in a French cinema (owned by the survivor mentioned above, who is now an adult) <br /> <br /> More boring (and meaningless) conversations follow two from one side to another, while Pitt assaults the attention of an audience. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the deadliest tyrant of all time, is scrapped by the directors' insistence on placing a song by David Bowie in the 1980s in a World War II movie. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the recurring problem I have with most Tarantino products ... I rarely know when to start or stop. I do not need 'tribute' after 'homage' to get the * joke * (whatever it is) I knew about Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the definitive crime of the whole movie) Ennio Morricone eerie score of STIR. I go to the movies to see the stars ... if the best thing you can do is the terrible Barad Pitt, will I assume that you (Mr. Tarantino) are the main attraction here? I do not want the audience to direct the film. Pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity ... NOT how you can patch (over and over again) endless scenes of endless movies. It's time for fans (in IMDb) to employ a 'hard love' in your 'idol' (God knows, if not ... studies should?) <br /> <br /> The tired old discussion with the worshipers of Tarantino is "well, if you can do better ... do it" Let me tell you that if I were a director of 46 years, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has ... I want to offer YOU much more than a repetition of the best films of the Second World War that this gut. The directors he tries to emulate, made such bad movies by accident or due to budget constraints. It's an escape, again and again, to listen to your fans campaign about their lack of imagination as "art". I am sure he is able to improve (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once again ... and without mentioning the 2 and a half hours of my life ...) maybe he is not?
