What I would not do to rewrite this movie. Extraordinarily disappointing due to the great beginning, Solo Dios Sabe becomes a superstitious bull after the midpoint and ends with a note so absurd, bland and melodramatic that I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I started with. The film had numerous elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so palpable that I thought that the screen would start to light up, a great soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of ending up with the heavy-handed religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have focused on being a frothy road movie with perhaps some nuances about fate and superstition versus logic. I understand that all the director's intention with the film was to do it about religion, but the fact is that it just did not work, and from the beginning he dismissed so many great things.
