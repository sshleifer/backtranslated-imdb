I really love horror movies and I try to give everyone I see as much credit (or even more) as possible, but this is really driving the ticket ... most of the cast was very similar but almost none of them could act at all, but again think about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... a good makeup, but a ridiculous special fx absolutely ridiculous. In summary, I give it 3 out of 10, and I have doubts about it!
