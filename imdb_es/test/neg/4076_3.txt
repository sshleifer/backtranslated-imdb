If you're not an 80's fan, and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or one of the two prospects, there's nothing about this film to recommend. <br /> <br /> The story, like others I have said, is boring, almost a belated idea of ​​the basic notion of the characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I watched him for about an hour, waiting for him to turn a corner, for a turn to occur, or for somehow to get going, but no ... It's not inadmissible, it's just boring. It goes by Pasa with pieces of running crazy, footwork at strange angles, crazy screams, but I did not have a real sense of energy or manic fun, it just seemed forced. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh about either. A little fun here or there, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the mention of feminism, by the way, all it means in this case is that almost all the main cast is female. In any case, it's really cloying ... Two female bosses, well, excellent, the drug dealer is female, well, your landlord is a housewife, okay, your friends are female, well, the only other person in particular that we see that he lives in the same building, oh, woman ... I was not aware of that, but after a while I felt that a conscious decision had been made for the film to be broadcast that way and, once again I thought it was a bit forced and cloying. . <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you're a fan of fashion and culture of the '80s, there's a lot to see and if you're a Helen Slater fan, it's fun and enjoyable to watch. There is also screen time for Carol Kane, which is great, but it's not enough ... <br /> <br /> In general: 3/10. If you are a big 80s fan, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, maybe you could get to 5 because of them, although there is still the fact that it is a comedy that is not fun, which makes it substantially harder. If you're not a fan of those things, you might as well do it because there's nothing more to enjoy here.
