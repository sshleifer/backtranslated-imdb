Down in the movie gallery, I saw a movie that had to do. It seemed like a low-budget fun / action / western that I could get into. Yes, I knew it would stink, but I rented it anyway with the hope of laughing. Only a few laughs were found. This was an extremely stupid movie. Start with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of cinema. It seems / acts as if it could face Chuck Norris, but it can not. Your dialogue stinks too. Anyway, enter a town, shoot some zombies. You could say that they tried to do this longer by including these boring scenes in which it takes between 3 and 5 minutes to recharge or look at some zombies. At least the zombies look great. So, anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead, except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when four people shot him down.
