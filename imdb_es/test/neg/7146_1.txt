This movie angered me for the simple fact that it was made only because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly evil. What happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy. However, where was Hollywood when four white religious children were executed, after being forced to perform a series of sexual acts with their murderers and between them, by two evil black men in Wichita just two years ago? Celebrities only assault the camera when it has a political purpose. In addition, Laramie is portrayed in low light by this pseudo-documentary, which of course is not surprising because they are the backward hicks that must be educated by omniscient and enlightened Californians. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Laura Linney.
