Please, do not waste six hours of your life watching this as I did. The fact that I did it is not a good reflection on me. The only work of redemptive actor in this mess was Wes Studi. How a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe that Lonesome Dove surpasses me !! It was an incoherent, incoherent and incoherent story. The lines of the plot did not develop, the action scenes were almost ridiculous and the grand finale (disappointment) was an appropriate ending for this miniseries. Val Kilmer, who I have thought of as a well-known actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen. His last scene on the show had to have been a burden on the director. I have been reading these reviews for years and this program prompted me to sign up.
