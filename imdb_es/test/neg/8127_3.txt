First of all, let me say that after seeing this movie I felt that I had been sold a list of products. Keep in mind that it is not the fault of the movie that IMDb makes it listen first as a comedy and then as a horror (although I do not know how it was introduced ... maybe it was made by an imbecile of the film crew). Being a fan of the genre of comedy and horror, I checked it based on that and I'm very sorry. Where to start? First of all, to remember my beginning, there is no comedy in this movie. He tries once or twice, but in the best case he never gets more than a giggle. My reaction was mainly to roll my eyes and wonder why someone thought such tired material would be fun. Also, there is no horror here. You can not find a second of tension. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. There is no tension, very little blood and there is not much violence on the screen (I'm sorry, but in a horror movie that just came out when the good starts it's a major fault). Hell ... there are even zero nudes. Call me purist or juvenile ... I prefer some in a horror movie if you can not find an original plot / premise. And how tired as all hell "reality TV show went wrong"? It has been done before and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm ... whatever that movie is called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I do not even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the only comment that states that the moment for this was good because "reality TV is taking control". Did someone from the past publish that with a time machine? Are you kidding me? This is trash ... and not in a funny way.
