I just attended a preview of this movie. A masterpiece of documentary film that was not. Totally absorbed with his subject, the film becomes unable to level any kind of critical comment regarding Ms. Faye. Cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (though unsuccessful) to structure some kind of narrative. But the most spooky experience occurred when the final credits rolled. The audience got up and applauded. Like moths to the flames, Americans in the 21st century are still attracted to freakshows. The narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting pretty tired.
