If good intentions made a movie great, then this movie could be one of the best movies ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme, at least a significant theme, a background of the fifties, the exhaustion of the existential world, aerial scenes that should have moved the senses and imagination, and characters about which one could be deeply taken care of It is about patriotism and patriotism in a healthy way. <br /> <br /> Just ten years after the movie, I met the Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at the university They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have senses of humor. One had been a member of the crew on the first plane to launch a hydrogen bomb. I've wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I imagine they flew missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feelings and celebration of patriotism that underlines the narrative. No actress has been worse used than June Allison in this movie. Your Susan Holland is a woman who would run away, not hug. Colonel James Stewart (who as then colonel) makes a good test of this role as the Lieutenant Colonel (and later the Colonel) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does on paper is bite a sandwich. I'm not kidding. Stewart was as good as biting into sandwiches as he did in The Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> One could think of Ted Williams, but not me when I see Mr. Steward on paper. I think of William Holden as Lieutenant Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> The images taken from a B-36 look like the spoils of an airline's commercials. Although beautiful, aerial shots are mundane. For the moment, they could have impressed the viewers. The clash in Greenland involves unattractive modeling. You expect the result to be good. <br /> <br /> The low tone - the subtext - for the film expresses the tedium that Air Force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the Air Force used to do their business, business as well as any other business One imagines how a director of La Nouvelle Vague could explore this topic and then begins to think how someone with imagination could have filmed this movie. Small moments are lost. When the teams returned from long missions, the crew members were shot with scotch and massaged before reporting the mission. Show that that could have helped. <br /> <br /> The banality was the image that the Air Force wanted and Mr. Mann accommodated the officer. Maybe, in that sense, the movie works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I regret when I see the film, because I think all of us, director, actors, team, spectators and members of the film. the armed services may have enjoyed giving and obtaining much more than we received here. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie had to be Dr. Strangelove or 2001, both of which it presages, but they had potential never realized. However, I like to see it. I think of the aviators in their long missions and on the ground equipment in isolated places. A certain sense of honor is celebrated here and I celebrate that honor. <br /> <br /> I certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and elsewhere appreciate it. If there was not an intentional fallacy, I would get a 10 from me. <br /> <br />.
