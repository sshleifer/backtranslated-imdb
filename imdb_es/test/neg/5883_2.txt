I expected this to be hilarious and, at best, mediocre, the only fun character is, believe it or not, Andy Dick. The timing was horrible in most jokes and jokes and the writing was bad, I mean, I know it was supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just worked. In addition, all this genre has already been beaten to death, with all the films of Austin Power and his brother undercover, it seems old, it also looks like a scam of an undercover brother (who was not hysterical either, but much more fun than this). Also, for a comedy / action movie, the direction was somewhat bland. I do not know if this is going to be released in theaters, but it's definitely made for television.
