I'm sorry about that. But if you have seen this "epic", obviously you will know the total contempt for the real text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly next on the list for holiness, but I do know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to erase everyone from the face of the Earth because he believed that they had been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be saved because of its uncorrupted forms. Noah builds an ark according to God's instructions to house him, his family and two of each creature while he floods the rest of the planet. These are the foundations. In this film, there are other people who roam the sea, like street vendors and pirates. But I thought EVERYONE was eliminated. I guess NBC executives have never been to church. There are other inaccuracies, I am told, but like Joe average, I have no idea what they are. Sorry. Returning to the movie, it was inaccurate, as was said before, the stinking actor, but some of the effects were good, that's what I give him. But in general, I've seen a better and more elegant version of the story made as a small scene in The Simpsons. God help NBC executives reach the day of judgment. 3/10
