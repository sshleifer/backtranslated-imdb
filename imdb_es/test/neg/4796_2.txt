It did not feel like a movie, and fortunately it was short (less than 90 minutes), it felt more like a commercial of possibilities in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, no doubt. But that does not make a great movie, not even a good movie. I am not saying that it is absolutely useless to see, since it is possible to see what the possibilities are in CGI or GCI, or whatever it is called. <br /> <br /> When I read somewhere, "You can not fix it in the cut, the room", a bad story and unmanaged actors, can not be fixed in the cutting room or with the special effects anymore. magnificent. Things can be improved in the court room if they have a real director and material to work with. <br /> <br /> However, they thought that this could be sold in the US. UU It is any idea, since EE. UU They are the thieves. <Br /> <br /> And is not it so typical of low budget stories, do they have to create an imaginative country in southern Mexico? <br /> <br /> Well, well, I started it 2! Only for special effects, the rest is absolute garbage!
