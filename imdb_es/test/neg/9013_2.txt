For those viewers who thought the 1979 film "Alien" was the first to portray a male earthly being impregnated by an evil extraterrestrial, "The Night of the Blood Beast", made 21 years earlier, it may come as a surprise. In this movie, he is believed to be the first American man in the world of space accidents on Earth and, after the exam, he is dead. Later it reappears, with only a half dozen things of marine aliens growing in its abdomen. The mother (?) Alien also appears to terrorize the small band of scientists who are watching our gravid hero, and she (?) Seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rock creature of a "Star" of 1969 ". Trek "episode." Anyway, with its brief 62-minute run time, a small group of scientists and a cheap-looking monster, this movie suggests nothing less than a Z-grade warming for "The Outer Limits." would be released four years later), but without the written fine that is usually boasted that show.Despite the spooky title, this film is decidedly science fiction, not horror, and offers no alarm, no nonsense, little suspense and little food to think later, it seems as if it cost around $ 100 (but probably cost double), and his musical score often seems to be unrelated to events (I will not use the word "action") on the screen. movie, there are many questions: How was our hero to give birth to these creatures? Why does the foreigner need to behead people to learn our language? (To justify that title, no doubt!) Why? what extraterrestrials that travel in space can not land on our planet, instead of having to travel on our ships? How was our hero impregnated to begin with? These are all issues with which this cheap little one can not be bothered. It really is only for the science fiction finalists of the fifties.
