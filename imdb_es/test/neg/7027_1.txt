"Mame" is a shame for many things: for Lucille Ball, for a story that has been told many times better, and for the musical genre in general. Ms. Ball does not understand her character at all and seems to be very sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but it's not enough. The production is very poor quality and cheap looking, the songs are below average and almost all the jokes fail. In addition, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to be reduced to a funerary rhythm. Avoid it at all costs, but see the lovely "Aunt Mame".
