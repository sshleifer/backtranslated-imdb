It is not uncommon for a celebrity to face the proverbial "wake-up call". And, if you survive this event, you come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of your particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedians, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were before. Such is the case of Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities, since I have much better things to do with my life than to dedicate them to control others. Therefore, I was unaware of most of what Lawrence had gone through before this movie. It was interesting but, unfortunately, all very common. I was left with the broader impression that the act of standing of this guy simply was not very funny. Save the great messages of life for a book, just be fun on stage. If you want to see a funny Martin Lawrence, go and rent some of the old Def Jams he hosted. Do not rent Runteldat.
