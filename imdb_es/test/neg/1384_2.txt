Much has been done about the theft of material from other comics by Carlos Mencia (Mr. Holness, excuse me). Hell, even before Joe Rogan made an explosion with him on stage, he knew that Carlos Mensteala was stealing material from Cosby and Kinison and many others. <br /> <br /> To complicate the crime of his theft, he recounted these MALA comic genie Jokes. <br /> <br /> And that is a crime that he continues to perpetuate in this program. I am sure that the writers of the series have to share some of the blame: it has to be hard to write jokes day after day ... but that is the reason why people get paid so much that they have to do it! These writers of the series must return to their jobs of flipping burgers or whatever they were doing before deciding to embark on a career of intellectual theft. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that you steal all your material. You can tell when he invented a joke on his own when what you are seeing transcends the simply horrible and goes directly into the territory of the horribly bad. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h In his program, ten-year-olds call him a genius. They will grow one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, you will dry up and fly.
