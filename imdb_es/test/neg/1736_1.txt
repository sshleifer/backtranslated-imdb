The only people I would recommend this film are blind and deaf, although I'm sure a sadomasochist would go crazy. This movie had nothing; Do not act, terrible music, horrible script, just the power to absorb any happiness of your soul. Maybe he's wondering why or even how I managed to sit down for the entire hour and a half of pure inanity, and honestly it's a difficult concept even for me. First of all, I had to go up and down as the movie progressed, as it was extremely difficult for me to get comfortable. Secondly, I only managed to do it without gnawing at my own arm to have something to die with by beating myself, calling my friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the first thirty minutes, and it was a fatal mistake for me. Normally I like movies to leave you with something for the end, but all this was a shot ... For your mental health, do not watch this movie.
