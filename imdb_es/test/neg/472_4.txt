Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, rich industrialist, ends up with a part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian taxi driver Yegor. The two could not be more different, but they share one thing: both were murdered by the same woman. Returned to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely association to track down their common nemesis. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the horror film genre B that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time, the laughter is not revealed and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to fill the void in this film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and action figures, I expected another hit to add to my collection. Although, after watching this movie before the purchase, I'm glad I did not have the "pleasure" of adding it. <br /> <br /> The first movie goes wrong in the story, which at first glance, seems I like harmless fun but it turns out to be boring to dribble. Which is a sad thing to say, because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. Comedy never really hits, it just makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are fun and resulted in the public having seen what we have already seen ... fighting against himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, the brother of the director of Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. It brings freshness and an entertaining moment when the film really needs it. It helps if you're a fan and you've been following these Evil Dead puppets to Xena, so I felt compelled to like this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as a director, from the direction of TV episodes. The Hercules series is apparent. Campbell makes the movie work well enough, even with the low budget. In the end, there are not as many things for this as you might expect, but Campbell fans will be left behind no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I will not.
