The worst movie I've seen. I still do not understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had bills to pay ... The best part of the cult happens during a flashback that brings us during World War II when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. That's the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be aimed at the beginning of the 80s, but then a New Beattle appears ... Incredible! This film was directed in 2001 ... I'm sure it took less than two weeks to make that movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife filed for divorce after seeing that picture and that Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to being the man under the yellow baseball cap. Pathetic!
