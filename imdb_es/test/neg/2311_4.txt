The first comments of the users are very detailed for a very vague movie. I'm not saying I do not agree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To go straight to the point, this is very much like watching a really bad amateur porn movie. There are some funny points in the movie, but with the kind of things that happen in today's young people every day is pretty boring. The main actor in the movie is a pompous imbecile and both the boy and the girl in the movie are too modest to be in a movie like this. DO NOT WAKE YOUR MONEY IN THIS MOVIE. The only reason I gave him a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least one attractive girl in the movie and towards the end, you could see the girl's almost total frontal nudity, that is, that's the only thing. It's worth seeing for the end
