Well, then not all Australian films are so good. Yes, there may have been very few with much merit. Take Away, however, is an absolute bomb, classified as one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I wanted to like it. I figured I was going to give it a try. I've even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel like a traitor who is giving a bad review to this movie, but ... The plot is quite thin (I will not bother to tell ... read the synopsis), which I can forgive: there are many movies that can cover that with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away's jokes cover their plot like a $ 2 prostitute skirt. Probably the only laughs that came from the other 6 people at the movies were the bad performances and the dialogue. Take Away falls like a simulator of Dim for a week ... You might understand that joke if you see the movie, but the joke is not worth it.
