This was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Forget that it is clear that no investigation was conducted regarding Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha!). The writing was horrible, the premise completely implausible, and frankly, the characters were embarrassing. For my life, I can not understand why experienced actors would bow so low and participate in something as horrible as this god. Now, I have never seen the original and I do not know if this film pays homage to its original form. I understand that the original was not established in Detroit. Why would they deviate from that without investigating the details on the stage just tell me that it was more than the cast that sought to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this crap, unless you're from Detroit and want some comic relief.
