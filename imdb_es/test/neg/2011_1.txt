... and that's a damn shame! Make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the WORST vampire movie of the new millennium so far (I have not seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but there is nothing worse than this). Do not be fooled, be the brilliant cover of H.R. Gigeresque of the movie. This is so bad, almost funny. I can not describe all the emotions that this film evoked. I laughed, I screamed on the screen, I sat asleep, nodding in disbelief, ... This movie has 'cheap & cheese' written everywhere. The best thing about this film are the opening credits and the opening shots that present more or less CGI or two spaceships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice-over is activated, you start smelling something fishy. And, in fact, everything goes downhill quickly after that. <br /> <br /> The crew of a salvage spacecraft finds an abandoned ship, the Demeter, which appears to be heading for Earth. They enter it, sealing their destiny. This film is, above all things, a low budget brazen ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Until the twist of the plot, the character of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, reveals that she is a robot. Coolio goes bad over like the blood sucker, bloodsucker 187 (pffff, bell code like name?!?!). The captain of Casper Van Dien is called Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) And it looks like ... well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, former commander of Demeter, is only shown on a monitor screen and it really seems that he has trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Count Orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable of Dracula to (dis) adorn the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of a good-looking futuristic black suit or something like that, he wears a cheap old-school fringed Halloween costume. Did you think that Richard Roxburgh was not as convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> The scenario designers exceeded this. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between a tanker and an old steel factory, which they decorated with horrible lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns that resemble the .45 magnates of today and "Prof" uses a wheelchair that is not motorized and not floating. It must move around to be able to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from a dry corpse, some impalements and a dismemberment there is absolutely no gore. And vampire fangs and contact lenses look as fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt end of the story: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having a final (bloody) confrontation with Count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control room. Then, Aurora explains that before her program was updated and joined the narcotics, it used to be a "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure bot. So she says: "Well then, what are you waiting for?" Humvee responds: "I do not have to tell me twice, come on, girl", he picks her up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" The ship explodes and credits roll. No sex scene, no Erika flaunting her tits, no bloody climax, ... Just one more photo of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over. A must for all lovers of bad movies, but I must warn you that sometimes it becomes very painful. And all those who claim that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium is crazy, or just have not seen Dracula 3000 yet.
