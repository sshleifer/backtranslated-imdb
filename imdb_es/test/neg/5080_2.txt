When I saw the names of the main actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought that the film should at least be quite funny or interesting. Instead, all I got was not just 92 boring minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen, and listening to tons of bad words and bad "bad cop" phrases. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie does not have a good story to begin with. And when you have that, nobody can help you, neither Statham, nor Wesley Snipes ... nor John McClane could save this movie :-) It could be great for children, if they are not more than 12 years old, because they do not care much the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.
