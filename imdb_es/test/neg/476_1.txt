Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian I can not remember how many times I talk to Americans, much less that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There's a war there, right?" or "I never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have internet" Go to see "The man with the brain that screams" by Bruce Campbell. I was curious about this movie, because 1) I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell: trilogy of "Evil Dead" and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was shot entirely in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost impossible to see. 3) I enjoy good movies B <br /> <br /> Well ... The film presents our country as an endless gypsy town where they assault your car, wave illegal weapons and you can die at any time. And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offensive. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach are a great team, Bruce does his special: he hits himself and that's it. There is nothing more to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives this movie 10 just because of Bruce's cult status, but it does not deserve more than 3. Waste of the movie.
