Please, if you are thinking of renting this movie, do not do it. If you are thinking about watching a couple of downloaded clips, do not do it. If I got my way, nobody would have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> The performance, despite being one of the highlights of the film, was still pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. The ingenious liners were something you would expect from a room with highly paid 7-year-old antisocial children who eat splinters of paint for breakfast. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it tries to be. a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (not under any circumstances associate these 2 films) in which it is so bad that it is fun. But he also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, so that his sense of humor is too paralyzed to do anything other than unleash his gag reflex in an attempt to save himself. <br /> <Br /> I could continue for much more, detailing how horrible it really was, but I think it would take away the will to live alone to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I'll go to the boil to feel clean again ...
