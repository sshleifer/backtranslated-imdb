There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based films, but more than any other is the way in which filmmakers give themselves as a creative license about history. If you have so much imagination, why not use that talent to do something original? Otherwise stick to the facts. This could have been a good movie if only they had done that. Ed Gein was an incredibly terrifying human being. It has been said that if I took Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, wrap them in one person, Ed Gein would still be sicker / more scared. So, why can not someone make a movie about him that can convey this? When will you discover that reality is more frightening than fiction? <br /> <br /> I've read books and watched news programs about him and, now I'm not a scriptwriter or anything, but I think there's enough documentation in Gein that it should not take much to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without create murders that had never been documented. I am aware that he was only convicted of two murders, but with all the evidence found in his house and in his barn, there should be many other ways to put together this film instead of using the agent's relationship with his mother and his girlfriend as stuffing, and a lot of that. <br /> <br /> I guess what I'm asking is this ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than about Ed Gein? ? Why did we not get to know his mother, his father and his brother, and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath that was ... the abuse he endured as a child and that could have been contributed to the man he became? Instead, all we got from his childhood were the flashes of him when he was a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> In the end I give it 4/10 stars. That's 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although in my opinion it was a bad deal, considering that Gein was a small man, and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine. Maybe he was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
