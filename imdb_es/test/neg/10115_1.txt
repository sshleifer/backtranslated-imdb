At what point does a movie become so bad that it's good? Committed to his horror, Darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c ** p's cinematography and for that reason alone, probably deserves some kind of prize. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the ancient battle of Heaven and Hell. for the unclaimed souls of the recently deceased. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves in various ways like a pack of cats, a hooded figure of Grim Reaper with a face of flickering flames similar to an electric fire with coal effect, a Philip Marlowe-a- Like with a serious bad manicure and a psychologist who seems to be up to date with Kwik-Save. <br /> <br /> The protagonists compete for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film in a foggy field. and, strangely enough, a boarding school in an attempt to evade their persecutors. <br /> <br /> The plot extends more than a person's sandwich without character development or an attempt to create suspense. The performance is ridiculous, comparable to a school play, although that would be an insult to many educational establishments. And the dialogue .......... Oh, how my sides hurt! With the unclaimed souls of the dead described as "unwanted gherkins of life" by the demon of the burning flames, you wonder if hell is really a McDonalds. <br /> <br /> But it's strangely convincing, you're just watching To see how bad it can be, in just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent on involuntary giggles.
