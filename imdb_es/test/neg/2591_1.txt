In general, I am quite tolerant of movies and am very easily entertained, however, this movie was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after seeing on the cover that William Zabka was in it (Karate Kid bad boy) and during this movie I could see that this would be the only reason. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tremendous loss of talent from the actors. The music and the sound are terribly sticky. I could not believe it in a movie made in the 90s! <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie unless you are interested in one of the actors.
