I like black humor and things that are not for PC, but not if it is without a purpose to elevate me. Destroying a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap. <br /> <br /> There are people who could make the jokes of the concentration camps fun, but whoever made this movie unfortunately failed even in the task VERY easy to make fun of. about the Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if you are the equivalent in Germany of a southern farmer (= southern southerner of a town where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you will certainly fail in this and also in life. I've heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this piece of shit mentioned here is an insult to the next worst movie) stinks like the calf that the creators of this movie met a few years ago.
