What we are given in this fashion movie is a "frat-pack" of friends from the university, which is now approaching 30 years (what we all know, of course, his generation considers as the "new 20") . With four men and one girl, we have been given the following types: apparently "unemployed" and frequent drug users, along with a person who is successful at work and another who is trying to be. All are, in their own way, adrift while trying to find a future and emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, these are people that this reviewer would definitely never mind modeling afterwards. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all of their lives. Except in the case of an individual (who appears on the path to finding him), none appears to be aimed at emotional satisfaction in his life. And so, the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock on the door causes the person who answers it to answer unexpectedly and sincerely "I love you". <br /> <br /> With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are those who deserve or deserve several hundred thousand dollars that are thrown away when presenting their stories. <br /> <br /> PS - The writer / director, Johnson, definitely seems to have a problem with showing gay sex scenes - --- Without such problems in presenting longer and more revealing heterosexuals. Why could that be? <br /> <br /> ****
