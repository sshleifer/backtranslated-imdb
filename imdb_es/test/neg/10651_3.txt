It does not matter the serious logical gaps, it does not matter the representations of characters so cliché, it does not matter the random writing, and this movie you may like. It was assumed that the main character of Alyssa was endearing, the heroine you aspired to be saved (or, in this case, save herself). But instead, she just laughs and does a marvel: are all professional dancers really that stupid? His busy mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that the ballet companies are evil monsters, ready to snatch their poor innocent child, with an artistic director / villain always present and scathing. And the cliché! Not only does she become anorexic, bulomedic, an addict without a prescription and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. It is as if the writer read all the horror stories he could unearth about the ballet and decided to see how much he could get in two hours (with commercials). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. . This "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia that is occurring does not exist in all dance schools that I have attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared that they even suggest that a girl might have a better chance of losing a little more weight, most of the dancers in my classes would actually be considered overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never happen, but not to the extent that it was described in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem that this film had was the writing style of the media to reach the end. Her new boyfriend probably had half an hour total screen, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were simply accessories, decorations to promote the story. Given the correct dialogue, this would have been a very complex mental study of a psychological problem. As it is, it becomes a one-woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does not have the gall to do it. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this film would be a supposed "vision" of what really goes behind closed doors in a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very insulting film, which portrays dancers as stupid and parents as aggressive and ill-informed. Those adjectives describe more correctly the people who received this on the air in the first place. 3/10
