Although I tried to avoid German films recently, positive reviews attracted me to rent this one. There I am again deceived by the German media that have been promoting the domestic movies again and again. For me it is not surprising that nobody abroad wants to see this shit. The idea of ​​making this movie is not an idea (I guess a fool read an article in a women's magazine about quick dating). In short: the characters (which are none), the dialogue and the content are incredibly trivial, trite and cliché, I kept observing them because I could hardly believe what I saw. By the way, to call the flat theses delivered mechanically by the dialogue of the figures (certainly of the mentioned magazines), it would be simply incorrect. Acting is so exaggerated that I can not remember anything worse than that on the screen in a long time. You have to guess that the director had no idea at all. Surprisingly, distributors and producers across the country are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) do not generate interest worldwide. Why? Because it is a waste of time and money.
