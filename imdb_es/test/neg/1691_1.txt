The classic author C.S. Lewis once wrote an essay stating that it is not worth reading a child's story, seeing it, et cetera, if only children can enjoy it. I would say that this movie is easy to defend as a defense of your argument. <br /> <br /> Around the age of five or six, I loved it, I tracked it down only three or four years later and found it wet, poorly animated, written confusingly and confusingly, and with horribly repetitive songs and horrible (I'm watching you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production that points to cheerful nonsense and whims, but that result in an ugly twee, frustrating mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, show this to your baby, but I strongly recommend that you do not buy a copy or try to watch the video. If you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit, go for 'Oliver Twist' or the brilliant adaptation of 'The Box of Delights' by the BBC.
