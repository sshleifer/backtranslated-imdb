This film is based on a novel by Stephen King in which the mysterious merchant Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers each citizen of Castle Rock the item he wants most, but there is a very high price to pay for these transactions. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) will soon be forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King's cinema: I can see why some people would think it was boring. Go ahead without offering genuine fears and forcing the viewer to spend time (once again) with a group of repulsive losers whose hatred between them is creepy. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the novel and I do not believe. That this mediocre movie does it justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from one book to another. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt too charming. We're supposed to be scared of Gaunt at the right time, it's not fun. I also hate that the sheriff's chief aide (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as an annoying Barney Fife type imbecile. Star Ed Harris seems as if his agent had forced him to take this picture, but as a professional he is, he really sinks his teeth in his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (like Polly, Pangborn's love interest) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard roles of mental imbalance) are the closest to creating personable characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is also disgusting and mean. <br /> <br /> Although I'll be damned if I did not feel a little cathartic seeing a lot of nasty movie characters torn apart. The climax has some good explosions. <br /> <br /> I often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case I think I should be honest and just say: 3/10.
