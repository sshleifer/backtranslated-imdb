This hybrid Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu extremely basement was released in my country by a questionable DVD label that, in general, only deals with the transfer of pure trash to the disc, so it was not exactly a favorable herald. Several other titles were released in the same series, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and, judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews, none of these belongs to the elite of the 70's. , none. "TNT Jackson" is a very bad movie, completely lacking in a significant plot but that presents too many laughable fight scenes and a horrible performance to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman ?? Never too embarrassed to earn some easy money? He assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of oriental Kung-Fu movies and modern Blaxploitation films. The result of Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller was "TNT Jackson"; the tale of a black baby girl who travels to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. She quickly discovers that he was killed by a criminal network of drug traffickers and swears to avenge him. Ms. Jackson gently infiltrates the subsoil and encounters sexist pimps, useful undercover agents, lots of vicious Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; Everyone wants a piece of dazzling body of TNT in one way or another. I sincerely doubt that movie concepts are more elementary than this, but ?? unfortunately - all the other aspects stink too. The battle scenes are too long and they are pathetically organized. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers try hard to look menacingly and take a difficult position, but in the end all they do is kick in the air and jump stupidly through the rooms. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack is enormously disappointing (what happened to soul music?), The few dialogues are poorly written and the performances are inferior. Speaking of which, Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but she still can not hold a candle for Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only one really good and memorable scene in "TNT Jackson," namely, the famous hotel room battle where Bell, completely naked, except for the panties, repeatedly turns the light on and off while kicking some thugs to hell. Fun scene ... I just have not realized if it's thanks to the ingenuity of the light switch or Bell's perfectly shaped breasts.
