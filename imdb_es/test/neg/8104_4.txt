This movie is really a regrettable excuse for making movies. The pace is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low and the performance is a cutoff rate (ie, except Bela Lugosi). The audio at this time is also terrible, with so much additional noise in the background that it sounded to me like a plane took off for the whole movie. If these things bother you at all, do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is very good. The Japanese hired a German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) to operate several Japanese agents and turn them into the image of prominent American businessmen whom the Japanese have kidnapped and murdered. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and imprisoned. He later escapes and travels to the United States to avenge his patients through a series of highly publicized murders. <br /> <br /> It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only decent actress in the movie and, to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and heavy. The main actress ended up being quite boring and stereotyped, while the police officer assigned to her case was the common dominant male, chauvinist and always correct that is found in many films of this period. <br /> <br /> I also discovered that the work of the camera was not inspired, I often took the same exact angles of the same rooms over and over again. After a while, this tends to drag the film down, setting a very slow pace for the "action", which is more or less nonexistent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is fascinating. , and with a better writer, director, script, team and actors, could become an excellent movie. Unfortunately, these disadvantages hold the film for now, and I can not recommend it to anyone other than those who love the most open films.
