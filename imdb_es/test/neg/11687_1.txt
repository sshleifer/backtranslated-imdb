I have rented the film because I am very fond of war movies and in the photo on the cover I read "better than saving Ryan privately" ... mmmmm ... I thought it was great! Guys ... it's just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun Nothing to do with a good war movie. I want my money back! Why the f ... k people lie ??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light ... but they did not make it. Sorry about this ... but the movie is horrible. It shows the Italians as "Mafia and mandolino" <br /> <br /> The American as a stupid farmer The Germans as an even stupider farmer. <br /> <br /> The actor is ridiculous and unprofessional. <br /> <br /> Please ... please ...
