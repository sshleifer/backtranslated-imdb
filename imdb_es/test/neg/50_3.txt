My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a kid. We loved seeing them, even when they were bad, they made some fun. This was one of those films, something difficult to review, since I've only seen it once as a child, but it's not something I want to trace again to be able to do a deeper revision. The story has an old legend of the terror actor dying. I seem to remember that he acted a bit like an exaggerated Vincent Price, without being nice and classy. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? The movie is over? No, as some children for some reason grab the body and are prepared for a fun night of being slaughtered by the ham from beyond the grave. I remember that the murders were nothing so special after the first couple and I remember that this movie was quite disappointing. It seemed to have a good premise, but it simply could not deliver the products since they needed more great deaths and that super actor of terror needed to add a bit to his repertoire.
