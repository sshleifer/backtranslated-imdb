Unlike some of the reviews written here, I did not hate this movie. It's a movie that COULD have been much better than it was. It's not Oscar material, it's true, but it's much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and a line. Of course, this movie was badly written. AND TERRIBLY directed and produced. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems that the producer (s) saw American Beauty many times and thought "I'll use it in an action movie!" I thought the movie was not so badly performed. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, he just ran into a bad address. And once this movie arrived in the production room, things got worse. The main actress, I think, had the same problems. Some of the other performances were suspicious, yes, but it was a low budget movie. Once again, I would say that it is the director's job to pick it up and correct it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I agree with the first review I read that this movie is not worth seeing. Or maybe it's worth seeing, if you're a film student and you want to see what you should NOT do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and that's a compliment.
