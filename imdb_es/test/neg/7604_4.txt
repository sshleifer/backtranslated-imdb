This was a real disappointment to me. The original bride with white hair is a great fantasy film of kung fu, but this was quite weak. I did not care at all about the new characters that unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story was not well developed. Although the first film was tragic, the participation of this one was tedious (since I simply counted the time until the end in which the unfortunate lovers would meet). The action was poor in this too. The fights were not very well choreographed and there really was not much kung fu. Just a few weak sword fights between the highly unpleasant Lui and one of Lin's henchmen. Lin herself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people to the walls and sometimes to her hair, far from the impressive presentation with the whip and kung fu she showed in the previous movie. I still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was a fast pace and I wanted to see what would happen at the end, although I (like most of those who saw the first one) predicted that it would be like it did. and after seeing it, I found it anti-climatic and wished that they had made an adequate sequel or simply left the story in peace. I really recommend the first, but as for the sequel, only the fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride once again need to apply.
