Four young girls from elementary school witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game. The murderer is a strange young man named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event rejoin in happier circumstances in the same town where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but they soon learn that the demonic murderer Milo has also returned, still a child, unchanged, even after nearly two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie. It makes it look really cool (although I still expected a bad movie to come out). When I put the DVD in my player, the menu appears and makes the movie look good. Unfortunately, this movie is not everything that excited me. The movie is your average attempt at a slasher movie and when I say average, I mean all those other low budget slasher movies that have never been well received by most members of the horror community (I'm talking about you , the horror fanatic). In other words, you could approach any fan of horror and most of the answers would be "this sucks." <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? First of all, the art of the DVD cover makes Milo look really dark, but it ruins everything by showing his face in the film in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very strange character. Second, the back of the cover tells Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. Let them pack and leave because Milo is so much better ... why the hell would he want to say something like that when it's a no? -Name, low-budget Slasher movie that has obviously failed? I mean, it just raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder to impress yourself. In a last effort to attract attention, he says (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda". It only shows you how low you are going to get the most attention possible for the movie. <br /> <br /> The blood in the movie sucks, the director gives you some horrible angles when Milo attacks someone. The music is not that bad and I never fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to find out what Milo really is. My best bet would be that he is a zombie, if someone else knows, tell me. Rest assured that I will not lose sleep by thinking about it.
