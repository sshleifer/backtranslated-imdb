This film offended me so much that I had to write SOMETHING about it, so, please, buy me. <br /> <br /> His only redeeming virtue, apart from a good performance, is that it does not exceed 107 minutes. Even that duration is about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Comparisons have been made here with the bright dark "The Grifters", but I can not see it. They are two different movies in total. The 'Swindled' closest to an existing movie is 'The Sting', made in 1973. It borrows (sorry, STEALS) from this splendid 'entertainment' of George Roy Hill, which is exactly what it was. I enjoyed it because I did not pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many false clues in 'Scam' that I thought I was in a fish tank. It's very confusing, but that's just one of his many problems. The main one is this: if you make a film where everyone lies to others, where everyone is cheating, we do not have an "anchor" to build on. The inevitable result is a mix of very careless seconds from other caper movies. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this film is complicit and objectionable. Surely a basic class of Cinema 101 will tell us that the audience has to "worry" about someone. We can not "worry" about anyone here: they are ALL pigs. It could have worked like an unbridled comedy, but it reproduces it directly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ MORE. GREAT 'SPOILER' COMING. WE ARE SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much false blood and so many false murders that it does not exacerbate the credulity, that destroys it. The ending is absolutely ridiculous: a 'murder' in an airport full of people that is not really a 'murder'? And the 'murdered' man, soaked with blood, simply stands up, brushes himself away, with fake blood, with the booty? While the police and the hordes of people watch, and nobody intercedes? The director must have a lot of balls if he thinks we should buy this. Noirish B-movies of the 1940s did better. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European films, but this confirms that Schlock does not always come from Hollywood. In regards to 'Swindled', my judgment is based on a famous phrase from the producer, often badly spoken, Samuel Goldwyn, who knew all about schlock: 'Incl√∫yeme fuera'.
