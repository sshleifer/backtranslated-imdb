Yes, it was a horrible movie, but I think there was a song near the beginning of the movie, called "I have a Woody" or something similar. I would love to find a soundtrack for that if one is available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and as horrible as it was, it had its moments, and that song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like girls in bikini, this is the movie for you. But if you do not, then do not bother. It was a great material for MST 3K, I have to admit it. However, I would love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not only that song, but a couple more were very funny, and they are classics as far as I'm concerned.
