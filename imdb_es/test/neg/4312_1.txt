This is one of the worst movies I've seen and, certainly, the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor has ever made. I can not believe that a person who has created a movie like Teen Deewarein can create shit like this. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is really flawed, as Zeenat has to find Meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. Common logic says that if Zeenat can not search for Meera easily, the Soudi government will not, so Zeenat can securely falsify Meera's signature or fingerprint and produce it to the Soudis. Another silly thing is that Shankar has given an incorrect address in his passport, so Indian government officials can not get to the address, but after some time Meera gets Shankar's suitcase through the Soudi government . Woohoo! Does not it make Soudis well connected in the network more than the Indians? <br /> <br /> Nagya does a little more than a cameo in the movie with the role of Chopra, who is looking at Meera and looking for Meera's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad's help (this guy just wasted) May she keep it. <br /> <br /> Nagya can not speak Hindi and other types have helped him translate the dialogues in English he writes, in Hindi. This time, it seems that his assistant was in serious poisoning, writing dialogues such as "Imaan ki Chalaang" (leap of honesty). In a matter of minutes, for our worst nightmares, Meera not only gives this honest jump, but takes advantage of her feet to do "Imaan ka Naach" (dance of honesty). <br /> <br /> One of the only bright spots that the film has is its cinematography and its really beautiful nuances. But since Bollywood learned what is called post-production, almost all movies have vibrant colors and well-combined backgrounds, so it's no big deal. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everyone is ready to be affected.
