Normally, I would say that I loved this movie. Not because of the performance, although that was good. Not because of the script, which was regular. The reason I would normally have loved this movie is because of the intense action that starts from the beginning and does not end until the end credits end. But, the problem with this movie, and I felt it was a big problem, was the horrible CGI. It seems that they ran out of money and could not complete the effects. Many shots of the effects appear to be lime in its roughest form. Since it is obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they should not have released it. Actually, the effects are insulting. It seems obvious that I do not care about making a decent final product for the consumer. If it were not for that, I would give this movie a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
