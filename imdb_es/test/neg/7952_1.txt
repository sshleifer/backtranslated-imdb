... Or is this another way below the masterpiece from the bottom of the barrel? Preferably both! Between 1969 and 1972, somewhere, there were several horrible horror movies that have been lost again. Nothing else needs to be explained, requested or shouted out loud. If you followed closely my writings on CARNIVAL OF BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MONK, then you will know what awaits you with SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The title sounds great; It's just the weak script that should have gone the other way! Even so, this is unquestionably, the most terribly written piece of film mastery ever worked on in the film! <br /> <br /> If you thought I was an early killer (which benefits the average IMDb user to write another comment), better luck next time! The real truth behind the script has NOTHING to do with the movie, which purportedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath to "kill" and do some ugly facial sculptures on his victims. It feels like you're watching another early episode of "SCOOBY-DOO". My favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippies play. And hurray for an actress by the name of "Eugenie Wingate" for giving us the worst facial change, ever! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this rarity of 30 years in a basement for five dollars; It's the perfect novelty item to go back to those psychedelic days of floral power, bad fashions and trashy music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM also appears in the Troma movie archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when it reaches the top of the list of the lowest 100, along with some cheaper ones from the early 70's; God knows they NEED !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
