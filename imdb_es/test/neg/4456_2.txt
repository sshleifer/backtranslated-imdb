Of all the adaptations of Alistair MacLean's books, I feel that this qualifies as the worst, but do not blame MacLean! It would seem that everything that this film shares with the novel is the same title. We have no suspense, no sense of a harbinger of mystery, no possibility of empathizing with the main characters. We spent the whole duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to take off her clothes (for Charlotte, it seems that this takes a very long time!). However, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling's tits can not really save this disastrous movie. MacLean has been kicked once again in the gutter to withstand the attack of those bitter hacks and nit pickers who apparently would blame him for all the evils that occurred while trying to film his books. Poor Alistair must have crawled into a corner and moaned when he came out. At least "Bear Island," which also uses Maclean's name but apparently is not from his novel, was a bit exciting. The excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.
