This movie was useless. I can not even call it science fiction, since that requires more than one movie to simply take place in space. "Max Q" is not even set in space for the entire movie. The story / plot is not original, the cast is nothing special, although it would be strange with a cast in a mediocre movie ... Also, it is not particularly exciting or well said. At least, it is balanced fairly, so that nothing and no one stands out. Everything is equally insipid. Usually, I find something of quality in the "space movies", even if it's only 90 minutes of semi-lame entertainment that borders on the low budget pathetic, but "Max Q" did not even give me that satisfaction. In short, a complete waste of time.
