What a sucky movie. This is definitely a low class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers assaults Russian bunkers en masse as an old battle of the First World War. The acting is mediocre, the plot thin and similar to a thread. Sometimes it is difficult to follow where you are going. The action sequences are quite useless (when it shows any), except for the fact that they use authentic equipment / vehicles from WW2. This is by no means on the same level as "Saving Private Ryan" or "Platoon". Many attempts without value in the development of the character, which lead nowhere. Old good officer / bad officer theme that is highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12-year-old boy. I could have managed better. Pity that this is the same guy who did "Das Boot (The Boat)", because it was a good movie. He must have left too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this movie. I bought it on DVD, better rent it instead.
