First: the recent campaign of this film is a great deception. Judging by the cover, one would think that it is a kind of scandal in which Kylie plays a character who has sex, takes drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market scheme. She is just in that and does not do any of the things. The marketing here is amazing, and I'm surprised the filmmakers have not opposed it. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was a big disappointment to me. It looked like an episode of Sunset Beach run carelessly by a teenager Quentin Tarantino. And that's not a compliment, of course. <br /> <br /> I think the weakness of the film in the first place is the story. It seems that it is nothing. These are great teenagers who have fun living 'to the limit'. However, the characters do have a certain personality, but the film does not take advantage of its potential. As said, there is no history of any substance here. It seems to elaborate too much in a great dialogue and ends up looking like a colorful MTV ad. It definitely has that feeling. <br /> <br /> Even so, I think some people might enjoy it, but I would say there are much better movies like this one.
