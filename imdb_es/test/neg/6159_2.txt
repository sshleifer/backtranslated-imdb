This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seems to have nothing to do with what was happening. The movie seems to be an extremely poor scam of Bladerunner, that is, rogue android being chased by a bounty hunter (or a ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker has a surprisingly good performance as the rogue cop mentioned above. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never discover anything of any substance about the android or what their intentions are. There is a disconcerting scene where Bill Paxton (who has hijacked the android) plays a particular song on his cardboard plane for no particular reason (the song is called "Shape of things" by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene in which the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Do not think it
