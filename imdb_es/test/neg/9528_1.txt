Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a very bold and daring movie. I enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and the story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are horrified when he reveals the naked statue that portrays the truth, after not having taken it to her and the few who did, helped along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them putting things before God, going to parties on the beach acting inappropriately, their materialistic ways and other things in which the people of our world do things that tend to not be morally correct. In the end, by not getting followers, you must enter only at the gates of heaven. This film seems very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown along it, especially considering the period of time in which this movie was made. The images and the symbolism portrayed in this film seemed incredible to me. The way they made the translucent naked woman and use a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing the different sins of people as they walked along the road and refused to follow the path, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was an excellent way to represent the people of today. This movie does a very good job of conveying the moral message to its audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous way of capturing the attention of his viewers with his creativity, symbolism, images and audition. Even the piano music throughout this movie is very beautiful and fits the whole theme.
