"Go Fish" obtained with a lot of promise the reputation of a filmmaker of Rose Troche. <br /> <br /> It is then difficult to understand how I could produce a film composed of stereotypes that one associates with inferior comedies. . The whole movie sounds hollow. I cringed all the way. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be a look at human sexuality in the nineties. Well, there's not much more to learn here than "In and Out". At this time, most of us really know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and men who feel sexually attracted to men, and there are even men who are sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely has this revelation been depicted on the screen with so little ingenuity and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
