I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are crazy in India, especially among the commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor? That was a great joke! What guts he has to harvest everything he can at his best. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie is becoming a super-duper success! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has collected a box office collection of 14 million rupees. Compared to Apne, which has accumulated 7 million rupees in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit through the absurd Sivaji of Apne and Rajnikant? Should I try this movie too to understand what things this film has that made it a great success? The story is about the real-life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who has gone to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for a murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after he escapes from prison is to prove his innocence and find the real murderer. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tries hard but fails miserably. He is pathetic. I was thinking, what could have caused the movie to click so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the salvation of the film is the script to the point where Himesh escapes from prison. (But after that, the nose of the film dives into unbearable stupid limits) Second, the songs in the movie are good, catchy, numbers that attract the crowd. Third, Mallika Sherawat? She looks beautiful and also acts well, like the second lady. I can imagine the Mallika fans coming to see the movie just for her. Fourth, is the cinematography of the film nice? Especially the German locals are a delight to watch. Fifth, most of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya. With clich√©d dialogues that would probably connect to the young crowd. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job of covering Himesh's pathetic acting skills as much as possible with shots that do not need Himesh to act a lot. <br /> <br /> The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a small budget cinema heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. In general, the movie is below average. <br /> <br /> Was I thinking about the whole movie? What would happen if the same script of the film was made with Salmaan as the main character? I think it would have been a much better affair. It may be then that I would have given the movie 6 out of 10. But now? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
