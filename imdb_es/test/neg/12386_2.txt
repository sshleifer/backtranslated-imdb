OK, this 'horror' movie was meant to be a joke, right? Please tell me what was supposed to be a joke, then I'll understand. <br /> <br /> A large croaking bird with giant claws, or a claw, anyway, pounces on innocent people on the ground and engulfs them. above. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow exaggerate enough to keep things interesting, but at least enjoy a giggle when you see the "monster." It looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Or the director Fred Sears just made this photo in a hurry and knew that the bird seemed completely ridiculous, or really thought that his film and his creature were genuinely terrifying. I prefer to think, and hope, to come first. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
