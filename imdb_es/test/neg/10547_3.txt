This is the worst in the toxie series at the moment. The performance in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The main problem with this movie is all the sudden changes of the original. As if there was a different toxie friend in this one, or it could be the same character with a different name and played by a different girl. Why is this movie made like a Disney movie? After about fifteen minutes, it starts to be good with the gore and everything. There are 2 incredible murders, then the movie goes straight to the poop. After the 20 minutes movies are up the movie is very entertaining. H * LL IS GUARDABLE. Well, unless you're drunk, then do not watch this movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
