I do not know who financed it, or why, but this "desire to be", the vampire movie is really horrible. It tries to be modern and attracts the young audience of the MTV generation, but it's just ridiculous. The acting is horrible, and the direction is horrendous. I heard that the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money went?
