The television award shows that half of the time he is nominated to participate in comic programs, chat programs, question and answer programs, game shows, charity programs, Brighton. Just when you're at your starting point, and you think you can find salvation on the radio, the sound of good old JR hits you like a freight train that goes from Texas to downtown New York. He has lost an hour and is trying to make up for it. <br /> <br /> About this program (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> It's a normal chat program format with JR As host and a house band that consists of four gay men (ha ha ha, ow my sore sides.) and the first season had Andy Davis, but he left or was fired to make way for the Ego de Ross. <br /> <br /> Ross will use his guests less as props and will not really hear them talking. Due to his "It's my ball and I'll take it home" attitude, you'll also see that the bigger the guest is, the more willing he is to lie and suck him, to go in with the big boys (like the weak kid at school who walks with the stalker). <br /> <br /> However, when a small TV reality show appears, Star Star will humiliate them joyfully, ask them personal questions about the past and tell them about their lack of history. nt to get the laughs. Sometimes it underestimates the popularity of a guest, says something to disparage him, and then, when the audience acts surprised, he will quickly become the man of the fall, the best example of this was when the star of "Life On Mars", John Simm He approached and said: how does someone like you get a job, do you think it's good, but not Hollywood? (Considering that Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were in the green room, I was really just trying to suck them). They were even on the couch). When the audience acted in shock, Ross said quickly, "What, I'm a little dizzy from wearing that corset, I do not know what I'm saying." If he does not have any low television lifestyle, he will only dedicate himself to the four gay men at the piano with pranks more outdated than his fashion. <br /> <br /> It's a very different story when a Hollywood A-lister or a great TV star appears on the show, he tells them stories to entertain them. When some actor explains that he was in a support band, Jonathon Ross will say something like "Wow, well, whenever I'm going to see a band that tried to seem interested in the support band, to make them feel like they were wanted." underline message being "please, like me, I was probably one of the people who encouraged you when you were in your band". To top it off, there is an audience of Ross fans so hooked on every old joke and bulling, which really makes it a bad show. <br /> <br /> It is better to see the US chat programs. UU In any place so hard to see.
