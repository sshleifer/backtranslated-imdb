... when it is doubled in another language. Let's face it: neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And given the pitched lines that are supposed to be pronounced, this is a situation that is lost. Any kind of voiceover will be an improvement (and actually it is, at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But that is only a secondary point. The acting is bad. The accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen could not use his sword to get out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of movement exhibited by the child (who has undoubtedly had some training in martial arts) and with the athleticism shown by Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his thing. - There's nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some of the images are nice, I'll have to grant it to you. The skeleton bridge of the dragon looks great. But most of the time, the plaster is too obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not worth watching the movie. Even 'Conan the Destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). I would have preferred to see Bergman as Red Sonja as he was supposed to be, but I doubt he could have saved this movie, well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
