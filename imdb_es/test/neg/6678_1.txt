Usually, I would not waste time reviewing a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the previous movie of the same title, which is probably best known in the West as "The Untold Story") , but since the reviews are already quite vague as to what it really consists of, I thought it would be better to publish something more detailed, so that nobody feels tempted (like me) to buy it because of the movie. mystery. Honestly, I'd just say STAND UP. <br /> <br /> **** MAIN SPOILERS are contained below **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop", I expected to be like a Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese films "Guinea Pig. " Anyone who has seen enough of that series can see where their creators come from. There is a strong sense of humor in the whole world: you can not see the ridiculous "He Never Dies" without laughing and "The Making of Guinea Pig" is a fabulous turn of the whole thing, showing that it has just been done, with something of joy, by pretty affable gorehounds. All GP movies have punk rock, DIY, aesthetics shot on video, occasional flashes of genuine art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), an angry political agenda and distorted and distorted zeal that puts them in a league of their own. <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" does not have any of the above. <br /> <br /> It was filmed in a 35 mm film (with disastrously good production values), it lasts 90 exhausting minutes and is completely devoid of anything that redeems. The plot tells, in a flashback in an interview with the police of the suspects, about the systematic torture, death and eventual dismemberment of Grace, a prostitute addicted to heroin who is kidnapped and brutalized by her pimp and his henchmen when steal money br /> <br /> Despite his fleeting attempts to be a work of morality, the film has a distant and inhuman feeling and you can not stop thinking about the mentality of those behind it. Although she paints Grace half-heartedly as an innocent victim, the petty nature of her script and the protagonist's vicious and constant dialogue deviate into a shocking and totally unpleasant "he deserves it!" Point of view that makes everything almost impossible to see. Much more time is dedicated to detailing Grace's degradation and when her captors are finally found guilty and imprisoned, it seems a belated idea on behalf of writers who have long stopped worrying less. <br /> <br /> What it Does Find out why anyone would want to see a movie of this type is that even the kind of people who REALLY get rid of senseless sex and violence in movies would be missing out. Torture is just a continuous flow of kicks, slaps, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and, then, more and more extravagant demonstrations of power on behalf of the captors who use Grace's heroin addiction to make her carry out her orders. And when I say that, do not get me wrong, by the way. Unlike "Guinea Pig," with its frequent barrage of nudes that gives an almost adolescent sensation of mock procedures despite ultraviolence, "Human Pork Chop" has no such sexual connotations. There is no real nudity in the film and the violence is interpreted purely out of spite by the odious protagonists (who at the beginning of the film are seen putting a dog in a bag and hitting it against a brick wall, do not worry, it's not real, it's just a cheap special effect!). <br /> <br /> The only shedding of real blood in the film is towards the end when Grace's body is dismembered and bones boil, all very poor special effects (nowhere near "Guinea Pig" level) and , at that stage, you will probably already feel too miserable and sick to worry about what is happening. <br /> <br /> The film is depressingly grim and intransigent along a line similar to that of Buddy Giovinazzo's "Combat Shock" and I suppose it could even be compared, in one push. Both films deal with the gradual physical deterioration of an individual that exists in a nightmare environment without social or morally redeemable characters, and both films "climax" in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable and inescapable condemnation of the individual. <br /> <br /> To be fair, none of the 'glamorous' is violence (while "Guinea Pig" could easily be accused of this) but one can not help but wonder where the place is for a movie like this . Fail to many real points in his frank presentation of such brutality and with a lead rhythm, a virtually non-existent plot and the aforementioned lack of entertainment value, I just can not understand what would encourage anyone to see something. I like this. I only reached the end, with the sole purpose of being able to review it fairly ... and I hope that I did. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 0 out of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the canyon.
