Hears! The scream 2! What the fuck, wey? I have a friend that I would like you to meet. The Grudge 2 know the list of the worst of 2006 of Johnny The list of Johnny's Worst of 2006 complies with The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What is happening here? He had the impression that it was supposed to be a sequel to The Grudge instead of a remake. If that is the case, why does not he do nothing but redo the original? This float does not even feel like a movie. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the strange contortionist girl who makes that annoying croaking sound. <br /> <br /> A sound in which I recommend you not help me start. It was a bit creepy the first time I heard it, but I've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it has practically run its course. And it's even more annoying for the 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to imitate the sound when there was a quiet place in the movie. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Friends, YOU ARE NOT FUNNY, SO GO OFF! I promise, EACH TIME ONLY that a character walked slowly through an empty room (which is approximately 97% of the movie), someone from the audience would initiate it, "Uhhhhkkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkkkk". Yes, I know it's a horrible way to reproduce the sound with lyrics, but you understand the essentials. Then, some guy in the audience would laugh, and not to be left behind, he would give his own interpretation. I was very close to simply walking through the audience and hitting random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to make me start. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There is not a single scare or original idea in the whole movie. There is not a memorable performance. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar? Well, enjoy your two minutes of screen and a line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can deal with the fact that he has nothing more to do than walk around with the appearance that he is suffering from a pinched nerve. Can you believe that the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than The Grudge's? <br /> <br /> At least the original was quite spooky and had some effective jumping scenes. I did not jump once during this lameness (yes, I invented the word, deal with that). It's okay. Not once. The "fears" are manufactured and telegraphed so blatantly that there is absolutely no shock value once the "gotcha" moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good chess game: you always have four or five scenes ahead. <br /> <br /> There are also some strange scenes that do not make any sense. One that comes to mind immediately is a scene in which a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jar. Hey, I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of that during the movie. Laughing Sighing shaking his head. Fall asleep (I did it twice). <br /> <br /> The movie even makes an attempt of 1/5 of a heart in a "twist" of the plot. Wow. It's so bad that I do not think we should even dignify it by labeling it as a turn. Did they really believe that someone would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the ending is all the non-closing "look, we could have another sequel" route. As soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. Exactly my feelings. If the audience had paid money for this hamburger, then things would probably have turned violent, and I would have gladly led the charge. <br /> <br /> We have learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful fit of rage, then there is a curse behind. Like a Ben Affleck movie, it is a "stain" that always becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in The Grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers your budget during your first weekend, your sequel will be rushed, and most of the time it will be as bad as this and leave a stain in any theater where the shows films. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> If you're a total puny and you never saw The Grudge, then this could give you a couple of things. But I recommend that you save your money, otherwise, it is very likely that you are the one who leaves the theater with rancor.
