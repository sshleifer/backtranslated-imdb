I bought "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a two pack with "Destination Moon". Now I see why the distributors did that: nobody who has seen this movie would buy it alone. <br /> <br /> I can not understand what school system turned out to be the critic who claimed that RXM is "excellent". his predictions of how space travel would take place ... "Jump up and then turn 90 degrees to the right and drive faster and faster until you reach the escape speed ... I do not think you remember that from the Apollo program It does not matter that astronauts do not have weight once they turn off the engines, gravity changes direction every time they pass through the hatch to the engine room, go to the moon, but "I lost it"? No problem, it's just a jump-jump-and-a-jump (with a hand of divine providence) and you'll be on Mars! Well, if you want to put life on Mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgivable convention For the sake of the narrative, but can you make them look at least a little extraterrestrial? These Martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 BC." I can accept some scientific mistakes, but this would not happen with a second-grader over of the average. <br /> <br /> And that's apa rte of the holes of the plot that scream: 12 minutes before the launch (as we constantly remember by the annoying voice of the AP saying "X minus so many minutes") the astronauts are giving a press conference! I guess the decisive moment is why Dr. Eckstrom did not take off his coat and tie before launching into space. And how useful, though they planned to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that, they brought hiking equipment (and rifles!) In case they ended up on Mars. They are lucky to land anywhere, since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have Dr. E look out the window and tell the "pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) to modify the accelerators from time to time. Note to the designers of the XM-2: what about giving the pilot a window seat? <br /> <br /> I tell the previous comments about casual sexism that Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) had to perfection condemned them all by repeatedly ruining their fuel calculations, but well, that was at the beginning of fifties. She was there to fill her sweater, not a useful function. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is notable for being one of the first films to say "Ohmigod, we're all going to fly" with these atomic bombs here ", but you can notice that without losing 77 minutes watching Such a dreck, by the way, that message could have had a little more impact if there had been some money in the budget for the actual sets of the ruins of the Martian city, instead of matte paintings. <br /> <br / > I can appreciate "good" bad science fiction, because of the unique way in which the "future" was seen, and because of the inherent (though condescending) humor that you can find when we remember the naivety of the audience 60 years ago, but this movie must to have been insulting even then. "Rocketship XM" is not even suitable for an MST3K-style skinning.Sometimes, the bad is ... bad. <br /> <br /> Does anyone want to buy a DVD? time, I swear.
