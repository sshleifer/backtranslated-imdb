In a way, I liked this movie because of a positive and meaningless atmosphere that it conveys. I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but more about that later. First, the characters were a bit silly and one-dimensional. The "good people" had similar physical and character traits and the "bad people" had similar physical and character traits ... mmm. The basic plot was fine (fairly simple and standard), nothing too exciting or objectionable. The main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs, a kind of pleasant fantasy element. However, they had a minimal presence in the film. <br /> <br /> Outside of that, the film kept a good pace and did not get stuck too much anywhere. I liked this about the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot had to do with the idea of ​​"stealing". I think this movie may not have been thought enough, something is wrong, especially if it is a children's movie. I will keep the summary of the following sentence so as not to be a spoiler (omit it if you are worried). The 'good guys' do some theft and do not have the same information that the audience has, so it's just stealing and that's a bad thing for a children's movie. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have children, due to a questionable plot aspect that you would consider passing. However, this whole movie is quite low anyway, so it may not matter. Pass this if you have other interesting options.
