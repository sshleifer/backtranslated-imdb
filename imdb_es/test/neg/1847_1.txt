This has to be one of the worst movies I've had the misfortune to watch. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection hitting the planet Earth with an interruption of EM is fairly fair, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155ºF? The acting was so terrible that I had the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. Honestly, I've seen the wood of my ironing board work less. I'm sorry, but this movie was poor, poor, poor.
