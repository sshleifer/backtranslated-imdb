CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer who lives in Australia. George Greenough, an American by birth, has surfed and photographed himself, his friends and recently the dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using several reinvented cameras that he or he ties to his back, board or boat. In the mid-1970s, he partnered with the editor of Surf Mag and the incipient filmmaker David Elfick to create this interesting visual story about this life and photography. The result is the CRYSTAL VOYAGER feature of 75 minutes. Even in the 70s, audiences were a little puzzled with this movie, not a surf movie or a surf movie, because George swims in a children's table, not on a real surfboard ... it compensated George's tedious buzzing (occasionally dry or funny that was actually fun ... as if it almost caught fire or fell on something) with a spectacular "you are there" slide your energy through a wave that ran for 23 minutes , all ready for the music of Pink Floyd. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House opened, it also contained a cinema. The Crystal Voyager booked there as a photo of OZ sports and artistic and, by default, became a success: as the 'opera tickets' cost much more than a movie ticket, the audience came to see this movie as an excuse for 'having been The Sydney Opera House' ... so the film did business as a low-budget attraction for locals and tourists who wanted to tell their neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the movie was a great crowd shooter and the reputation spread. As a result, he teamed up with the cartoon fantasy FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy career for the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it in a coastal movie theater in the 70s and the crowd was quite confused about it. Recently, George has resurfaced in the style of Lord Of The Flies with another well-photographed marine adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE, which offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It's a 20-minute eccentric short with a 20-minute short even more eccentric "how George did it." Both met with a collective yawn of both the media and the public in January 2005 ... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER 'a coincidence' many years ago. However, on a special night of Oz Surf at an outdoor cinema last year, 2000 people showed up ... but then 2000 showed up every night to see something there during the summer movie season ... well that the damn thing hit another binge-box office. How many really enjoyed is very open to debate. Once again, most likely they were baffled by this angry movie with an amazing reputation. Elfick, however, since 1975, has had a stellar career as a producer and an important director of many praised Australian and international films. Look for NO CONCERNS or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or KNOWLEDGE RABBIT KNOWLEDGE or LOVE IN LIMBO for a clear and present applause to your achievements. George, however, is still floating around somewhere drifting and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera.
