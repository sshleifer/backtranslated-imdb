Good enough Every time I think I've seen a movie so unattached, so bad in every way that I think nobody could find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb, where they greet me with the usual madness "Unknowned masterpiece" " GREAT movie "- I mean, honestly, what movie are you watching, because it's certainly not the disaster that I just saw on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three funny lines, and a plot that gives a new meaning to the incoherence. And then, after ninety-three endless minutes, it simply stops and the final credits begin. Then there is another scene. The DVD is pretty miserable, it adapts to the movie. The source material is almost completely discolored to an ugly brown. It's hard to imagine that this movie followed Get Carter. The critics and the public got this at that time: it was criticized and it was a box office disaster, and rightly so. But you experts are still trying. And I'll keep trying to find a movie that DOES NOT have SOMEONE praise about it.
