It's a story as old as man. Jealousy for the wife and other man's possessions. There are even commandments against him. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is the manager of a broker's plantation who wants the owner's wife and feels he is not. It is treated with respect. The wife, the star Barbara Payton, who was trying to return after a series of sordid affairs, was looking forward to Burr, who killed her husband, Paul Cavanagh. <br /> <br /> But lurking was a strange woman, the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything, and who was able to do some voodoo to avenge the wronged, which also included another young woman (Carol Varga) to whom Burr also professed love. <br /> <br /> Burr becomes poisoned and becomes, or believes he becomes, a gorilla. Payton will have to marry Kong if he ever wants to consummate his marriage, since he goes to the jungle every night. <br /> <br /> The ending is predictable. But, the disturbing question in this movie is why Payton would ever be scared. With those pointed missiles sticking out of his chest, no animal could approach her to harm.
