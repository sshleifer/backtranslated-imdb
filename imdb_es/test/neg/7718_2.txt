The terrible and boring zombie sequel is only slightly better than Uwe's horrible first movie. It consists of a group of soldiers who go to a university campus full of zombies to find a certain type of blood that could help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are the typical lambs of the slaughter and none of them is the one that is taken out (or at least it is not very interesting), so you do not feel sadness in the pit of your stomach when you throw them away. The film has the typical zombies that bite humans and splash blood. It even has the same peck in the guts. He just does not do anything for the zombie genre to give him memory. And, the climax of the story is rather anti-climatic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can immerse themselves in an army of zombies and not be bitten (since they are the main stars that seem to always be able to escape) while others seem to be easier to get. The only motivation of the film is to show people that it is little ... nothing more. Just go see a Romero movie for a lasting effect.
