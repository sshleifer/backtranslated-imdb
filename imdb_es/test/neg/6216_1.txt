I do not remember, at least in the last ten years, a movie that I liked less than Mama Mia. From the non-existent performance to the atrocious singing, I was shrinking at least once per minute. I do not think I could remember a brief segment that I tolerated. I know I will never see this disaster again. I can not believe that with such high expectations due to talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that a movie could be a failure. But seeing the lack of acting skills, the dance seemingly induced by drugs and then, the horrors of horrors, listen to the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can not see how this film will not reach the hall of shame. . Definitely, a movie that should never have been made, and in case you missed it the first time, one that I'll never see again.
