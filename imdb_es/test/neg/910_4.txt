The background scene of the phone of the stalker Sean Devine (outside the police station) and the violin (restaurant) of Mr. Lowe's are played with force. But, from the start, it's hard not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers intentionally twists his red paint at the scene of the crime. Unfortunately, this is not an intricate plot point; And, there is worse story stumbling on foot. In general, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there's nothing better, or if you like Lowe and his castmates. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
