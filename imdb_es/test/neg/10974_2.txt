One wonders how FLYNN could have failed as badly as a movie premiere in 1997 with Guy Pearce aptly in the lead role. It is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so correct. FLYNN was a tripping at the box office and did not end up on the movie screens in Australia ... even after THE CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by Guy Pearce) FLYNN has a pretty solid and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out of steam after the first 35 minutes and with the entry of Hammy Steven Berkoff on a detour to New Guinea (looking and acting as if he wanted the role of Klaus Kinski in FITZCARRALDO) the movie starts to look like a TV More than a great cinematographic biography. Believe it or not, around 70 minutes long, it's boring and you're glad to see it finished. But such a promise! Pearce is Flynn! But the movie caused a riot at the box office and, unlike The Bounty, sank without a trace.
