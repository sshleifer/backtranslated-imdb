This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), among the so-called "Poverty Row" movie studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little is spent on doing it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgettable. The cast member Gerra Young exhibits a voice of operatic quality, but it's a kind of discount from Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database does not show any other cinematic appearance for her, so let's hope she was able to move to some kind of position in Grand Opera. Classic films indicates that this film has been preserved by the National Film Museum. This immediately raises the question WHY? <br /> <br /> Are your resources so plentiful that you can afford to keep the garbage? Some low budget musicals or B of that time have redeemable features that make them worthwhile. This movie does not have any. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, skip this movie. REALLY wastes an hour of your time.
