Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes up after seeing this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I saw many bad movies in my life, but after seeing this one, I only had two questions: 1) It's just a parody (spoof) <br /> 2) How Could people create such a thing? <br /> <br /> If you never saw this "movie", then you REALLY do not know what a "movie" REALLY bad is. I mean BAD. The script - are you kidding? Acting is so horrible that I think "the actors" have fun in this movie. I know, this is the movie "B", but come on? Does this have to be a reason to be a garbage? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an ending! We must miss the end! Just when you think this is the worst you've seen, wait until the end, because THAT is the kind of ending you've NEVER seen before (and I hope you never see it). <br /> <br /> Suppose this "movie" at any cost, and do not say that I did not warn you ...
