Could anyone explain why someone would want to make a "neo-noir British" crime movie with an almost entirely American cast? The accents spoken in this movie are horrible! But totally in line with the performances, which are so hard, one is afraid to find a partner to burn the cast. <br /> <br /> Actually, what kind of disgusting, silly and cynical is this? Even neo-noir movies have some character that you feel or want to feel, even if they are miserable and condemned; at least they have some decency with them, some feel that what they have done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that they somehow have the responsibility to do it. <br /> <br /> Not in this stew stew. These characters are putrefied, they betray each other, themselves and the public. <br /> <br /> Also, keep in mind that they are people with little life, in agreement, there is nothing wrong with that, except that they seem to be living a life. deluxe. For a movie supposedly about desperate little thieves, the keynote here is: ennui. Everything is so terribly boring and unpleasant, I do not know. So we're going to cheat some people or maybe kill them, and go fuck in a luxury hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> Bringing all this mess to a swampy mud bottom is: a boring and uneven rhythm; Predictable sequences of 'action' that are not; Banal and incoherent scenography; camera work and editing for bad TV; forgettable score and a total lack of imagination or innovation in production and direction. <br /> <br /> Totally unbelievable, unpleasant, and for moviegoers (or masochists) less dedicated like me, absolutely impossible to see. <br /> <br /> There are other unpleasant things that I would like to say about this unpleasant movie, but they would not be printed here. Suffice to say that you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than see this movie, almost anything, in fact.
