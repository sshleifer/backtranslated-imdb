Another film of the country of the Swedish hills, which is always the northern part. If blacks were shown in this way, there would be shouting about racism and for good reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the "smart" clich√©s. But it is especially annoying. A comedy of gangsters, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And, of course, the stupidest of all is Norwegian, according to Stockholm's prejudice. <br /> <br /> Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a representation that reminds us of reality. This is not funny. This is not even exciting. A burlesque too raw to be interested in any way.
