I do not want to look like a nepal sport, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such a huge change in the timeline, how could it be that the butterfly had been incinerated by the pyroclastic explosion? of the volcano erupting anyway? And, how can time travelers return to the same times and not meet with their previous and subsequent beings who were also in those same minutes on the timeline? It seems that there was a large crowd standing in front of that dinosaur carrying. <br /> <br /> Although I can accept the idea of ​​a wave of time, I seriously doubt that the wave would have caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that had occurred would have happened at the same time during the passage of that wave. Then, cross out the idea that the city begins to be covered in jungle. And why the jungle? The location of the city would still be at the latitude and longitude that it had before and would have had the right vegetation to its geographical place on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical follies. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This movie is a weird combination of some pretty decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Very badly. A fantastic idea of ​​history that was ruined by silly science. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even bother to check the script to see if it makes any real sense?
