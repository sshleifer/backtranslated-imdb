Watch this movie ... just to truly appreciate how good the original is. I'm not too hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It hurt me deeply, because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The writing was simply terrible! I thought Chevy would have at least some things better than him. There was almost nothing to laugh about in this movie. I entered it with desire to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh but I almost cried. <br /> <br /> The initial credits read Special Appearance by Chevy Chase. This worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually in more than I thought it would be. It is more than a "special appearance". Too bad the appearance was not special. Mason's character would have been a good secondary character, but he grew older as a principal. I would rather have seen more (much more) of Dyan Cannon. At least his character was funny, if not well written. I also missed the free teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from being cute and innocent to an annoying rodent that deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that interested me and we did not see enough of him. <br /> <br /> I return it. Try ... see half of this movie, then ... remember the Alamo, the Maine and the CaddyShack I.
