Well, here we have a zombie movie that maybe is not even a zombie movie. The whole film is set in the near future riddled with zombies, but still the film does very little with this concept. Instead, it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money from a group of other bounty hunters. Anyway, what good is money when almost everyone has gone to hell and cities are almost desolate? And why pay people money for killing zombies in the first place? As if people did not continue to kill these dangerous threatening monsters when they are not paid. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the story of "The Quick and the Undead" is far from difficult. Of course, it is not full of the most logical and interesting moments, the characters or the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's still not a completely horrible movie. It's certainly not as bad as some people try to make you believe that it is. He's pretty handsome, or rather, the movie at least does not look cheap. It is possible that the effects are a little used but, nevertheless, they are quite attractive, as well as the makeup effects. <br /> <br /> Even so, the movie was not what I expected. Its title might suggest that the film is set in the wild and wild west during the days of the cowboys, but its title is simply deceptive, no doubt chosen to capitalize on it. I fell in love with her, hoping that this movie was a combination of a western and a bloody zombie horror movie. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies, this movie will be a big disappointment. Of course, it does not add anything new to the genre, but it does not have enough of the genre in itself to be considered good to see. <br /> <br /> It is not totally impossible to identify, but it is also far from being a recommendable one. . <br /> <br /> 4/10
