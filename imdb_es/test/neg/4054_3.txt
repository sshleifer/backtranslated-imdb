The Tender Hook, or, Who Killed the Australian Film Industry? Case No. 278. Does this apology excuse for a period drama have a cast and an idea with potential? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a gangster drama of the Jazz era. and turns it into a soporific of neglected and executed rhythm. McHeath (Weaving) is a boxing promoter, gangster and illiterate in operation; For no apparent reason, he has been singing songs by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before the fighting. How postmodern. How stupid Anyway. There is a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes the last protege of McHeath, above his unfortunate Aboriginal partner Alby (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> The fluttering of McHeath Iris (Byrne) makes the goo-goo have eyes on him. Sexual tension crushes beneath the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls are held together) who continues to appear in scenes without warning. They practice dancing together and talk about "connecting" with the kids. In the 1920s. I stopped counting anachronisms after that. There is a secondary plot that involves Japanese beer and a background story of the Broome pearl fishermen. I do not know what it was about. For some reason, that is not explained (at all), Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath thinks he's a drunk and dismisses him. Byrne plots and plans to help him again. She is a big one for conspiracy and machination. Most of which cause problems. The two guns of McHeath, the corpulent Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), debate on McHeath when he realizes his role in one of Iris's plans, but Ronnie is scared when he sees McHeath crying. A lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the way of the ending film. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson creating some beautiful images, but fails to generate a sense of style, which could have compensated for and decorated the tenuous, pathetically weak script ; unfortunately, the meaning of the grammar of Ogilvie's cinema, the lack of structuring of the scenes and the exhibition, is incredibly incompetent. In an early scene, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. How he got there, and in fact who she is, seems to have slipped Ogilvie's mind. There are many more examples of this oversight. Where he pursues the poetic shortage, he achieves only a slight irritation. He gets uncomfortable interpretations of normally trustworthy actors, misinterpreting Weaving and relying on Byrne's ability to project a kind of humanity like an obsessed doll while loading it with an incomprehensible character. <br /> <br /> It may not matter that much. Much more if the story had more substantial characters and a stronger plot, preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir movies and adorned with witty pop culture quotes from pop culture. But it does not. It's boring.
