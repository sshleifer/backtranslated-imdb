Terrible action movie in which the leader Franco Nero changes his cowboy hat, belt and coffin he dragged in DJANGO (1966) for a completely white ninja costume with all the elegant paraphernalia that accompanies it. Despite the virtually uninterrupted action, the film is completely clich√© and, unintentionally, fun, with a fashion villain, in Christopher George, to boot. Susan George (no relation) is the attractive woman with a lost husband, the war companion of Nero, whom the villains try to get away from their oil-rich land, but the latter has not counted on the martial arts of Nero -weight) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a Ninja with similar abilities for themselves, which turns out to be the deadly enemy of Nero (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently involved in another). The climax takes place in an arena where the one-man army Nero 'eliminates' George and what remains of his gang of previous clashes; However, the subtle way in which he dispatches his nemesis is done effectively.
