The narration was clear and concise, but in general the film never captured my interest: the scenes felt flat and uninspired. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting / epic life, but the film failed to capture that, but focused on small skirmishes like a youth and a love story that I think I've seen disguised in a lot of other movies. I never felt sympathy or empathy for the protagonist. Yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then it seemed he had an easy way to picket, kill and cross twice to get to the top. The only redeeming quality was photography, the landscapes certainly helped the desolate atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the desolation of history, I was left impassive and disappointed.
