Before dismissing my publication as "I do not understand", let me tell you that I am one of the greatest fans of Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone". Donnie Darko is one of my favorites of all time and I even thought that Southland Tales had its moments. I'm a big fan of science fiction. I was very excited to see "The Box", I could not wait for it to come out. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me to Hell", this was the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it will not simply end! When you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you go to more torture. Actually I was moaning in the theater at the end of the movie ... I could hardly stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "The Box", no matter how you cut or try to justify it. It just makes little sense. Trust me, I "understood" it, I understood what was happening. But that does not mean that it makes much sense to look back. Let's take the basics, for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at work, and then tells her husband they are "paying a salary to another." Well, sell that F-ing Porsche that your husband drives then! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a beautiful subdivision. Marsden is working on what appears to be a well-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And, yes, Marsden drives a car too expensive. But are they living somehow one salary to another? It is not necessary to press the button, just reduce your expensive lifestyle a little! The film would have worked better if they had shown the unemployed and indebted couple. Instead, they seem desperate for money ... while living everything I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said, you can understand what's going on, but it still makes little sense! That is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible scene in a library that I think will become one of the worst segments of film history (by the way, terribly acted). He was idiotic, illogical and out of place. Actually, I can not even begin to describe it completely, so I'll move on to a secondary plot that involves bleeding from the nose and possession of bodies by extraterrestrials. (Yes, I'm seriously speaking unfortunately). A child is in Diaz's class with a wicked smile and a smile on his face (a sinister smile that apparently goes completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at school). He starts asking personal questions to Diaz, literally embarrassing her in front of his class. No punishment is given to the child ... he was not even asked to stay after the class to talk! Then, Diaz is at a party ... and the same child is one of the contracted helpers ... ironed shirt, apron and everything! I do not know many children possessed by extraterrestrials (who seem to be in high school) who are also in the moonlight like a bus boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we found one here! (Look at what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still does not make sense ... a weird combo!) Like many things in the movie, the child comes and goes ... there is no explanation real about him, not ending with his character. Continuing ... A lady approaches Diaz at a grocery store and tells him that the experiments are being conducted in secret and that her family is one of the test subjects. Well ... mmm ... if the aliens possess the powers to control a body from a distance ... and the aliens do not want to help Diaz ... then who took charge of this lady's body and gave it to her? advice to Diaz? ! Once again ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling his body ?! Never explained. I never spoke again. No, nothing!! It goes on and on and on and on, what I thought, 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-filming at some point. It was badly edited. Diaz's accent was there a minute, he went the next. The subplots started but never ended. The numerous delays of the launch date obviously show the problems that the producers had with the finished product. It's really a train crash. <br /> <br /> This happens ... there is no redeeming value at all. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and science fiction! But it probably deserves 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
