Why bother watching this movie? It probably qualifies an award for being the worst career move of a great movie star since Rise played an Irish patriot at Parnell. the lucrative Hollywood career, where he could choose between the best scripts and directors that were offered at that time. For starters, there was no script to work with, except a few notes. So we're supposed to believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do everything possible to get out of a refugee camp, including marrying a poor Italian fisherman he does not even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, that made much more sense than throwing the luminous Bergman in such a proletarian part. But because she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window. <br /> <br /> So you are going to live in this poor village where men must strive to extract a poor life from the sea. A place that she obviously hates and where it does not fit. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is the village priest who knows that she is not ready for the life of a poor fisherman's wife, but tells her that for that. for the sake of love, she must repress her true feelings of repulsion and accept the poverty and despair she finds every day. Besides all this, there is a volcano that is always about to erupt and drown them in hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman rebels against his misery by declaring war on almost everyone else in this sad movie. He even goes so far as to try to seduce the priest of the village, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. Since her poor husband bitch must lock her in a room to prevent her from escaping, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to get her off the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; No inaccessible man if he is willing to help her escape the island and her misery. I will not bother to tell you how all this ends. The end of the film without a script is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (having seen it on nightly television) that it had two different endings! Then, be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this giant turkey and catch the Bergman. It took her to her fall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was convicted of sleeping with her director while she was still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films he made with this director (whom he later married) are worth mentioning, except as proof of a crazed race. It is not a joke. It is quite shameful. <br /> <br /> - - Soundtrack
