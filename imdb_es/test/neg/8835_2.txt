I have no idea how commentators could consider this as a decent Western B. Or how one commentator said that the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is a great sequence! It's an affront to the noble western films of the 30s. I've seen many of Wayne's first westerns, Lone Star and Republic, and this is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The bad boy is known as The Shadow, for shouting out loud! Initially, The Shadow's scheme is to keep the open-face scenario coaches. Simultaneously, his gang creaks all the cattle in the territory. Then they decide to go to the robbery of a bank. To do this, they have to shoot the city with a machine gun, there is no explanation as to why it is necessary or how they got that little toy! <br /> <br /> No outline is disclosed in sufficient detail to suggest a plot here. The Shadow is obviously a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally bad schemes. <br /> <br /> He imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake safe. (Knocking on the door, who is there?) Apparently he is clairvoyant, because every time his henchmen need to talk to him, they hit the wall, the safe opens and - PRESTO - he is there. (I imagine he met them face to face and says, "I have some secret and perverse instructions to inform you about our next evil action. Find yourself in the safe on the wall and I will give them to you.") The reason for the that the Shadow requires that the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is, like most elements of this mess, never explained. <br /> <br /> It has an ingenious tunnel towards the old hole. stump across the street from where point of view, several of his bad guys carry out murders. It also has a hidden panel NOT in its secret den behind the fake security box, but in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he is not behind the safe, he hangs on his ranch without cows, pretending to be the rancher. Matlock. We learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch, two brothers, and assumed the identity of one. The dead brother's daughter has just arrived from New York City in 1930 (judging from her wardrobe), and apparently she never met her real uncle, because he cheats on her too! <br /> <br /> If you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good white hats kids, you need to see this movie. Here, all the good guys get rid of their hats in favor of the white hair bands that make them look like they've all suffered head injuries before the shots have been fired! It's like a pick-up basketball game: only Wayne makes them tie handkerchiefs around their heads instead of just taking off their shirts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the strangest of all is the end. Immediately after submitting to the Shadow and its gang, we jumped long enough to see Wayne and his wife (the oldest niece) on the front porch of his house. (It does not matter that there has been little romance). There, Yak is playing with Wayne's 3 to 4 year old son, dressed in the Injun outfit! (Hiyoo, fun skookum!) <br /> <br /> No, thanks to this nonsense, Wayne became a screen legend. Only a superstar (packaging or not!) Could overcome this entry in a resume. Long live the duke!
