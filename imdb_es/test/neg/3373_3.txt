-Can contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> Clearly, whoever made this movie must have had many connections. I just can not see it any other way. What really amazes me is that no one used the name of Allen Smithee and, what is more surprising, everyone involved did not use this name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, where to start. The bad dialogue, the disguises, the unfortunate aspect film, the unintentional comedy, the exaggerated characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's university career. I do not know what was more fun, the guy who lost his arm due to a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the Jack Frosts babies were killed. In addition, one of the great lines of all time was pronounced in this film. "How do we know what he is?" As if there were another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp movie, but a very bad movie in general.
