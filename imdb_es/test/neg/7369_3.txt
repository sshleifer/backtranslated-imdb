Despite decades of fiscal incentives, in terms of international visibility, the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind most of the central and Islamic states of Africa (surprisingly, few Canadian films are released outside their native coasts), and Nouvelle-France, also known as Battle of the Brave, is another example of why. More than any other country, the Canadian commercial cinema seems incapable of developing its own identity and is caught in the pale imitation of the failures of other countries. On paper, this historical drama may seem vaguely promising. Certainly, there is a large vein of unexploded material in the history of Canada, as the French and the English clashed, bought and sold the colony, although none of that is reduced here unless you have the strange scene of blinking and Missing characters who say "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no more" before returning to the soap opera. But while this is not a history lesson, neither is it a drama or epic adventure that promises the new title: there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of bombing by half a dozen reenactors and one collapsed shed. The city square, which is all we see in Quebec, is a rather obvious studio interior with flat lighting, which gives many scenes a television miniseries look, as does the reluctance of director Jean Beaudin to offer much in terms of long shots or even external. What you get for your money is a simple but prolonged harlequin romance about condemned lovers, constantly separated by events beyond their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. It is the kind of movie in which, when two characters are about to become the beast with two backs, the camera approaches a chimney or waterfall furious and convenient. <br /> <br /> An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that does not. So much to unite the nations once in war as to throw any country with a decent tax relief to the stew, this huge disaster at the box office was clearly destined to be the Titanic of Canada, although somebody refused to tell the producers that They were referring to the movie, not the ship. - But it is more similar to the Revolution made at low cost without the battle scenes, the crowds or the few moments that threaten to work briefly before the overwhelming possibilities. The Montreal mirror described him as "so bad that one can not even find the strength to mock him". That's pretty unfair, because while most of its run time seems like a miniseries below the 80's average, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally putting their legs in traps for bears, husbands husbands declare "Never again, see your handsome lover, honor of Cuckold! You will pay for this, both of you!" and our heroine accused of murder and ... panting! - Witchcraft in a test funny enough to have been in the Demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter. In the end, add to the British governors, devious slaves and Celine Dion singing, and you'll have something that sometimes looks like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines aspired to (and still managed to miss) his legendarily inept period. The War of the Worlds version, although without the amazing technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> The versatility of leading man David La Haye seems limited to the amount of other actors he may seem to over the course of the film: start Luciendo como Andy García, briefly adopt the look Al Pacino's Revolution , flirts with the shaved style Tchéky Karyo before becoming a younger Ted Danson as his character ages. While his opening scene where he reacts to the news of his father's death with an expression that seems to be waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a party of bad acting, it actually gives the impression of a more mediocre support. Actor who was lucky in the lead at the last minute when the one who was originally chosen finally read the script and was rescued. He is willing and gives an opportunity, but the grace and charisma that the part needs are simply not there. The impersonator of Noemie Godin-Vigneau, by Billie Piper, does not light the screen exactly in spite of occupying the center of the stage like the peasant girl who is prey to the laughter of the corrupt and perverted mayor Le Bigot of Vincent Perez (who really is the name of the character), the duplicate lazy drunk lackey Sebastien Huberdeau and, saddest of all, the dirty old priest of Gerard Depardieu with a gray-haired wig. It is a truly unfortunate sight to see a great actor in the absolute depth of his game as he shuffles the moves and it seems that he has not only lost the will to act but the will to live with him. Clearly, he could not be bothered to stay for dub sessions in English (or even a couple of long shots in which he doubles noticeably). No wonder he talked about retiring at the time of the film's brief release. <br /> <br /> Jason Isaacs provides a brief comic relief in his default Patriot mode, which excessively plays Wolfe of Quebec more than an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played with Timothy Dalton in speed, while William Pitt, by Tim Roth, stands on the sidelines with the strange smile of someone who is being housed in a nice enough hotel with excellent room service and many days of rest, though like the Benjamin Franklin of Colm Meaney Re both in the film by less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour poke their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well, but they do not make any impression, comical or otherwise). The supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as real and adopted daughters of the heroine and a surprisingly beautiful Irene Jacob who seeks out the whole world as a young Fanny Ardant is refreshingly good and deserves much better.
