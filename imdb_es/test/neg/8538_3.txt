First, the editing of this movie consisted of a major flaw that I do not understand how it was overlooked: the microphones are constantly seen at the top of the movie. The first time I saw it, I just said "well, mistakes happen" and I discarded it. After about the tenth time, it began to become incredibly irritating and distractingly fun. If you have not seen the movie yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; It could be a pretty interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie. This movie started with the ingredients of a fairly solid story of "ghosts"; However, the twist of the plot ultimately ruined it completely. You begin to see the movie under the assumption, alluded to by television commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts that only children can see; especially to young children, which makes it even stranger, since they will not be able to warn the family of the imminent danger. The opening scene did a good job of deceiving the audience that this would remain the premise of the movie. ** (SPOILER) ** The movie begins when the family is harassed and finally killed by an "invisible" force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts starts when the daughter, at the beginning of the movie, asks her little brother to tell him where he is "right" before he "grabs" her and dragged her screaming to the basement. . The young man also witnesses this supposed "invisible force" that kills his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After they kill their family, the child tries to run and hide only to be snatched as well. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie started with the ingredients of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would do it. being harassed by an "invisible force" with his only hope of survival resting on sightings of a two-year-old child. This began to ruin less than half the movie when the daughter also began to see the ghosts; completely ruining the illusion "only children can see" established by the commercials and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Regardless of this, the film was not "ruined" until the plot twisted at the end. In which the man who had been helping the family to farm the farm turned out to be the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man shoots and tries to kill the mother, the daughter and the son while suffering a psychotic collapse in which he believes that they are HIS family; who killed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The complete turn of the plot at the end just created a complete list of unresolved questions and left me alone. First, why were the souls of the family trapped in a house? If the director opted for a Ju-On approach (The Grudge) in which the family, after dying in a fit of rage, would chase the house and kill whoever enters, why did the spell stop after that the father was "captured" The ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man who killed them, why were they attacking the new family? Here is another one for you. It takes several months from the moment you sow the seeds until the plants bloom completely in time for the harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man who apparently had a grudge against the whole movie, lived on the property for months. During all this time, why did not the ghosts kill him? <br /> <br /> This movie includes a lot of fears of "horror movies" as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However, I tell you that this movie could still have gone well if it was not for the plot's twist at the end. It is as if they had run out of budget and had put together something for an end. For this film to have been a success, they should have stayed with the premise of "only children can see them" and end up with the family has barely escaped or be killed as family at the beginning (would have opened the door for possible sequel, as well).
