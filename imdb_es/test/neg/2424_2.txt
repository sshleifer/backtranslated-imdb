This film, like so many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of the sports film: there is a boy, he is an imbecile. Jerk does wrong. Jerk must play by someone else's rules. Someone else's rules change to Jerk, Jerk becomes good. Insert tragedy (Death, drugs, riots, etc.). The tragedy affects Jerk, it makes him change completely. Jerk must now play a championship game. A lot of close-ups on the sweaty players and the balls. Jerk wins. Coach's appointment or news or something that explains the title. Credits You were not touched? These movies can now be used to order the idiots of society. Anyone who pays to see this in theaters should be slapped.
