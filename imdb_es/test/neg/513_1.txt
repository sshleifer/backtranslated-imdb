Don Wilson plays Jack Cutter (Ooh, a really hard name!) A vampire killer who confronts an army of vampires. The story is a little different because vampires can not be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight, but through their necks (how convenient it reduces the budget) and it is here that Cutter meets a journalist (Melanie Smith of the fame of Trancers III). It only makes the movie more jarring. What's worse is that these fight sequences are irrelevant, since Wilson's martial art is disguised by a disjointed edition. Of course, the greatest interest comes from the fact that, indeed, this precedes Blade, however, the problem is that this was done with a small budget and that had Don Wilson in it. It's by Roger Corman and, basically, this turkey is a movie that most people would pay to NOT watch. Unfortunately I am a fund feeder and I attend the store section in search of gems, in this line of work you always run into turds. With Night Hunter, I can have the most stinky basket in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (horrible)
