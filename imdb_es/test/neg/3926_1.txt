The performance is better than the grade I have given to this work, simply because I will not support a film that shows any child or person with mental problems how to obtain, cook and inject narcotics into their bodies. <br /> <br /> This is an unpleasant film, which is useless in the world, but to glamorize and try to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It carries convincing performances, which add to my displeasure. What were THESE people thinking ?! I could not enjoy a movie like this. It is enough to make someone who has never used drugs, think about it, and those who have redeemed themselves and redeemed themselves, consider the reversal. I'm surprised he does not make all the drug addicts who see him fall off the car. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in this "movie", which looks more like a How to Get Nervous document. drama. This is the epitome of what is wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Rate a 1.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil:.
