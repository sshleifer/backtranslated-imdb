The only thing that matters about this movie is its theme. Looking at the "family" of Manson from the point of view of the members of the family is a great idea. However, trying to make sense of the incomprehensible is something that can really only be achieved in a masterpiece, and this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Presumably because there was a lot of information to include in a script, this film was made in a false documentary style, with recreations. The problem is that writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a film visible, such as the character, the story, the theme, etc. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, there is an incredibly weak secondary plot that follows a small band of mansonites from the past few days chasing a reporter who is working on a story about the anniversary of the murders. It is silly and meaningless, and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a great missed opportunity. The only ray of sunshine is the performance of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life did most of the actual murders. While the female characters emerge as hollow heads in the flashbacks of the 60s, Pitman manages to convey real feelings. <br /> <br /> In short, do not bother with this movie.
