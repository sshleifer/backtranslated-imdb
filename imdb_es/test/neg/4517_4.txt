I found my tape of this 'show' forgotten a long time ago. In addition to the song of the song 'DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE'. This show can hardly be seen. You'll be flipping through the channels, just like the couple flipping through TV channels. This is a parody of television. <br /> <br /> The beaver is great. Homosexual Dracula, the girl who talks about her experiences with Peria and the woman with too big lips talking about homosexuality, shows us everything that is wrong with television. Everything is bad. Like the beaver of outer space that seems to be lost in this new world, you will be too. *** outside *****
