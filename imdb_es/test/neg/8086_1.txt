This movie, literally, does not have a redemption function. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©s, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script seems like it's improvised from another 100 movies, the acting is horrible, and some of the 'disgusting' humor made me feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed, Gregory Poirier, for ANY of this would be fun or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in several years.
