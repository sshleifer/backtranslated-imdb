For starters, I love Steven Seagal, man is a genius. But recent films leave me wondering: Are you trying more? His latest films show almost no effort from Seagal. In Out of Reach, it's all too obvious that your lines are doubled. . What Seagal does in this film is not only a slap for his fans, but also more for Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene, more or less, as he prepares to enter the zip line in the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, he shows him how to install the gun and place it on a neon sign. You may be saying to yourself: 'Yes, what does this have to do with Van Damme?' Well, that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called The Order. Rent both, look both, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die trash, but it was, dare I say, an insult. Seagal's Aikido movements are still good, but why is not he making great films like Marked for Death or Above the Law? He still has the movements and attitude, I just ask myself 'Why Seagal, why?'. There are such idiotic scenes in his new films that have nothing to do with the story, and such idiotic story lines above that. I hope that the next Black Dawn movie is another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because this last string of films that he made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he has the things to make more action films like Double Team. . Please, do not watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love his films, do not see them, they will make you question his future in the action film genre.
