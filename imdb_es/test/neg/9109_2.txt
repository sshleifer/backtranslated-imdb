** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Ok, let's conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Very bad. Now, why do I think that? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg leads a special operations team of four people who are assigned to re-take a lethal virus after being robbed by a weapons dealer from a laboratory. They do it by attacking the arms dealers in mid-flight and, somehow, recover the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions about Guttenberg arise because one of the terrorists knew his name. After informing team members, they are attacked by unknown people and all begin to suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding that they can not trust their bosses, they decide, once again, to steal the virus and try to attract the possible attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory, this is a plot that could have worked in a low budget. Film that only pretends to be transmitted by television. However, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. First of all, the plot is totally predictable and it's not fun to know how the film will end after three minutes. Second. The acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act like dummies. There are not many emotions, change of facial expressions, etc. I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I think he can do much more, but he fails completely in an attempt to be a tough action hero. Also, although I am by no means an expert on the subject, I totally believe that I could assemble a better covert operations team by picking up five strangers and training them for a week. This seems to be a theme in the movie to do things in the most stupid and unprofessional way possible. This goes for the good guys, the bad guys and the spectators too. So, I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical advisers, if any, of the film. For example, I have poured liquid nitrogen into my hand and I have not broken instantly. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to really conclude this, but let's say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting. and they seem to be amateurs in whatever they do. I'm sorry, it can not be better than that. Do not look at this movie, it's not even that bad, it's funny. 2/10
