Well, from the point of view of an American, who I guess I do not know much about rugby, this would be an incredible movie for them. First of all, the heart is good, the good moral is the typical good coach who tries to change the bad boy. However, for us, where I come from, rugby is the number one sport, it's a way of life, it's a game played only by the bravest and the victors are acclaimed as heroes as if the Americans did for their baseball stars / basketball. I'm not really sure if it was the cheap budget or maybe the director or the actors knew very little about rugby and as rugby fans all my life I can see that some of the actors did not even know that rugby existed before acting in this movie. . In summary for me this movie was terrible. If you look at it and think it was great, please take the time to connect and maybe with Google "All Blacks", this is the national team of New Zealand and those who made the haka famous. Believe me, they'll make the Highlands kids look like the girls at school
