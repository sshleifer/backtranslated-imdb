Even those of us who like photos of cute animals (and I detest them) would find it hard to find any merit in this abysmally bad parody of a movie. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with their intelligent and loyal dogs, their dumb and twisted humans and their predictable "happy" and predictable ending, the alternative title "101 Turkeys" comes to mind. That would cover all those involved in their unfortunate production. I dismissed it as a perverse perversion of British Hollywood customs before I learned, to my horror, that it is actually a Canadian movie, made in Victoria BC, that fake British theme park in a city, while sucking up tax dollars from Ottawa ON, which equally false pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me tell you the ways it is bad. The dizzy plot? The script asinino? Shady performances and the direction of the second year? The very intelligent animals? The endless clich√©s and the predictable slapstick? On second thought, neither I nor those of us navigating in IMDb have time for a complete catalog of their failures. However, if I had to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. Believe me, it's bad; a landmark monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible cinema (Canadian). If you have already seen it, my condolences. If you have not done so, move away from him as you would with SARS or the bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Do not even allow your children to see it, lest their diminutive minds be distorted by the even smaller minds of those who funded, fabricated and filmed this frightful madness. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I'll have a nightmare with frightening beasts hanging from the bed table as I flee in a frantic flight. I hope so. It will be a much better thing to do than see this bestial banal beast. But then, I could dream that I had to see it a second time and pure terror and cold sweat make me want to stay awake all night, trembling at the possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. You might even find something worth seeing instead. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack of killer tomatoes" Maybe the instructional video for my integrated vacuum.
