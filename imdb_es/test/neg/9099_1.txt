When you look at the first moments, you realize that it's going to be a parody, and it's certainly a parody, but I'm not sure what (a fairy tale, an opera, a Hollywood movie), if there was such a thing), and I can assure you that it is not worth seeing them. It is simply a meaningless movie (see a good parody is anything but useless), with pretentious and superficial speeches of extremely schematic characters. It's like a comedy dell'arte. Or better, it's like a comedy dell'arte failed. And the score ... sung in an intentionally incompetent manner (something that Greenaway will use much more efficiently), * is * painful to listen to (unless you use some ear plugs last generation, haha). Opt for quality films (for example, A. Mitta, How the Tsar, Peter the Great, married Moor, 1976) and avoid this error.
