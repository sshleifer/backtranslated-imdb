QUESTION: How does a movie deserve two different titles like "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The film is so bad that the filmmakers could not even decide a title! <br /> <br /> This movie is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death-vendettas, melodrama, romance and other clich√© cinema techniques. The story centers on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is looking for a nefarious, multilingual and branded creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) that captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this movie, and his scene is totally alien to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest accents I've heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather." <br /> <br /> Also appears in this film Erika Eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of the strange world of Marcos. The character of Erika is transformed into an alliance with Simon. The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful force of attack against evil in a film that was delivered directly from the editing room to its cable television converter box.
