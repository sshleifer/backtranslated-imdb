The things that I find irritating on the screen, the things I mention and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are the moments when the writer, the director, the set designer, the on-screen catering service provider or whoever , do not think Until the end and, by a single act of omission, or commission, undo all the work done by all others who have worked on the film. That moment of "Wait a bloody moment ... What just happened?" That stops the dead narrative in its tracks. (It's not that the narrative of this movie has had to stop long, because anyone who has seen it will know that Quintet's narrative impulse has frozen quite well before the end of the initial shot). There are several of those moments in this movie. And you have so much time to think about them, too. The movie is two hours long and the script dialogue probably extended to five pages. There is a lot of time to reflect on its deficiencies. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a frozen Earth. Another ice age has been established and the whole world is dying. It's cold. Very cold. It's really cold on the screen. The film was filmed in Canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow, and the breath of people gushes from their mouths in every scene. Again and again we are reminded of how cold it is. People wear big hats, capes and layers of clothes, and they walk like weeble people dressed. It must have been a horrible shooting. My nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero registers in a hotel room. Awakened in the middle of the night by the voices coming from the next room, he hears a conversation of vital importance for the scant plot through a large grill on the wall that divides the two rooms. I am not questioning why there is a convenient grill on the wall between the two rooms. What bothered me was the fact that the grill had not been blocked by the long-term tenant with the noisy visitor. If you're trying to stay warm, the last thing you need is a huge hole in the wall that leads to an unoccupied, unheated room. Trust me. I live like that, I saw this movie sitting on the couch in my living room under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath clouded as much as that of the actors. If that big knocking hole were on my wall, I'd block it with something. Maybe it's not the best movie option to see in an unheated room in the middle of winter, but it did make me notice the terrible insulation in the movie.
