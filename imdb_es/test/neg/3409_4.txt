First of all, just to say that I did not get the edition, I thought I would do it; I chose the Italian version instead of R2, but what really came was a release in the UK since 1998, which claimed to be a special edition, I never knew it existed. DVD release in the UK, but the promised biogs were not really on the disc, just a couple of Duff's trailers. Anyway, as for the movie itself, just as I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders", my second genital mutilation thriller appeared the same month, this time in (an Italian) nubile schoolgirls from the UK are being offended and Professor Fabio Testi - (unhappily) got married, but stayed with one of his students, he became the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the case detective. I'm sorry to say that I was less than fascinated. It was observable but more than equally impossible, and apart from the frightening nature of the aforementioned crime, Cristina Galbo's "surprise" murder, which was actually "spoiled" by the cover of the DVD, she told me: Grrrrrr !! and a surprise turn that threw the "victims" in a new light: I thought this was very routine. However, he did not take away the two "sequels." with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit on your grave ") Keaton.
