A fairly transparent attempt to take money out of the thriving scene of British clubs, Sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does very little else. A plot of superficial suspense (which is simply to unite the club sequences), variable acting and a pretty ridiculous script, all this is no longer the showcase that director Jovy obviously intended. <br /> <br /> However, although Jovy is sometimes too lenient (especially when using dance music, which is often not adequate), it shows great potential, and the lack of an anti-drug message is hugely refreshing. However, in general, the movie is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great movie of clubs are kept somewhere. Observable however.
