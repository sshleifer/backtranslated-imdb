The cookie cutter goes to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The plot, as it is, has been done before a billion times, so it is not necessary to retell any of that. Suffice it to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie, while the rest of us will be forced to grimace. Even the soundtrack is horrible! It's not that I do not like figure skating, although I do not, it's that I do not like clich√©, bad films.
