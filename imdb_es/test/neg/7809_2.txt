The young dreamer Ashton Kutcher (as Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Ms. Reid believes that Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, a Seal of Terence Stamp (as Jack Taylor). Kutcher accepts "housesit" for the boss, believing that he will bring him closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has an owl named "O.J.", which becomes a coca head. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to restrict pre-teens "G rated" ready for a more aggressive "R rating". It will help if you have not seen the plot before, and especially as stupid humor. Remember, people are paid to act like this. <br /> <br /> ** My boss's daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
