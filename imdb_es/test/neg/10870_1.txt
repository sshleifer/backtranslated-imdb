This movie is so bad that it's funny. I saw that Hell Ride thought it was a comedy, although I could not understand if they really were taking the p * ss, or if it really was a serious attempt to do something decent. I realize that it does not appear here as a comedy, so you must be serious! Basically, it seems to be a bunch of retired motorcycle riders shooting each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. A scene inexplicably has two characters breaking bottles on the heads of others, and then showing each other the 'get out of prison' cards they made! You can also see Vinnie Jones's accent, where the hell is he supposed to be? Oh, and there are also a lot of naked girls, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than not having sex to stop with these leather * leather bards! The guy who wrote it and directed it, a hairstyle by Pee Wee Herman with a Greeshan 2000 beard and an orange tan, for some reason has been placed in the lead role, maybe it's part of the joke, I do not know. Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure this movie is a p * ss shot. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he launched it with humor as a laugh. It's a total scam of Tarantino's style, but really done very badly. However, it's a lot of fun, and I think it could be a cult classic anyway, either because it's a funny parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style, or something that's really fun without meaning to. Must be seen to be believed.
