This was bad enough: bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots and bad audio (although I was watching a DVD, sometimes I could not hear what they were saying, sometimes I blew my speakers, even in the same conversation) . The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted mainly of neurotic, bi-polar and incredible caricatures. The development of the character was horrible ... the spoiled little sister (why was it written in the script?), The annoying mother (again, with what purpose?) The weeping bride (why did not leave her a long time ago? ?), The gang of 'dark suits' (that original, I can not think of a better name, I suppose), the sexy bride of the drug dealer (you must have a sexy Latina if you're going to have LA gangs, but really ... ), etc. I can not believe what I saw everything.
