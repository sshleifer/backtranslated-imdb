A wonderful semi-humorous tribute to the black and white expressionist films of characters such as FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare, at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group that tries to catch a murderer and gradually realizes that he could be a suspect. The writing is a bit forced (that is, after all, Woody Allen is trying to be a shy Kafka), but the point is clear and there is no harm. The cinematography is interesting, around 100 shades of gray, but be sure to look in a very dark room with a good screen, or the details will be swallowed by the fog. This is a funny little movie with some laughs that are really snorts of "uh-huh". The performance is fine, considering the strange vehicle, and it's worth seeing if you're a big fan of Woody Allen. Also of interest to the connoisseurs of expressionist cinema. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.
