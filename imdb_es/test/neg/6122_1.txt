I think it's very interesting that this movie is called a thriller. It is anything but exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. Then, some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Then, again the pianos sound. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason for me to register for IMDb, because I think this movie is one that you have to warn humanity about. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most action part happens when you pour a can of hot chocolate. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: the "actors". Yes, the quotes are intentional, as you may think, because they do not act. They play the piano and they speak in a low voice, but they are not acting as they do. <br /> <br /> I think that before this movie I never left a cinema and I got angry. Actually, this movie made me angry. Angry at the time and money I spent on him.
