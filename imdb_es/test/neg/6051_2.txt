I really thought this would be a good movie, boy ... I was wrong! For a quick summary: grade B, grade C, special effects, grade D for the film in general. Do not get me wrong, the story was quite good and not childish, so an adult also accompanies him, the "hero" is handsome, so most of the women will like it :-), not a total movie for girls, as it contains some fighting scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it was recorded ... horrible <br /> <br /> special effects-> would be more suitable for TV-> in a children's program <br /> <br /> and finally ... send some of the actors to the acting school if they ever attended a class there. <br /> <br /> Trust me, there are much better ways to lose 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
