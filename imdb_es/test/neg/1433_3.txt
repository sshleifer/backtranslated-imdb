This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen many). Personally, I liked the penetrating interpretation of everything that was original, but other than that, it was quite impossible to see. I could not stand Dee Snider as an actor or as a singer. It seemed he was dealing with everything he said to make it a memorable appointment, which they were not. I can get free movies and I still did not think it was worth it.
