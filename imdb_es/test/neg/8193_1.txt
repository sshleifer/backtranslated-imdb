^^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is total shit. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> There's no one in this movie to unravel, I do not even like it, except for the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish and many things happen that do not make sense. <br /> <br /> At best, the acting is mediocre and everyone breathes too hard for everything. No one can even cry credibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for a second, then something will happen totally outside the left field, and it will not make you NEVER SIT. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the room for a second, while the character of Jennie Garth was sleeping with her manager. I return, seriously about 4 minutes later (I'm also pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere there) and she's sleeping with that Berko boy. <br /> <br /> I gave up on this movie at the time when Berko was being an imbecile to his boyfriend in the car, because she did not want to cancel the wedding. <br /> <br /> I lost 2 hours of my life. You should not
