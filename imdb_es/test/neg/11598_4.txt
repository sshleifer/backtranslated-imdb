Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It is not a hallmark of the history of cinema. What it is is a group of unfunded filmmakers who try to make another movie, make another paycheck and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give a lot of slack to these efforts. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. There are not many big budget movies being made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated group and are more than willing to throw everything they can into any American monster movie that needs affordable SFX. And I'm excited to look for the same locations that appear again and again in these movies. If for some reason you find yourself looking at this again, look at the sequence in which Stop and Company are walking through a "jungle". Look at his feet and you'll see paved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown one or two weeks earlier also in SciFi), you will see people who are walking through the same jungle of ersatz. Now that I think about it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both movies. I can admire the prosperity of these films. Every dollar really appears on the screen! Too bad there are not enough dollars ......
