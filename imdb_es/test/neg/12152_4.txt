For the native speakers of Mongolia, the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Too many non-native speakers are used, especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from current history. Terrible terrible subtitle !!! I wonder where and who made that subtitle. It was in both English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was so bad. He described the life of the best leader very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors on a very low budget since the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the Academy Award film critics are so forgiving or what? The only good thing was a good CGI in some fight scenes only moderately ... not superior to the higher CGI
