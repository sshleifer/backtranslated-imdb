The Italian scam of Mandingo and The Drum is an Italian life very nicknamed in the spinning of the plantation. Many of the people who do not seem to belong to the southern United States wear ill-fitting suits and roam in places that do not resemble anything in the southern United States. The plot has something to do with the romance between a rich man and a certain young man, the jealousy that follows and the tragedy that follows. The film promises hot sex and a lot of twisted violence, but none of that is due to anything, it's all a joke. Probably everything is racially insensitive, I did not notice it since it is in artistic bankruptcy. The final turn is, in the best of cases, ridiculous. A great turkey.
