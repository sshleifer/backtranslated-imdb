The first thing I notice is music. It's nothing so surprising as the disturbing theme of Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust or the waltz in the masterpiece of A Tale of Two Sisters, but I do not let that stop me so early in the movie. <br /> <br /> One must assume that a woman who investigates her hypothesis for her doctoral thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice has never existed, one would think that she should consider them wrong and prepare for the trip, right? Or why go if you already believe that the hypothesis is true even before being tested? That is incredibly ignorant and makes the film seem much more unrealistic and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Actually, it is similar to Ruggero Deodato's film, totally ill-prepared. No weapons, no decent clothes for hikers, just nonsense. <br /> <br /> People do not make trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Things do not have a good start for our brave but stupid adventurers, as they deviate to miss a jaywalking iguana, and their pet ferret It falls off the truck almost for it's disappearance, then fall into a mud hole, well, I think it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Okay, then throw a coin to see if they continue or if they forget everything. How is it that the scene makes any sense? Does all your conviction rest on the release of a coin? After that they must have spent time, money and preparation to leave. This keeps getting worse. Definitely, some of the worst performances, scripts and music ever invented for the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike talks about how he and his friend were captured by the cannibals and placed in cages in mud holes with 3-inch leeches. sucking his blood. I found it interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they meet in the jungle, a man they confuse as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such leeches ... I wonder if they are the same? Really, although this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting has no emotions considering the content. They simply agree to get out of themselves instead of being eaten by cannibals as if it were not a big decision. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Mike is crazy, but like in the first movie, they treat the natives with such terrible behavior that it just is not realistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's film easily feels that Americans got what they deserved, whereas in this film you can hardly blame the natives for what happens to Americans once again. <br /> <br /> And that's why The movie feels a little useless. We already got the point of the first movie, why was the sequel made? Is the lieutenant's name Rizzo? It could be worse? Often, with films like these, when you look at the cast, you find that they have not really acted in many other films and that their biographies are almost non-existent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this movie who was at Scorsese's Gangs of New York. Now, Lieutenant Rizzo seemed familiar and I discovered that he was in the 2002 film Spiderman as a very small role as captain of a tugboat. It reminds me of how William Shatner went from being the admiral of the USS Enterprise to a cop in a car. Irony, sometimes irony works. Shatner could never understand music well until his recent album "Has Been", which is really good, like U2 Bono, could never cut his hair properly, and Dan Marino could never win any Superbowls. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the irony is simply sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can not walk the irony. However, man will always be a legend because he was a great guy, however, I digress one more time. <br /> <br /> At this point, you can say that I'm pretty bored of even talking about Canibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> The message of Cannibal Holocaust was about who the true savages are and what is truly evil. What do the savages do in the unknown natural life for our moral records, or what do we do with others with malicious intent? The message of Cannibal Ferox seems to be 'Be careful what you are looking for, because you could find it'. I'll say this for Canibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her dissertation, affirming that cannibalism does NOT exist, she saves others who would be curious and would go where the angels fear to tread, but in general this movie was really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
