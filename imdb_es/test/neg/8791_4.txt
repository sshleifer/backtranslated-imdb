Ridiculous film where two university graduates move to California and one becomes a movie star and the other one in his manager. <br /> <br /> As 10 years pass, the popularity of the star decreases, so it is determined that TV show where women will compete for their love. <br /> <br /> The movie is detestable and ridiculous. Girls who compete for a lover boy are made to look ridiculous. Only a girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show. She is really an amateur compared to some of the other women, but she is healthy and also brings good grades to the program. <br /> <br /> In the third scene, you realize that the manager is falling in love with her. <br /> <br /> We know that Ryan was really meant to be single. While the ending is something nice, you really know where this was going.
