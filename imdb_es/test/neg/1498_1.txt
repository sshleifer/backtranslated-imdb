Grandma is definitely one of the worst horror films ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The script was diabolical, so bad that I actually almost laughed at some of the things that came out with. The acting was almost as bad, they would have been better throwing traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). The murders were ridiculous, the suspense did not exist, the camera work was ineffective and the "main" turn of the plot at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it only gets worse and worse. <br /> <br /> "La granita" is possibly one of the most threatening "villains" that was filmed in the movie, it seems that she wears a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair caused infinite laughter) and a nightgown with frills. Would you be frightened by that? It certainly was not. <br /> <br /> If you like to watch bad movies (watch the films of Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay,), then this is a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like laughing at a surprisingly bad dialogue, avoid the plague.
