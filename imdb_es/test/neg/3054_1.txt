Dear friends, I had never seen such a trash movie as NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that the director Kevin Tenney had the intention to copy classics like THE EVIL DEAD of Sam Raimi (1978) or George A. Romero RETURN OF THE LIVING LADING DEAD of the same year. The cinematography was terrible, the film was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. In fact, horror images have to be dark, but not like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS. The whole movie was ridiculous, without suspense, worse actors, except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger, and horrible makeup effects. An average 5-star vote for that movie? I can not believe this. Maybe the users were happy with the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, in fact they were worth 5 stars. Greetings, Hans-Dieter
