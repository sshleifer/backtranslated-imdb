I knew it five minutes after the monster made his appearance to where he was going. But when I saw the initial credits, I said, "My God, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (Star Trek), Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and it's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan, who used to star in my favorite soap, All My Childen, put on a few kilos, but he can still act, then there was Veronica Hamill, it's a pity I would not have bothered to see her in the movie, I took 20 minutes out of the movie, I never saw William Katt (Perry Mason, and Greates American Hero). <br /> <br /> All these stars and a bad movie, I hope you have received your paycheck. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Bad
