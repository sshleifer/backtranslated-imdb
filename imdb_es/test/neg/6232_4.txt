As in so many movies of the past, one would think that Hollywood would already learn this, make a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure that the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie wants to remember these basic facts in case it ever happens to any of us. Why the walk in the forest and a boy from the city can really go through the forest without getting lost? Just an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that did not make sense in the end. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to part of the director's comments on the special features section, of the great movements that Redford has done in the past, (sneakers for one) surprised to have agreed to star in a movie of this type. The comments and the director's reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie were the scenarios, I can not wait for spring to arrive.
