Leon Errol manages his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping superbly, but I have problems so that I like the series "Mexican Spitfire" because they are all designed to produce erroneous identities, and these are telegraphed in advance. Errol is funny like the evil Lord Epping, but he would have preferred much more ingenuity and less repetition. <br /> <br />
