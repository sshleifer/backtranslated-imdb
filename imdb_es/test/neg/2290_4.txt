It's not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond film and a new version of "Thunderball", written by Kevin McClory (co-producer in "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are like the original Bond girls, in addition to Rowan Atkinson and a great Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing "M" role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives new impulses. Sean Connery makes him once again confident and charming, except he seems a little old. But hey, he's the original Bond and it was great to see him once again in this role. The locations are also typical: Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is music, the song "Never Say Never Again" is O.K., but the theme song is simply missing. All in one, a good attempt to make a difference with the comic and silly movies of Roger Moore as "Moonraker". Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and I really did not need a remake
