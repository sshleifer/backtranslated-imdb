I just watched this movie last night at a midnight preview screening (I work for an independent theater chain in Colorado, it's one of the advantages) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the movies THE WORST I've seen in my life. I know there are some Bruce Campbell fans out there who (like Star Wars die hards) will hang you from the nearest tree if you dare to speak ill of their beloved cinematographic icon ... however, Campbell-teers, this particular work The Chin is a celluloid black hole. <br /> <br /> Before making any assumption that I'm a movie fan who only watches "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways," think again: I'm a big fan of movies B series, and Bruce Campbell in particular. His character Ash is one of my favorites, and his portrayal of elder Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, the B-series movies still have the potential to be realistic, very bad (and not in that "good" countryside way we all love) ... and that's what it was like to see this in particular for me and for my co-workers. With the exception of that tracking shot in which Bruce runs through the square and scares the children, there was no laughing. In general, we consider that the story is stupid, like the rhythm of the mollas, and the so-called humor more foolish than a bag of hammers. (Sorry, but the character of "Pavel" by Ted Raimi was not a comedic relief ... it was just a delay!) Believe me, we all got into this with a lot of desire to like it, but we feel incredibly disappointed and without two hours. <br /> <br /> If you loved this movie, plan to watch it several times, want to get married and have children with her, etc., that's fantastic. We all like what we like, so you do not have anything. judgment on my part But do not question the sense of humor or the loyalty of the fans of those who do not have multiple orgasms for the latest film coupe Campbell. This movie was a steaming sandwich in my humble opinion ... and as a true Campbell fan, I can say that!
