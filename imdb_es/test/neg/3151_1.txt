Barney and his friends are probably the worst children I've ever seen. He does not teach children anything, the songs are cheesy, it's not educational, and the characters are simply agitators. I do not disagree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people. This show does not contain any educational value or educational material appropriate for its age. More reasons why I do not like this show is due to the fucking plots, the cheesy dialogue, the horrible special effects and the abysmal story lines. Also, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. To say that it is a "model of what preschool television should be like," as the researchers of Yale Dorothy and Jerome Singer put it, is a lot of trash. They do not know what they are talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason why some children keep crying or become addicted to junk is because this show poisons the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / children) looking for a real preschool mother, switch to Nick Jr. and see "Why Super!" instead. It is much better than this turd and Five TV once had the nerve to put it in the "shake" but fortunately it was removed. I recommend everyone to stay as far as possible from this show. Parents, I recommend that you keep your children as far away as possible from this show. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Do not bother losing your valuable time with this stupid show. It's absolute garbage. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
