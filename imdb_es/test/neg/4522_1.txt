Get Smart should have the Get Stupid title. There is not a single funny line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad that it makes the Austin Powers movies look like Shakespearean. A few more movies like this and Steve Carell can say goodbye to his career. As for Anne Hathaway, what are you doing in this movie? She is a good actress, but she is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> The writing is pathetic. There is not a single funny, intelligent or witty line. There is not a single gag in sight. <br /> <br /> The address is terrible. Comedy is based on time. Someone should tell the director that. Every line that is supposed to be funny (and is not) is delivered with the worst sense of comic time I've seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
