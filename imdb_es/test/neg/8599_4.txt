Now I like Johnny Vegas, which is a good start, I also enjoy the mood of the toilet <br /> <br /> as those of Young Ones and Bottom, etc. However, this did not manage to bring a small smile to my face. The story follows Johnny after his wife expels him (how he got his good wife and son do not know) <br /> <br /> when he tries to fuck everything that moves . Failing normally. I expected this, but I found it totally boring and a waste <br /> <br /> of my time. Unless you're stuck with something to do for 90 minutes, apart from washing the car, do not bother ... <br /> <br />
