Ni√±as Mal is not a movie, it is a bad episode of a poorly conceived telenovela. <br /> <br /> The performance is not a little better than that in soap operas, I suppose the writer and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can not conceive anything remotely different. <br /> <br /> Disclaimer, return to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please. <br /> <br /> Stop wasting our time and money and giving a bad name to the respectable Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
