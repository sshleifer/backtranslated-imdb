The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script errors that only a non-critical viewer will simply avoid. The main question is: what is the murderer's purpose in his lie in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the murderer's goal is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and feel control over their fears and weaknesses. So why does he simply pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous improbability: can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing so as not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room? It does not make any sense at all, except to be the final effect (d) of the movie. The killer seems to always have control throughout the plot and if he is lying like a corpse, this may not be possible. Finally, it does not work. The right place for the murderer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the nurse), but not the floor of the white room. The director should not have shown the killer's face and perhaps the place where he is hiding. Then, the movie would be a good thriller. However, 'Saw' is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back.
