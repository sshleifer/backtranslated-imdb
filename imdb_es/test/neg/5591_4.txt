This is another one of those movies that I knew I would hate, but it ended up not being as bad as you might expect. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of T & A and even the DVD menu is full. Full of woman's breast. The first scenes of the film have a lot of sex and nudes, and I was beginning to think that there would be no story that exploited nudity to make money with a popular 8mm prequel. <br /> <br /> As I continued to watch, there was only more sex, nudes and main characters that I did not care about, but then the story started to develop and I started to see a point in everything, and it was a little better. <Br /> <br /> This is a man whose fiance is the daughter of an Ambasador and everyone has a promising future until photos of nudes of a sexual act of trois a trois appear and the blackmail is on the cards of the senders The man and his fianc√© must now get to the bottom of who sent the photos and how to shut them up. <br /> <br /> The movie in the first place has nothing to do with part 1, it does not even have anything that has to do with 8MM, it's a sex video, so I can see the similarities, however small they may be. <br /> <br /> The acting is neither good nor bad, there is simply no one who can interpret the parts that anyone can do. The production value of the movies is half of the way and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed going along the way to get to the bottom of the blackmailers' motives. I was anticipating answers, which is much more than I could say for the first time I consider trash. This movie also has some nice twists that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great, and it's a very slow start, but ultimately it's entertaining. I was not on the edge of my seat and I will not talk to my friends, this is something you should see, but if you watch many movies and always look for something new, this could entertain you for 90 minutes.
