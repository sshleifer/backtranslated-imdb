I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie left me cold. I expected another American In Paris from Minnelli, so maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> The movie did not have many songs and did not have impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by Kelly's very expressionistic dancing as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown, I'm sorry the song was so annoying. I also enjoyed Judy attacking Kelly with bric-a-brac. Check Lorna Luft's autobiography for interesting information about that scene. <br /> <br /> Actually, the film has what must be some of Cole Porter's most annoying songs, especially "Nina". In addition, Judy and Gene constantly scream like garish children. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin, which is parity of the course for musicals, but it is not saved with impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I suspect that the best parts of this film were left on the floor of the cutting room. Please, a movie restorer, find those movie fragments and show them what the movie could have been like!
