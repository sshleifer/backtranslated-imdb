Then, when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy in a hotel, Marion thinks it's his brother Brian, who got lost a long time ago, but when he gets close to him, he seems to be someone else with the same face. Marion manages to obtain her fingerprints and she takes it to the police and when the identity of her brother Brian is confirmed, she and Bob go to New York after finding out his whereabouts. They get in touch with Brian, but he still does not know what they're talking about, but the whole couple really wants to know where Brian has his 8-year-old son, maybe 9, Joey ... and even when they see Joey, he. He does not know them either. The plot is complicated and one day they find themselves thinking that they are also someone else. The experiments done on people just to make the killers perfect, however, the question of why they bother to put Bob and Marion in the same building is beyond me. Personally, Gregory Harrison played his two parts very well, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a bit of suspense, but that's it.
