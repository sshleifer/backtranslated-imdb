The film quickly arrives at a great chase scene with increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is that the kid who kidnapped Steven Seagal would have been hit by Seagal's driving, but that would probably have done away with the whole premise of the movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that they decided to do all kinds of changes in the plot of the movie, so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, this will reduce your chances of having a headache. <br /> <br /> It gives me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to return to the kind of characters he described in his most popular movies.
