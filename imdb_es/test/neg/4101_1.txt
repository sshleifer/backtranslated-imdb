What could have been a good story was destroyed by the ridiculous scenery of time travel. If something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something were introduced from the past into the present, it would have no effect in the past. <br /> <br /> I really want film producers to pass their ideas beyond a real scientist before finishing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time travel is possible, you have to stick to logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his superior performance. All the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could too. It was the writing that left them writhing in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the future" handled it better.
