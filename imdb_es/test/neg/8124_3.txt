I still remember when Frog Baseball was first broadcast on MTV. In some strange and surreal way, the caricature captured the stupid actions that I believe all children growing up in the United States get involved with. I shudder now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper with a magnifying glass, but at that time it was interesting for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s, we all knew "drug addicts." These were the children who wore Iron Maiden shirts to school, they grew their hair, they had immature mustaches and they were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had suspended one or two degrees. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when they were not drugged. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. As the GenXers like me reject the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a kind of strange postmodern anthem for us. Strange because, like Beavis & Co, we did not care if we had a hymn. It was just an internal joke that we all got right away, even if it was horrible.
