Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities of this bomb; The first difficulty facing the submarine "Vista al mar" is what appear to be pieces of rock? Falling through the water and crashing into his helmet. But it's not rock, it's under the North Pole, it's ICE! Everyone except the little children mentioned so far (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. <br /> <br /> Then, a disaster happens, that damn CELDA RADIATION CELL around the Earth catches fire! No one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is absolutely impossible for the radiation to "catch fire", and even if it could, there is NO AIR IN THE SPACE to burn. <br /> <br /> Literally, there is no good reason to overlook basic science concepts to second grade textbooks when a movie is made; However, Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again; maybe we should focus on the "people", which is quite easy, since they are CARDBOARD. <br /> <br /> The cast tries not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous game of sub-childhood children, much like later episodes of their TV series "Lost in Space", whose concept was erased directly from the writer Ib Melchior and then he hastened to production. <br /> <br /> However, the sub seems pretty good, so this one gets a "2".
