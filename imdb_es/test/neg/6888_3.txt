I reviewed this video hoping that I like it. Wanting you like it. I like foreign films, I like cinematography, I know that critics liked this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I do not care about "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. That's the best I can say about it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the looks are very significant, the actors are very sincere and it seems a very long movie. Although I fell asleep halfway, I woke up, rewound the tape and tried again. It was a test, but I got to the end. I did not like anything better for that.
