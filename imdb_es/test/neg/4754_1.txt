The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you must forgive it because it is very violent. No you should not. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but I have no idea how I can "spoil" this rotten movie. Even if you are a fan of Alien / Pred as I am waiting for the DVD. Nor is it worth a 3.99 rental, but you will be much less inclined to really hate this movie if you pay more than $ 12 per person plus purchases at the theater. <br /> <br /> At the Al AVPr in the theater, there were exactly two laughs, both from a girl sitting next to me. Apart from that there was total silence throughout. No ooohs, or "that was bad ass", nothing. Imagine being a patient on an operating table and simply receiving anesthesia. Now you know how you will feel in the theater after the AVPr opening scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this movie? Like War of the Worlds, MI 3 and other films driven by f / x, the director seems to be much more involved in what the people of CGI can think of than to develop characters or a plot. Spielberg has tried and failed in this several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Of course, movies make money but should they? The War of the Worlds and Minorities Report had the budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise and others, and the SS itself, but they were still horrible. I am sure that AVP wasted 90% of its budget in GC and had no choice but to hire an actor who said yes, although the delivery agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and selecting actors at random. <br /> <br /> There is no tension developed in any scene, so we are never close to surprising ourselves. Who cares who dies? We did not know any of them, we all know what happens when the little extraterrestrials make their corporal exit, we all know that the blood is acidic. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even AVP, the directors make use of the fact that the Aliens can think, they can hide and they can set traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop characters that you really want to see live or get killed. In this installment you will never mind who lives or dies, not a child, a father, a pregnant woman. The characters have only one purpose in this movie, to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the film will be a predictable joke. The character development scenes mix clich√©s, bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point that we really do not care if they kill them as long as they die in ways never before seen. But they do not. The director tried to do something different from those that preceded him in the Alien franchise, but he only managed to discard the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and steal the rest of other recent science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> There is no original use of the Alien or Pred characters. Actually, Pred has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen, although the last movie made us believe that Pred worshiped aliens as such a deadly enemy that they used the murder of one like Rite of Passage. The AlienPred never really develops as a fearsome creature. Its ability to inject parasites in a host is extracted from several more recent films. Probably, Hellboy, where Samiel's dismembered tongue, injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they nailed a victim's throat. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, we have no reason to worry about anything in this movie. There is violence, but it is not surprising or surprising, and it is nothing that has not been seen in any of the one hundred films of Slasher. The CG is fine and both alien species are designed to look and move as they have in past movies. But since the characters never develop and the acting is so bad, we expect everyone to die. The girl was probably the best actor in the group, but, unfortunately, we do not care if the children, the women or any other person lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. Eventually, but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuclear target, Gunnison's way of eliminating the "infection". And not before, another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for more sequels, is not it? In a film full of bad scenes, the worst could have been saved for the end. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything is worth repeating: bad script, no plot, not original action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal action, decent action F / x that were wasted due to the many defects. <br /> <br /> I do not mind going to an independent movie and being disappointed. The actors, the directors and the team are probably starting their careers and working with a reduced budget. For a movie with this kind of budget and exaggeration, I feel cheated and disappointed. This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the initial scene to the final credits. It's sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 did not even look so good.
