I do not know what happened to the director Abel Ferrara. Since the new version of "Body Snatchers", it seems that he has lost it. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the 90s: accusations of a decade have gone wrong. With films like "'R Xmas' (whatever that means) and" New Rose Hotel "he seems determined to upset and bore his former supporters. This movie has no life in it. While he gets excellent performances from his actors in all his projects, the result of this mix of ideas simply does not fit. Whatever the point, it is that the new generation of drug dealers is pretty much the same as any other upper middle class, New Yawkuh, gets lost in the script of the drowsy mind and in the boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at the 4-Plex in downtown Los Angeles. In the lobby, while buying tickets, I was surprised and loved to see him filled with a large group of men and women of mixed race. his twenty and thirty years. Then they started to enter the theater, but it was the theater that presented "8 Mile" not "R Xmas"! The theater that showed "'R Xmas' (keep in mind that it was the opening night!) There were a total of 4 people looking at it, me, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Very good, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
