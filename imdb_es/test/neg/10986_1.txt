This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show that I saw in Las Vegas six years ago, without athletics. By that I mean some striking and artistic images that appear randomly, without any supporting frame. The fake sepia-colored film is really sticky. This device is almost never justified and is certainly not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can cheat some of the people sometimes.
