Once again, Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any other inspiration other than recycling. Here we have a simulated documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about a low life ( Deconstructing Harry) who believes that being a genius exempts him from being an imbecile (ditto). Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow; Yes, he was a jerk, but I'm a genius, so you have to love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has only produced two good films in the last ten years; the fine but overloaded bullets on Broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), nervous but experimental (Husbands and wives), to drek (Alice, Scenes from a mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrities, Deconstructing Harry). His films do not even try to have a narrative arc anymore, and his humor seems to be very funny, not funny. After Deconstructing Harry, I stopped watching his movies in theaters; After Sweet and Lowdown I can also stop renting them.
