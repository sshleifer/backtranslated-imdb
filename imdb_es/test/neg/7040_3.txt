Two escaped convicts come out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. That's the first scene, and it made me shudder, fearing what was in the store. But at the end of the first half hour, everyone was caught in the torrent of images. Not because I cared about any of the characters, but because I was horrified by how execrable the movie was and I was curious to see how low it could fall. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are former inmates. After murdering the two innocent campers, they plow through the forest and head to the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and homosexual Behr. At first, the fugitives pretend that their car has broken down and they need to use the phone, but gradually reveal their identities. <br /> <br /> Well, so far it looks like family territory. "Desperate hours" or "Funny games" maybe. But, wait, the gay son is in connivance with the two. It seems that Stockwell, upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy and threw him out. Billy died and Behr now blames his dad for the death. And, in fact, Dad is something of a Neanderthal in regards to paraphilias, the fact that he was found cohabiting with a secretary in spite of it. <br /> <br /> The afflicted Behr simply searched and searched, looking for someone else who had known Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It turned out to be one of the fugitives, and now Behr is determined to guarantee his freedom. <br /> <br /> After that, everything gets distorted. The people talk. They talk and talk. They talk continuously. And NOT about the two crazy killers who simply can not wait to put one between their eyes. No, the dialogue says something like: "You were so scared of something inside you that you even scared away your own SON". That's Behr, the young gay, talking to Stockwell. It's as if a domestic drama of the evening had mixed their genes with a murderous thriller in some kind of transforming device or shaker. <br /> <br /> James Remar offers the only real acting as the most talkative and sinister of the two fugitives. And that's mainly due to his rough but fluid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's, and his lips wide as guppy. It is easy for eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell has had a decent performance, including his invaluable bizarre turn in "Blue Velvet", in which he was my support player, but here laziness, the advancement of the years, or the direction loose has shaped every movement and every expression in a stereotype. It is as if you read the instructions of the stage ("Look surprised" and "Scream furiously") and follow them literally. There is not a surprise in a cart. <br /> <br /> If the gay son, Jason Behr, ever blinked, it must have been while he was blinking at the same time because I missed him. It has a long neck and only one expression on its instrument. Woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the wood of pine knot panels. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope you have not given up your daily work. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the functional staging without being at all innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I lost track of where everyone was supposed to be, since the killers are circling on the cabin porch and the family has locked themselves inside with a shotgun. I also could not understand how Stockwell could shoot through the cockpit door, hit Remar and knock him down on the porch again, and then Remar could just get up, shake off the dust and make an irritable reaction like, "Okay. play that game. " But why continue? See it if you have to.
