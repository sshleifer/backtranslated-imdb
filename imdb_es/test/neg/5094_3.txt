A good example of reverse and politically correct racism where white men present themselves as meaningless brutes who are only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior both in appearance and abilities. In addition to making the story too boring, this also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with one side or the other, it is simply too simplifying. The repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as is the voice-over), the characters lack depth and the viewer is quickly lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that supposed to mean". However, the photography is wonderful, and in general there is a lot of atmosphere, but the beautiful shots of misty landscapes do not save this film. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye appeal. In fact, his character could have been played by anyone else, since he's basically an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters), and disappears anyway in the middle of the movie. But if you're anxious to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie ...
