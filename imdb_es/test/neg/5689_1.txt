Well, please, believe me when I say that this is a terrible, terrible science fiction movie. It is done so badly that much of the film is presented as an involuntary surrealism and is absolutely a waste of 100% time. Horrible, but somehow also deeply without grace. I saw this as a double feature with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, that does not say much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so convoluted that it is impossible to follow it. The narrative is cryptic, often meaningless, seemingly endless and exhaustingly exhausting. Literally, half of the film is duplicated scenes of the female protagonist, who looks like Brian Bosworth, walking through the desert. The movie actually starts pretty well, but then it plummets into Pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. Absolutely horrible and truly a test of absurdist resistance. Zero stars. --- | --- Reviews by Flak Magnet
