With all the exaggeration surrounding the stars of the film, this movie left me wanting. I expected a much better film considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy, De Niro and Russo, but I discovered that the film had collapsed. The comedy sequences were exaggerated and the superior performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save it! <br /> <br /> ** of *****
