I was seeing the beginning of this on a Friday, at noon, while working on the computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, cleaning some files and answering some communications. I was interrupted a couple of times, so I had trouble clarifying all the details (although it is not a job of proportions of Hitchcock, where missing a detail can be discarded), and was not exactly a piece "fascinating" work . <br /> <br /> Then, during a commercial, read the only previous comment here (for "mgconlan-1"), and you can agree with its details. <br /> <br /> It is not enough in the category of such a horrible movie that it is fascinatingly "good", but I would like to record it on the tape when it is played again (instead of watching it as it is broadcast), so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts I missed this first time. <br /> <br /> Give it a "3 *" for the attractiveness of the four main characters.
