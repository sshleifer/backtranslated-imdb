Vampires skating on wheels? I'm sorry, but even for the 80s that's too cheesy to be remotely scary ... You can excuse the original kitsch moment because it parodies old movies and TV shows, but that was done once, so the sequel is necessary! Be a little less camp, or more extravagant! In addition, the first film was attended by Chris Sarandon, a man who could even make stalking clubs in casual knitwear look seductive! - that this is missing a lot, so there was no 'danger' in anything that happened, it just seemed silly. <br /> <br /> It's true that I only saw him once when he was 7 years old, but by then he was already a great fan of the original. I remember being upset. For me, there is not a sequel to Fright Night, just a parody of bad taste that does not deserve any rating at all.
