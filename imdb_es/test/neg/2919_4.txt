While this is not a classic comedy of all time, it is a very good movie to see if you watch it on a rainy Saturday morning and there are not many other things at that time. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American who returns home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He has come home from China to look for an American wife and plans to return to China to continue with his father's work. its corrupt hometown when the existing political machine that controls the city realizes that it would be a perfect person to compete against the current mayor, who is also the head of the city's underworld. They imagine that the clumsy and wobbly Cobb has no chance to win and therefore, the current mayor continues to run the city and execute his plans, which makes them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd is not doing physical comedy here as he did in his silent films. He makes a convincing portrait of Cobb with reserved discreet dignity. The acting was good of everyone involved and the story and the script were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> Made in 1934, the film has a pretty racist language when it speaks of the Chinese and also has a typical black character that was, but these stereotypes are not as bad as those I've seen in other movies of that time. <br /> <br /> Although it's not close to being Lloyd's best movie, this film entertains and Lloyd is very good as Cobb. You will not be impressed by this movie, but it may be enough to increase your interest in Lloyd and make you want to see more of his work.
