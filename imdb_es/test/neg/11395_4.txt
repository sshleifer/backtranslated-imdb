After watching this movie, I thought to myself, it really clarified the life of Errol Flynn! The movie is really very beautiful. They really achieved the Hollywood atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s to perfection. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and elegant. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious movie about the life of Errol Flynn? Nah! It's a funny movie based on all the scandalous things he did in his life. <br /> <br /> Why do I criticize this movie? This is a movie that had many promises but could not deliver. Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn. He was not as handsome as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously, but was a man who, although gifted with great talent, was somewhat disturbed and unhappy inside . Flynn's love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his life. He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene in the film showed Errol begging Olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away. He appears in his suit, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool while pouring his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the movie, but it's a bit fitting because everyone already knows how he finally broke away from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This movie could have had much more depth, could I have been better written. Sure they showed all the scandals, but they never showed the human center of Errol Flynn. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn even though the writing of the film did not do it in depth. <br /> <br /> I will probably never see this movie again, but I can still remember after seeing this movie, "Wow, this could have been much more ...!" I give this movie a D +.
