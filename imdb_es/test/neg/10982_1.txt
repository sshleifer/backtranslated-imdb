It is awful. <br /> <br /> A pretty short review, I know, but it's been a long time since a movie left me in such a bewildered state, wondering how the hell a movie like that is made. <Br /> <br /> The last time it happened was the 'Mission to Mars' last year in Turkey. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is an ex-con who tries to improve himself through self-help videos, endless seminars and improvement courses. . Live by the phrases that are exposed in these courses. <br /> <br /> He meets a washed-out nightclub singer, played by Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; His new career will be that of a talent agent, with the singer as his only client. <br /> <br /> Funded by his gospel singer, his paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler, moves into the store and tries to relaunch Nikki's career, with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> 'Walk the Talk' is the reason why Australians are so contemptuous of Australian cinema. It is poorly built, lame and too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should have barely touched the 80 minute mark). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and is very repetitive. The audience is not given a character to empathize with; a vital ingredient in a movie like this, supposedly about a 'loser' who tries it. <br /> <br /> The sad and frankly poor ending comes at the end of the 30 minutes of the most stunned dialogue and the scenes that have Crying for an electrical fault. <br /> <br /> This film is a flaw at all levels: worsened for the Queensland public by its liberal and uncertain use of several Gold Coast / Palm Beach locations; and its ridiculous use of the names of the suburbs of Brisbane like Norman Park and Caboolture.
