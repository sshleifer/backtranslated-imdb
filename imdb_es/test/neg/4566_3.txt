I think this is a movie for "alternative reality" teenagers ... More precisely, a Ferris Bueller type character as the leader of a trap ring. Yes, I know it is not meant to compare it with Ferris Bueller, at least not in a way "from oranges to oranges", but it will not be like that. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: they are far from being even a minor classic. It is visible, but only if you are not expecting much. That said, the main character has some charm, but the premise is exhausted because the writing is not intelligent. The movie simply did not produce enough laughter, twists or tensions to keep my interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept watching ... Watching in the hope of seeing if something suddenly clicked. He did not. So, however elegant it is, I would not recommend this movie. By the way, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as the director. She is really bad, I hope the payment check was excessively large.
