Then, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo for the second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original by a group of unpleasant ecologists and anti-capitalists. And add a Cobra. Most of the film is devoted to listening to the fair characters who talk about the evil capitalist pigs, while among this cavalcade of condescension are memories of what happened on the island before they arrived. DNA experiments were performed, bugs began to grow, people spoke to each other as if they were morally superior madmen, etc. It goes without saying that it would have been a much better movie if they had made the flashbacks of the film and had forgotten. The holy benefactors. So do not forget, there are some brief scenes scattered here and there, where the most sacred gang that you are chosen one by one, but probably represent less than 2% of the film. The main event that faces our main characters lasts about a minute and is as exciting as watching the latest advances of the Dino-Crisis videogame. <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is pretty bad, even for this guy from the movie. Half of the actors seem to be more concerned with uttering every last syllable of each word than talking about their dialogue in a credible way. <br /> <br /> I actually made it to the end, but it's one. of those movies I would like to have recorded them and then see them later, because there are many parts that need to be sent quickly. In general, I give this effort a star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B movie fun to watch. It's a sad day when you can honestly say that the creators of this movie could have learned one or two things by watching Boa Vs. Python
