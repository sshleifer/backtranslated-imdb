As others mentioned, could there be any other reason to watch this movie other than to see the former "Wayne's World" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was a good panning shot of Ireland, it would give him another reason to see it. But, instead, it focuses on a normal little town that is obviously surrounded by the "green pastures" of the Emerald Isle that are often shown in Irish films. If there were any cultural 'spice' to admire the 'Irish personality', it would be worth seeing, however, this could almost have been filmed in England. Pity for Myers, but this fails to please or satisfy the heart of anyone who has wanted to visit the land of Guinness.
