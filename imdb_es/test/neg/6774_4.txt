Fortunately, brief mystery about a telephony operator that is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad magnate. The discovery provokes an attempt on his life that is frustrated by Charlie Ruggles as a "deflector of the crime". Things change for the dangerous when they all end up in the location of the title and another attempt is made in the girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your tolerance for Rugggles and their nonsense. Normally, I like Ruggles, but there was something in this paper that rubbed me the wrong way. In fact, I think it did not help that the mystery was not very good, so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you looking. Yes, the ending on the train was exciting but it did not make up for everything that happened before. It is not worth looking for, but if you find it, try it.
