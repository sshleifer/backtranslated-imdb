Steven Seagal has made a really boring, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!! ???! This movie has some action scenes, but they are misdirected and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of American Nazis spread a lethal virus, which is capable of killing the state of Montana. Wesley (the character of Seagal) desperately tries to find a cure, and that's the story of The Patriot. The Patriot is an extremely boring movie, because nothing happens. It is full of boring dialogues and illogical gaps between stupid events and actors. Steven Seagal has fully climbed # Â¤d in this movie, and I would not recommend this laugh to my worst enemy. 3/10
