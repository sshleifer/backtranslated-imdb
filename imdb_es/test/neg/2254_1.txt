Seriously disappointing the performance of Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and scant, and, unless it is tried indirectly, this film actually glorifies the Nazis and presents them as men of honor, and shows that the people Jew is cheating, can not fulfill the bloody vicious promises. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler, along with the most famous Nazis, attend a stupid argument about the death of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris is incredibly ridiculous. The Nazis laugh and crush every death in the movie as if they were watching a STUPID basketball game, the deal at the end is scarce. what is really atrocious is that the film received excellent reviews and is classified here in the 40s among the 250 best films. You will not be surprised if you reap many awards, including Oscars, too. The movie is just a kiss for the Jewish people, but reconsider, you're not even doing a great job doing that. it really dwarfed the whole Nazi-Jewish conflict and a pure insult to all those who fought and suffered the tyranny of the Nazis.
