This is my first comment about a movie here. I have to say that of all the bad movies I've seen, like Braindead, for example, this is really WORST! I promise. Do not even look at it. It's boring, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is a great piece of shit! If I could give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest one is 1, which is horrible, I have to vote that. But I would say that the movie is worse than horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this movie and expect it to improve, because I can tell you that I will not. I expected a single scene to come that was worth seeing. No good scene came at all. <br /> <br /> What an excellent piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> And Coolio as a vampire? Haha LMAO! YARGH!
