Definitely not your typical Polizia, Redneck never worked for me. The film tells the story of a jewelry theft that went wrong and a child who was inadvertently kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to escape, the thieves leave behind a bloody trail of death as they plot a plan to rescue the child. The plan is never carried out, since the thieves have more intention of reaching France and the child intends to stay with them. While I could cite a series of problems I had with the film, will I focus on the most obvious? The character of Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work on The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films like Crime Boss to his most remembered role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I've always thought of him as a super cool client. Unfortunately, Savalas can hardly be seen in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and tell her to act as psychotic as possible? It might not have been so bad if his actions had been performed in the context of a plot that mattered to me, but here he seems to be acting strangely for the simple fact of being strange. It seems to be random madness. And what about that accent? Savalas could have been a lot of things, but Southern is not one of them. It sounds completely ridiculous even trying the accent. Beyond that, I found little interest in the rest of the movie. As I indicated, the plot never appealed to me. I just did not care what was happening. And the notion that the child feels so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle does not seem to be true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the generally reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "names" of actors and there is not a good performance among them. To make matters worse, I think the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing but the brightness of his watch to illuminate the shots. I could not say what was happening. Characters that I hate, a plot that I do not care about, and production values ​​that failed. No wonder I gave Redneck a 3/10.
