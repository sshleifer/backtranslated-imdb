When I discovered that there was a Christmas vacation 2, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and saw it as soon as it arrived through the mailbox. I love all the national lampoons movies with Chevy, and I bet he was glad he was not in it. I could not believe how bad this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national film of lampoons, but believe me it is! . This movie probably looked like a good idea on paper, since cousin Eddie was the main character, he started to fret me from the beginning of the movie, and it became totally untimely in the middle of the movie and at the end of the movie . My brain had died and I could not remember what had happened! .
