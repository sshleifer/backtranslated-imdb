It must be said something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular currently selected. <br /> <br /> The 'square' is populated by a group of characters so miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, spiteful and implacably unthinkable as you can imagine. Everyone is stabbing someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to cheat someone. That, or they are being stabbed, gored or cheated. Nobody is happy No one laughs No one has a dazzling stroke of luck or a really nice day. It's hell, with cockney accents. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this program should be sponsored by The Samaritans. It is perfect for the depressed. It does not encourage them; What it does do is present a whole community of people so sad and discouraged that viewers are moved to believe that their luck could really be worse, that they could be living in 'Albert Square'. <br /> <br /> Apart from the above; as a representation of the East End of London, it is pure Hokum. The creators of programs have evidently never been to the other side of the city. The first thing you find on Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this pretty well defines the racial majority of the population. The British British white are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. A large advertisement currently near the Bow Road overpass, sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, says that "Eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor more quickly." Ten healthy and smiling faces look at the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark skinned ... <br /> <br /> What's more, I used to work with a group of Anglo-Saxons, I dare to say "pukka", cockneys a few years ago. And I can tell you that a more odiously racist experience than I've ever had. Every day was like a rally by Oswald Moseley. They could not spend 5 minutes without denigrating any other race or nationality than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' Fackin 'Maceroons' were the small change of conversation. In fact, its complete (and extremely limited) set of adjectives fixed on the sexual organs and their application. Alf Garnett was a comparison of liberal virtues in comparison. <br /> <br /> Any program that purported to represent Native Caucasians from East London in its true nature would be completely unsuitable for transmission, even after the 9 o'clock basin. . Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you would be somewhere near the brand. But when they were not being inveterate fans, at least they were extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I do not know how such a telenovela was formed. This imaginary island shipwrecked with white misery has absolutely nothing to do with true culture. And if you have a relatively optimistic disposition, you will quickly reduce it to tears of pain. Comparatively ordinary actors who claim to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressive with cockney accents, what is the point of that? <br /> <br /> Bored, sad, relentlessly disillusioned and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of a nation apparently sick and dying. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague.
