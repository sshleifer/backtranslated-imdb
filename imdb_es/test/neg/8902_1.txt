The endless repetition about the evil World Bank, the IMF, globalization and the Americans are blamed for all the problems in Africa and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. In fact, the French occupied Mali, the country where the film is developed, for centuries, but they are just bad peripheral children. <br /> <br /> You do not learn enough about any of the characters to really worry about what is happening. They are completely marginal in preaching, which goes on and on and on. There is no plot, no character development, no humor (except for a few hits in Bush and Wolfowitz, but that is almost a trap, it is very easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre: there is no redemption there. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a film could spend two hours preaching on such a big topic and transmitting real information totally zero. The Irish ballad "I was dying and then the hunger came" has more content. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real content on the subject of Film, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this one.
