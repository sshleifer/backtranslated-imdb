After an astronaut dies in space, he is taken back to a military base. Inside the man they discover alien embryos, he is the host of what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of the Giant Leeches" (see separate review) but may be best known for his work on "Columbo". The executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one ... particularly in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This film is corny and poorly constructed. What is interesting are the bad effects, not the film itself. A scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and is an embarrassing cartoon representation. Even for 1958. And then, when an adult extraterrestrial appears ... you'll wonder why he's wearing shoes. Or if you're really perceptive, you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies. <br /> <br /> In no way is this the worst science fiction movie you'll ever see. And you almost have to give it some credit: the alien host that surpasses an idea of ​​military base is prior to "The Thing" and "Alien" for several years. I do not know if these films were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. Beyond that, however, the film fails and is only ideal for making jokes when you drink. I have not seen the version of "Mystery Science Theater", but this is a film worthy of its insults.
