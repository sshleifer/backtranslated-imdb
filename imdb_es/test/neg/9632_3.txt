I've seen this movie several times and I've never liked it. I'm not a fan called "nu horror", so I can not be fired for that. I found it a bit sordid, I think what bothers me about Hammers is the aspect of sexploitation, you do not care about sex, but sexploitation. I'm surprised how many people have rated this movie so high, so I'll take another look. But to me, it was not creepy, it had no atmosphere, just a little "omigod, look at those malicious and evil prostitutes and that innocent little Anna about to be raped by another nasty man, oh!" I suppose that, ultimately, for me, the film had no depth at all, just a group of cunning and unpleasant men and women just for the value of excitement. This, to be sure, was to some extent what Victorian England was, but even sets are too clumsy and boring, which gives a sense of the Victorian threat. The horrors of Roger Corman on the other hand, now that's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me, this was just an exploitative garbage, with flat feet.
