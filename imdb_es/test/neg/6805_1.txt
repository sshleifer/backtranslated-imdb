For anyone who wants to know something about the real Diane Arbus, or who values ​​psychological truth, this movie is abysmal. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and troubled person, but this film describes her as a person completely involved and truly strange in her taste and judgment. Kidman presents her as vain and vague, while she was someone who struck people with her charisma. The totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is pretty incredible, and Robert Downey is really upset in his portrait of someone who seems to think he is superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. The film describes this encounter as the source of Arbus's interest in the "monsters", which is a truly banal explanation of the inspiration behind some of the best photographs of the 20th century. The mystery for me is why people of some talent and intelligence decided to get involved with this movie in some way.
