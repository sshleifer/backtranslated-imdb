This movie seems as if someone had a nice idea for a movie, thought of two or three fun possibilities, hired a good cast and then gave it all to a really bad scriptwriter and even a worse director. The director filmed a romantic comedy as if it were a dark and artistic film: strange camera angles, shots with blue filter, prolonged glances and close to the raindrops. Steve Zahn was fine, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; It was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock fought valiantly with a character who was supposed to be crazy, but whose insanity consisted of things like kissing madly a husband she hated, abandoning her son, going to carnival rides, offering money without money, and ruining a ride with a passenger plane mate. The script had very few funny lines; There was no physical comedy; it was boring. He introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them before they could develop. To make matters worse, the "turn" in the end was a slap in the face to anyone waiting for a fun romantic comedy. If you saw the trailer of the movie and you liked it, as I did, my advice is: do not go to see the movie. It will only spoil a good trailer.
