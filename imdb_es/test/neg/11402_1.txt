One of the movies that I simply DO NOT WANT to see. I got it in the preview, but damn it, the performance was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still surprised to have seen the whole movie ...) I wondered why I saw it. <br /> <br /> Also here in the Netherlands, the author of this film (it is filmed from a Giphart book he thought was very bad, and he was disappointed that his film came out that way. role in choosing people for the cast.
