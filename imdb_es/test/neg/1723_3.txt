Not only that the cover of VHS and DVD (at least in Europe) shows a scene that has nothing to do with the real plot of the film, the performance is so bad, that the film is clamoring for mocking. If you have nothing to do, you're with some good friends and you want to laugh at a movie, which is supposed to be serious, look at Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who will teach you how to bring down the bad guys with empty cardboard boxes! Pity Dennis Hopper, following the example of Travoltas starring in his own "battlefield land." For those who want to see a good movie about the destruction of the earth by a terrible force, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and watch "Armageddon" for the twentieth time!
