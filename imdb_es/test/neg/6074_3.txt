This movie is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is horrible. How could you choose an actor built as Rambo to play the "Maestro"? It shows no credibility at all and surpasses Beethoven. Above all, long hairs do not look good on your head. The main actress lacks all the necessary subtleties for her character. The camera shots are corny and too conventional. The lights close off the feelings of the characters. Bad launches and cheap direction. Too! The only worthwhile scene for the movie is when Beeth (I hope you do not mind me calling him by his nickname) is turning the girl's song into a joke. Anyway, I hope Harris can find his way back to the real movie where he can really show off his hairless talent.
