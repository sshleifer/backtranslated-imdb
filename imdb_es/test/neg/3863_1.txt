Film Noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, intelligence, intellect and images. This movie does not have any of that, although they really tried hard with the images. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie in which your cousin Marky, the garbage truck driver, is always talking about how he's going to succeed. The movies someday, they would do. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The images, although they are obviously expensive to make, are the work of a director who has tried to be intelligent and failed miserably due to a serious lack of brain capacity. The performance varied from sub-par to simply bad. The story could have been retrieved by a true writer and director, but I suspect those people would not have touched it with a barge stick. <br /> <br /> Approximately 1/4 of the way, I noticed striking similarities to the scene in Sim0ne where Viktor, desperate to get rid of his actress, makes the worst movie in the world. I thought I would check IMDb to see if there had been a similar effect in this movie, and to my surprise, yes. I would almost feel tempted to give 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed to pretentious groupies, but I will not. It's so bad
