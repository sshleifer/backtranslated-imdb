A forgettable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie, but Rob Estes plays a cunning cop who is Nostradamus for some reason and who fights against medieval monks who travel in time and run with weapons and weapons . Fire to start the apocalypse. Oh, yes, there's also a sexy FBI agent who turns out to be a psychic and is trying to get Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad they could not predict a better plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
