I had never seen a movie that bothered me so much. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say that the plot is horrible. I did not have the patience to see it, so I only saw half, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Simply terribly annoying. This movie has to do with a silly guy who tries to connect with the tyrant daughter of his boss. When he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go home that night to see his father's owl, and he believes that she had invited him to go with her to a party and be at her house at 6 pm . He is very disappointed to discover that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. After his father left home and left precise orders, about caring for the house and his beloved bird, a secretary appears, a renegade son and all kinds of fun things that do NOT happen in the house. But finally he hooks up with his boss's daughter. CONFIDEME THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
