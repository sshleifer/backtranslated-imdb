First, few universities allow students to take courses from their parents' lover. Second, few teachers are sleeping with bedroom cooks. Third, few Latino coeds have a dad who cooks in his bedroom. Fourth, once a SECOND member of a project team of a small university group encounters a violent disappearance, the PRESIDENT of the university will dissolve the entire class and will NOT turn a blind eye while the professor cheerfully directs the rest of the group towards frightful deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT do not make any sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this film really stinks.
