I usually enjoy underground and anti-hero movies, but it's a bad joke. I wonder how this can be called a movie. All these people are lost and the filmmaker does not make them interesting at all. They are not funny, they are not tragic, just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something, but I will not see it again to find out what. Anyone with a camcorder can do better than that ... <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 for the originality. Everything else is garbage.
