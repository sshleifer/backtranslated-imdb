This is a little less disgusting than the first two films, but otherwise it is a usual matter: a slice of sick, sordid and unbalanced cinema. Charles Bronson is back, in action when his friend is killed by neighborhood terrorists. You see, crime has increased 11% in the South Belmont area ... what can be done? A stronger police presence? Harder jails? Harder sentences? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson's to get a bloodthirsty revenge. or, as the writers would say, justice: this time it is the police killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The writers do the impossible to turn Kersey into the hero, sending useless cops to the area. just to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it to protect it, and provide a scene in which Kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief in the back, to applaud the crowd watching him. Penalty capital for theft? Well OK. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest misrepresentation of the characters in numbers that exist only to encourage Kersey or to back him up is appalling. <br /> <br /> Sure, these villains are scum, but should not the film leave the audience to make a decision, instead of tilting the whole thing towards Kersey and his mindless response? Interestingly, the beleaguered residents do not fear gang retaliation or blame Kersey for the violence, which is strange since a character is murdered precisely because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, everyone pulls weapons out of their sock drawers and joins happily with the massacre, never stopping to think about things or struggle with the idea of ​​having to kill another human being. <br /> <br /> Atrociously shallow performances do not help? Bronson literally has a facial expression at all times and can not even put the inflection in the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here? a machine gun? A rocket launcher? ?? and new minimums of misogyny: the film aims to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or throat cutting; and prepares them in a very stupid way, as a victim who ventures into the gang-controlled neighborhood, ravaged by crime, to invite a stranger or another who goes shopping only at night. This is garbage, pure and simple, meaningless garbage put together without style or meaning.
