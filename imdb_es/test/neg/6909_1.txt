My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after listening on the radio that it was a good movie that is worth seeing, even with "Cars". Within the first ten minutes of the movie, I was horrified. To begin with, the cows, which should be females, had male voices. Then I realized that they're really supposed to be guys. I put aside the transvestite cows for a moment and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was so corny that I could not help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, although not predictable, but it took a long time to reach its point. I was having trouble sitting down, and I'm 19 years old. The children in the theater actually got up and ran through the hallways. I wanted to join them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with references about alcohol consumption, not to mention that the cows / bulls actually connected and stole a car, then drank and drove, burst into a child's house to push it away. the bed (although he deserved it), then he escaped from the cops, whom the writers of the film made them look like terrible people. This is not the kind of thing I would like my children to be exposed to. Too much of that in the real world, if I wanted my son to see the guys drinking and driving and directing the police in a chase, he would put them in front of the 10 o'clock news. Movies for children are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape from ridicule. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast about? That's why the old Disney movies, such as Beauty and the Beast, The Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid, etc. They are classic. If you want your children to see a great caricature with basically the same plot as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King". You can get a great story without the horrible references to drinks and driving, and car theft. The writers of "Barnyard" obviously tried to continue the great tendency to make a film for children that parents could also enjoy, but they did it with very bad taste. I would never take my children to see this, and I suggest you save your money and look at something else.
