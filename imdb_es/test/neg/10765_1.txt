This is, by far, the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel that has never been devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I felt genuinely offended by what they did with the characters, but this atrocity is not worth it, even if you're not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakeney, for example I would never stab people in the back just to go down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a chain of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever she is. Chauvelin would not shoot Tony randomly in the head. The name of Chauvelin is not, nor has it ever been, Paul. They have completely eradicated any reference to Pimpernel costumes, replacing them with gadgets and contraptions of James Bond. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself ... The makeup is horrible. Women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty brand wanders around her face at random. The poor and pitiful actors do not have a script to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as a wet tissue. The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And whoever is responsible for all those little legends at the bottom of the screen must be forced to see this movie as a penance. (I counted 13 location legends in the first half hour before I gave up, as if we could not understand that the body of water between England and France is the English Channel). <br /> <br /> The movie - if I dare call it that, since it's really just a video tape with a filter - is absolutely no redeeming value. Do not waste your time and your brain cells in this rancid turn; instead, go see the Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour version of 1982, or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or ANYTHING, but this one.
