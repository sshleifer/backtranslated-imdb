The movie starts with a lot of voiceover, a bad sign. Then he simply slides downhill with silly and insulting intelligence scenes involving trappers and Indians. But, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the happy mountain men dance together in a high alpine meadow. Meanwhile, the carefree Indians sit down to watch them. It's a better scene than the cowboys dancing in "Blazing Saddles." There is a small flaw in this comparison; "Across the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
