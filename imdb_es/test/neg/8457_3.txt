"Terror in the Aisles" may seem like the ultimate treatment for horror fans, but, in fact, it has very few to offer. Of course, it presents a decent and versatile selection (too versatile?) Of horror / suspense fragments that are considered classic but ... what's the point? This documentary aims mainly at the horror-loving public, so we've already seen all these clips, right? The only thing really worthy of praise about this project is the edition. If you like queens, the persecutions of vile murderers and that kind of thing, "Terror in the Aisles" has some compilations of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes come together in a lame wraparound story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater. Between two sequences, the direction of the viewer and "explain" why we love the horror so much. These speeches, naturally, are soporific and quite obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ... blah blah blah) and I do not understand why many people love the concept. It's worth checking it out if you're a loyal fan of horror, but it's certainly not an essential vision. On the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, be careful that the parts of it here do not ruin your future vision. The main reason why I did not like it in general is that it blatantly ignores many lesser-known, but fundamental (foreign) titles that focus infinitely on "Halloween." However, this results in a great interior joke, when Donald Pleasance shouts at the screen to his own character.
