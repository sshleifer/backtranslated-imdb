Nishabd means without words. This must be the condition of the script before the filming of this film begins and, therefore, throughout this film it is claimed for content. What you're looking for is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get are very common, very common events that do not excite or surprise you. Then, what remains is finally the picturesque locations of Kerala brilliantly filmed by cinematographer Amit Roy and the camera-friendly histrionics of the newly discovered Jiah Khan. This does not hide for lack of a specific script. Producer and director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good track record of movies, needs to pull up his socks. As far as Mr. Bachchan is concerned, I do not want to talk about him in the context of this film. <br /> <br /> While I review it, I feel a loss of words. I'm speechless, rather without words. <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: this movie can be compared to an equally bad movie released some time ago called BLACK. I do not see the difference between the histrionics of the main characters in both movies. What did you just say? That was a world class cinema, blah, blah, and I have no taste. Well, take a walk. No, I do not mean literally, but real to the theaters that show this movie. Because in that case you could find this movie an Oscar-level material.
