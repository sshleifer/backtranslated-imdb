Doug McClure has starred in some of these genre adventures produced by the British, and this has to be the worst of all. I know that THE LAND THE TIME FORGOT has its critics, but at least that movie included filming on the spot and relatively good production values. That's the problem with this film: the production values ​​go far beyond the territory "so bad that they are good" and they become "so bad that I think I'll go see what's on the other channels" <br /> <br /> An example of this is the first scene in which the intrepid Cushing and McClure meet a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is a medium-sized man disguised as a rubber monster to look more than twenty feet in height through a projection on the back above blown. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running in place. Did I mention that this is one of the most convincing pieces? Actually, it does not seem to have been filmed in someone's living room with the change of leftover WHO budget from that year's DOC. Even the old DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is insipid and what should have been a funny line "You can not hypnotize me, I'm British" is delivered very flat (Cushing speaks a very similar line in HORROR EXPRESS) in A script without characterization, plot and memorable dialogue. It is not only the fact that the dialogue is not memorable, but it is also rare and rare since the monsters do not speak. Would not it have been better to have the main evil humanoid men as in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so they could explain the plot? Does anyone here know what the plot really is? <br /> <br /> A very tedious British film that even the twin talents of Caroline Munro can not save. The whole mood of the film is summed up in the final sequence with two key cops
