Despite the star cast, this epic attempt fails. It appears as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes united by a too intelligent social comment. <br /> <br /> It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer looks out and says "Is not it smart? I'm not smart? Is not that a biting social comment?" And, sadly, the answer is always "Ummmm ... no". Carry self-absorbing things that look more like a soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie ... and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Fortunately, he died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
