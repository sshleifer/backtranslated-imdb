A very delicate issue: the 15-year-old girl abandoned by the mother as a baby and going to visit her, is still ignored, raped by her mother's boyfriend and becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth of this situation. Too much time is devoted to persecution with the truckers who transport the baby. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma, never sees him cry, except once, being fed, his diaper has been changed during the entire transport test of the truck). I would have liked to see more of the interrelations, more focus on the fact that this girl was underage, this should have been raised in court immediately. <br /> <br /> And this was a real story! He deserved a better description than that! <br /> <br /> If it were not for the subject, I would have awarded it closer to a rating of 0. I rented this in the library. Only later did I discover that it was a movie for television. <br /> <br /> oh well
