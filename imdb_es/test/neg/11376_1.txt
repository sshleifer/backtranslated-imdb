Comparing this movie with anything from Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best I can say about this is that it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are the quality of the drama of the high school (except Marcia Gay Harden, which is quite good, given the material with which he has to work). In addition, cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the capricious beauty of Gaudí's architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy the seasoning, the pathos and the dark and peculiar comedy of Almodóvar's films, you will not find any of them here. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
