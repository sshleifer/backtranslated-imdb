This is probably the most irritating show I have seen in my entire life. It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have seen. Everything is simply bad. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Every week a different situation arises for parents to manage their children. <br /> <br /> I could not understand, what kind of idiot this mess would produce in the first place, not to mention several seasons. The script is bad, very bad ?? It contains both cheesiness and unethical jokes that you normally see in the rated film R or NC-17. Especially for the young character where all he does is indulge himself, is that what one calls family shows humor? The casting is also horrible, because all you see is a period of actors really BAD. <br /> <br /> Final Word: This Show is a real torture !! This program provides an image of how an irresponsible parent can be (using power incorrectly instead of understanding). It is a million times far from reality. Listening to Kenny G would be a god send compared to this. Seeing the washing machine spinning would not hurt your eyes as much as this program. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Rating: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The show is so bad That even the cast mother takes her daughter out of the show.
