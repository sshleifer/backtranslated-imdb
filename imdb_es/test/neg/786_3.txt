Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: is a cast of stars, but "The Box" proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid film. The premise seems promising: a couple is visited by a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone will die, a person they probably will not know. Then what do you do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, history derails completely. Vague and boring plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving NASA, nothing is explained here. <br /> <br /> "The box" is a disappointment, it could have been much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story, that explains the continuity errors.
