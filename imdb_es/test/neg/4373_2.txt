Policemen Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five black juvenile backpacking and end up stranded on the sticks when their truck breaks. After a deadly confrontation with a white and racist bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the mindless teenagers uses a spell to summon Killjoy, who finally appears halfway through this drill in an unsatisfactory and larger make-up job, more greasy than it looks like he could slip out of his head at any moment. He then proceeds to kill the stupid characters while spitting out some of the worst of a single line heard since Hee Haw was canceled. <br /> <br /> The performance of the "teenagers" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the FX stinks and seems a lot cheaper than the first movie. Although I enjoyed it in his previous Troma films, Trent Haaga (trying to imitate Jim Carrey here) is horrible and can not compete with the hyperactive Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (who at least had some silly laughs). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin for studies of the Full Moon, whose reputation as a direct franchise of fun has completely disappeared since the TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
