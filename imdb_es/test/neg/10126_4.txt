For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that the first attempt of The X Files in a vampire episode should land squarely. 3 has always puzzled me and, at the risk of sounding like the horrible Hans Keller, I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a puzzle that has pieces that do not match the box, and the result is that you spend a nice evening by the fire trying to match the sky that really is sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you see the episode again and no matter how much attention you give it. I know this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by teenage vampires who will drink my blood while listening to Busted, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. I've always been a werewolf.
