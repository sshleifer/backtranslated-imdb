This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography 'Wired', written by Bob Woodward. The whole film is narrated in flashback without chronological order, where after the death of John Belushi we see an angel accompanying Belushi during some points. of their life. Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is quite credible, but completely lacks the devastating force of Belushi, and his game is only a pale animation. The director, even more, can not continue the story, that's why you do not know the book is very confusing. But the worst thing is that they have introduced Bob Woodward who spoke with Belushi before he died. Because of these negative points, the film is just an attempt to narrate the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
