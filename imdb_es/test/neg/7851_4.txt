German actor and super hungry Paul Muni, who never saw a scene he did not want to chew, becomes a "black face" to play a humble Mexican immigrant who lives in Los Angeles and makes his way in the world. If this squeaky vehicle reminds someone of the performance of Al Pacino's minstrel as an uneducated Cuban in the SCARFACE remake, do not be too surprised. The characters are quite similar, and both go crazy when the script asks for it. Hispanics around the world should feel very offended by Muni's exaggerated performance, since this dizzying Mexican living the American dream has the damned consequences. I guess Benicio DelToro's grandfather was not available. A discolored young blonde, Bette Davis, plays one of Muni's love interests; she finally goes crazy for love of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute cry, Davis is the only reason to see this racially offensive trap. There is an absolutely delirious near the end when Muni asks the girl of his dreams to marry him, a white girl from the upbringing with one of those accents of the 30s harassed and similar to those of Hollywood that he loved so much Hollywood, and she calls him a Wild and brutal, from "a different tribe". Muni immediately becomes Mr. Hyde and pursues her to an untimely death. In the final scene, a repentant Muni tells his sober-faced priest that he will return with his own people, his own class. End of the movie. Finis That's all she wrote. It was said that Muni had hired a middle-class Mexican as a driver to study the speech pattern and physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
