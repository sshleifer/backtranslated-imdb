Five Fingers is so bad, I almost do not know where to start. So let me admit first, that I've only seen the first half hour. When the first finger was cut, I thought that sleeping was a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Could not the producer, the director and / or the screenwriter consult a chess fan? Like me? They should have used a digital chess clock and not an analog one. This big mistake makes the mental pressure on Martijn just a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn go out with a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a case is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Calling me a retard is, of course, an insult to all those people who suffer with an IQ below the average. On the other hand, to my knowledge, delays do not play chess. I do. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the script, of course. Just compare the little smart movie Hard Candy. To keep the viewer in a grip, the information must be revealed little by little. A good turn from time to time also helps. I understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. Any intelligent person can guess what it is. Of course, this only generates more questions: why is the travel guide killed? Oh my, why should I even care? The whole movie focuses on one thing: chopped fingers. The manufacturers have not even learned the lesson of Hitchcock: it is exciting to explode a bomb. It is more exciting to show the tick of that bomb. But no, we do not see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown ends. I will not waste any more words on this shit. Go see Hard Candy.
