A new guard in the armored truck is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. There are no bad guys, so nobody will get hurt, right? Of course, things go wrong and the new guard decides to be aware and do things right by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I admit that I really did not have any interest in this. movie, but I also had no interest in Fantastic Mr Fox, and that movie was my top ten of the year. The armor is even more disappointing than I thought. Like a movie of theft, can not deliver the goods, is boring and full of plots and jumps in logic that one will hurt thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie somehow has a really great cast, but the film does not even use this to its advantage. Everyone seems wasted on wooden characters who make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting advantage that is never charismatic and that never makes the public want to do shit. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the robbery and plays Mr. Nice Guy at first, then, when things do not go well, he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive cast includes Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. None of them do much, and when they really do something, there is not much reasoning behind. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even with a run time of less than 90 minutes, it felt dragged. How long can a movie make about a man stuck somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and was even more restricted. The jumps of logic with respect to the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are records every hour or so? According to my understanding, the whole plan was to take the trucks to an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to be hit and burn the trucks. Then they left with the money. Of course, something goes wrong, or there would be no movie, right? Through a series of unfortunate events, the so-called hero has been trapped inside the truck with an injured officer. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his team banging on the doors to enter. How exiting. <br /> <br /> The script asks that our hero have financial problems, he could lose his house, which in turn will make him lose his brother. You see, their parents died and only the two of them take care of each other. So now he has a reason to join the robbery. At first he did not want to go in, but his money problems are the right push to throw him to the core of things. How convenient. <br /> <br /> The whole Armored turn in the robbery genre is that it comes from an armored truck, from those who drive it. After that basic premise, the film falls flat on his face. I found myself wanting it to end every time someone spoke. Speaking of the end, it stinks. <br /> <br /> Saltala.
