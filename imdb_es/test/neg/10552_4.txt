Here there were good characters, played by nice-looking actors and actresses, plus he had a famous band and some famous dancers ... but the movie just did not work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to die. The dialogue was silly, the humor (mainly that of Milton Berle) was downright stupid and the music just did not go up in my alley. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of the band, anyway, and if I listen to "In The Mood" one more time, I'll puke. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous actress and skater Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so outdated that it is no longer fun. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello, etc., were very funny for the crowds in the 40s and 50s, but the humor changes, and the funny thing of that time is not today.
