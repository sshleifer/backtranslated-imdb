This film is trash because, for many reasons, it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also garbage. Let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is only looking for another way to be the center of attention, and others that just this kind of garbage belong to the prison. The movie itself, based on the book, was also horrible. the only reason why this murder case turned into such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, through the marriage of his aunts, to the Kennedy family and it's ridiculous that people still believe that this family It has the ability to do and cover up Murders: they are just one family and the middle part of the United States needs to overcome the obsession. This poor man, and his family, have been persecuted by the police for years, they could not get Tommy, so they went after Micheal. It's amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence he supports that he did not, in addition to the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have prevented this trial from being resubmitted after TWENTY years for the love of . God, do not look at this garbage
