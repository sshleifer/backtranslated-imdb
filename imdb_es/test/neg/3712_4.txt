If you like bad SE, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like that kind of movies. I can not help but smile when I see this kind of movies ... What did the producers, actors, directors and people of SE think when they made this movie? Do not wait for an "Abyss" or "Alien", just a horror movie (very) on a low budget. <br /> <br /> There is a good time "splashed" when a boy's head is shot, but for most, the horror is quite docile. The final monster is also great. <br /> <br /> It only has 73 minutes, so you can not go wrong there. Maybe you can pick it up at your local video store or watch it on TV. I'm sure you'll have a good time watching him. <br /> <br /> But do not say you were not warned .............
