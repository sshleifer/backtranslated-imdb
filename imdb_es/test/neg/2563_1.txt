Steven Seagal played in many action movies. Most of them were bad but not as bad as The Patriot. This is a low-budget Z series action movie. After the Delta Force Operation, the War Certificate, the Substitute 2, the Plato Race, the Base, the Impulse, the Sabotage, etc. comes the Patriot. Now surely Steven Seagal will be considered a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The stage was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe due to the very bad actors) and the 4.25 dollars that you spend when renting The Patriot are called Lost Money. I give it 0 and a half (for laughs) of 5.
