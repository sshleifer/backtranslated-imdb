Ken Shamrock is destroyed. (He does not die, which is sad). 4. It leaves you wanting more ... aspirin. 5. The creators of the movie are the kind of people who do not care what their monster looks like. "Just give him a $ 30 mask." "Good enough for me." 6. The scarecrow runs a chick. AMAZING. 7. Filmmakers do not really make their actors sing or play the guitar. 8. The scarecrow uses a volleyball stick as a javelin and impales the uncle who does not actually play the guitar or sing. 9. The Scarecrow can drown a guy in about 3 seconds. 10. It makes you think about all these things and write them for other people. God, what am I doing?
