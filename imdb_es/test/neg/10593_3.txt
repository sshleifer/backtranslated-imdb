I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was great. I have some of the "books" that were written based on the series in my silkscreen collection, and they are quite light, so I did not expect much from the movie. That's a good thing, because this movie was bad with a long strap. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a film that is so faithful to the success of the sixties. The cinema audience, however, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half from the original concept of Mod Squad, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (sound tinplate) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, in big screen In the 1960s, we did not care much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. It was that, another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password". <br /> <br /> Qualifying this "episode" with the usual theater premieres, the story was ... well, I'm not sure I should. Say because I'm not sure there's one. Drugs are bad? Whatever is. The script was silly. When the characters exchange dialogues and advance in the plot with lines like "I heard him say it on the phone" and "I think I have a plan", we are really in trouble. No wonder the performance was terrible: nobody knew how to say those idiotic lines. <br /> <br /> If it were Claire Danes, right now I would go after my agent with a flamethrower. (Actually, I think that everyone who is watching and watching the movie has the right to seek retribution). <br /> <br /> And where was the Mod in that squadron? I realize that these children just left the children's room, but did not anyone have a velvet suit? "Mod" only meant young and integrated? What happened to the white go-go boots? Maybe the costume department was going through the sand, but everything they got was dirty and dismal. <br /> <br /> Since the film was completely faithful to the original series, and it required a special behavior of the actors, cameramen, specialists. etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still do not like it. If I wanted to see the criminal drama of the 60s, I would buy DVDs. No thanks.
