An intelligent and transvestite little boy finds success in the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional education. Shirley MacLaine directed and stars as the girl's grandmother, and it's always fascinating to see the long-time actors who have the opportunity to direct a film, the material that attracts them and the actors with whom they choose to work. Here, the only person well launched in "Bruno" is MacLaine. Child actors seem to have been chosen for their brightness and tenderness, and MacLaine, with a soft heart, holds his close-ups for terribly long periods; None of these cherubs seem natural, nor the lines that fall without awareness of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even between them. While the father dissatisfied with the child, poor Gary Sinise looms around the edges, with a fake shame, always with an expression of pain on his face. Towards the end of the film, MacLaine turns all this into a series of hugs scenes, and even concludes with the boy embracing the Pope in Rome! Another unholy treatise of a talented actress turned director, who, like Sally Field and her film "Beautiful", seems to be able to stop winking and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for deception, and the innocence of childhood as a tick. The children in this cast roll their eyes, know how to guess with mature comments, use big words, but when a grieving child calls our pint-sized hero "gay", Maclaine's grandmother instructs him to go and eliminate it. in front of the media!). How about that for the progression? * since ****
