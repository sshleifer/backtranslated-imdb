More than just a character study and then a movie, COMPROMISED is just another relationship with the adornments made specifically for a young and objective audience. The direction seems very basic, with an evident dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser in front of the clueless one committed. COMMITTED can be seen sometimes and there is a small sense of originality on the part of Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> COMMITTED has no objective during the first twenty minutes. We know Joline, but the movie starts when her husband disappears. Joline goes looking for him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. Other times the film creeps. The second half is more fun, since we see that Joline's spiritual antics turn to the more intense ones. The annoying guitar music is horrible, but it may be a necessary evil, since COMPROMISED offers very little anyway. An average movie hampered by some completely useless moments, the only asset of COMMITTED is Heather Graham and Patricia Vel√°zquez.
