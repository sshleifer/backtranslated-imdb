Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing other drug dealers, the poor and unfortunate ... heh, Harlan, Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go directly to look for his girl, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he takes a job as a driver of an armored vehicle for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted on a secured paper). Max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intention of using his shipper, Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. Escaping the police, hiding the money and leaving Bruno (who had a loaded gun aimed at Harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he did not drive) after evading capture by ramming a huge garbage truck, Harlan faints. Accused of the murder of the police, among other things, as a result of the damage caused by the high-speed persecution, Harlan is imprisoned and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins forces with a prisoner, Ice (Treach), leader of one of the many gangs in the prison, which breaks with the plans to find Max and eliminate each member of his corrupt environment. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who says there are drugs involved. Harlan's desire to save a children's hospital is about to close and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach cross over talking in gangsta, while Buxton spends time trying to help Harlan, discovering the possibility that his boss is in collusion with Max. The character of Mancuso is a strange duck, which gives Rachel a lot of room for maneuver despite the threat she has for her career. Tighe appears for five minutes or more, which is a pity. The Harlan of Seagal escapes from prison and finds each and every one of Max's wealthy associates, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after breaking some skulls, breaking some dolls and breaking some bones. Treach speaks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to respond with kindness, causing some involuntary laughter. As expected, many people are shot and Seagal does not sweat. It is interesting to see Seagal in prison, among the convicts, help Treach when a group of "Eses" plans to take him out.
