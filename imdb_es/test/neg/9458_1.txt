Ah, yes, it is another account of the classic: "the sociopathic killer doctor creates Frankenstein and falls in love". <br /> <br /> From the same director who brought you such eternal classics as "10,000 Maniacs" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" movie practically cries out for the MST3K treatment. The assistant of the doctor even has connotations of Torgo in the classic "Hands: The hands of destiny". However, I do not know if the graphic, the seemingly false violence or the frequent stretches of tedium without dialogue could have scared the crew. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to get upset in this movie are for the hysterical "hypnosis" scene, the ridiculously serious ending and the background production values. Actually, I saw all the credits after this movie, for the same reasons that you are inclined to slow down your car when you go through a serious traffic accident. That and the genius of the final theme that sounds like a "My favorite things" diluted in a toy piano. Goblin this is not.
