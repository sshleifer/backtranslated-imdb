Harrison Ford playing at being a policeman in a crime thriller. The perfect ingredients for the best entertainment with Harrison return to their best Indy and Han Solo, protecting a witness of ruthless and ruthless assassins. How easy it is to be fooled. If the film concentrated on the main themes, assumptions, crime and suspense, instead of placing granaries and pushing ice creams in people's faces, it might have been worth it. Incredibly predictable with the best method of sending an enemy is with corn.
