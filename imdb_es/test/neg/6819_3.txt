Surely this movie could have had its fun times with people asking questions and I know that the movie is not supposed to be totally credible. The film made it too outrageous, for example, a girl like that never in a million years would go out with a guy like that also the people in the film had mediocre performances, the acting was so bad. Also, the bad plot could have done a better job on the script at least and focus more on the comedy. The comedy was also a bit dry and it became really boring after the first jokes, it was like 10mins was a laugh and an old one. This is going to end. It started to work. If you want a bit of acting mixed with a stupid argument and a romance, go see this movie.
