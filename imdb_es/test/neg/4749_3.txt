I was only fourteen years old when I first saw the Alien movies and immediately liked them. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her performance. In 1979 something eternal was born that the immortal series continued with a film no less legendary than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favorite. Unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. It was tense, illogical with senseless massacres. I did not like it at all, but I never thought that it would ever become a worse part in the future. Well, as it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad time, and should have been directed by a more talented director or should never have been done. But when I saw Alien vs. Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked and devastated. When I sat down and decided to see her full of doubts, even when I had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I do not understand how a movie can be made. Because this movie loses these three terms. What you get is a good massacre show without a story but with many annoying and boring dialogues. Loss of money and loss of time. This film is rather reckless, which honors fans from both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
