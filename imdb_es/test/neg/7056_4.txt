'Nuff said. An undercover police officer from the state capital is sent to a small county where the execution of Moonshine is rampant. He ends up getting pulled off the road by some local healers who have no idea he's an undercover cop (so they just walk away as happy as ever). He is soon being looked after by a woman and her three daughters, all in low cut blouses and short shorts (they must be 1970s lovers). He falls in love with one of the girls, but in the meantime, he still has to figure out who is doing all the moonlight and drive him to all the local bars and restaurants. He also has to deal with a fat sheriff and his incompetent assistant who believes he is the one who works on the moon because he is new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in a small town in the United States, in the style of the 70s. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
