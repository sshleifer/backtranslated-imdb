Are you kidding me? The music was so strong in this show that I often could not even hear the dialogue. And the music was not great. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when she walked in the door? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to having so little instant devastation. Anyone who investigates the effects of nuclear rain before writing this. I felt that a group of sitcom actors were sent to the place and I did not know what to do with the dramatic dialogue. And what does a Kansas teenager know about shopping in Soho ... could not we have had a better line here? He was bored to tears and just kept awake by the rumble of the mix of loud music.
