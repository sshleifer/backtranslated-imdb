Whoa, this is one of the worst movies I've seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I saw it last weekend, and we just kept seeing it with the hope that it would improve ... it was not like that ... <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is bad; It seems that it was filmed on video and transferred to the movie. The lighting is not excellent, which makes it difficult to read the facial expressions of the actors. The performance itself was cheesy, but I think it's acceptable for "another" horror movie for teenagers. The sound was a big problem: sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is not clear and / or is off. <br /> <br /> It has no real merit by itself; trying to ride on the skirt of "Sleepy Hollow". Do not bother with this.
