This is in fact the movie that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if you ever had some kind of excitement or even an interesting half story, it does not seem to have aged very well. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: an extremely confusing and slow-moving plot with current and current choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated lash sounds with every hit and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never reach its end. When the movie reached its emotional climax, it had been a long time since I had plucked all the wind to worry me. <br /> <br /> Look at it for its historical value as a landmark of Chinese kung fu cinema, just leave your expectations at the door, or you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
