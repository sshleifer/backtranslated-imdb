In The Ring, it was a video tape; a website was the problem in Feardotcom; the danger in Pulse came from computers; and the phone and a missed call counted on "you guessed it" deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the technology that causes all kinds of problems is an online game: those who play it end up dead soon after. How smart! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (who?), and with an impressive cast of twenty-somethings you may have seen before, but you probably can not remember where or what the hell their names are, this is a extremely derivative piece of film making directed directly to the horror set PG-13; Undoubtedly, experienced moviegoers will find Stay Alive extremely tedious, highly predictable and in the least frightening. <br /> <br /> The underdeveloped plot follows a group of players with extremely silly names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch and Swink!?!) who try to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims. Finally, they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who kills anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game until the end. <br /> <br /> With such a stupid story as this, viewers must expect a movie with many loose ends, not a bit of logic (who made the game, how and why it is never explained), very little in the road of terror or gore, and a silly closing scene to leave the door open for "God forbid" a sequel.
