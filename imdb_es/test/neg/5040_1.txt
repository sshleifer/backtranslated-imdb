I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the horrible plot lines, just say that this movie has a bad animation, an excessive performance, obvious lines of etiquette? These are some of his good qualities. If you are abandoned on an isolated island and the only link with the civilization you have is this movie, pass it on to the fish. I can not tell you how sorry I have been to see this horrible and horrible movie. Speaking of which, this movie supposedly a horror movie can not be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playability of some of the actors. <br /> <br /> Take care of yourself.
