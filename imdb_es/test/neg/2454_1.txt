Thursday June 9, 6:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall and Saturday June 11, 1:45 pm Broadway Performance Hall <br /> <br /> Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them, we would only see Spielberg, the Farrelly brothers, and films based on old comedies. They are the ones who take risks. They reap the rewards of success and suffer from failures. Max and Grace are definitely a failure. Michael Parness deserves credit for going out and making his first film that, according to him, led to bankruptcy. Maybe it's better to stay on stage if this movie is an indication of what to expect in the future. Although everyone warned me that I went to see Max and Grace anyway, hoping to discover something they did not discover. Start well enough, a party for Max in his parents' house with a soft, warm light, with the camera floating at interesting angles. As soon as we see that Max has hung up, an obvious scam by Harold and Maude, everything goes directly into the tank. How could he do this without being seen in the middle of a birthday party? In this case, how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to marry and do so with the blessings of all parties involved? In the question and answer session after the film, David Krumholtz suggested that the whole story was the surrealistic dream of his character Max. This story is so poorly written that the comment sounded more like an excuse. The film does not seem to have been made with few resources, more reason to be so disappointed with the results. What is meant to be funny is not, but it is offensively bad. The continuity is neglected, the lighting is terrible and the effects seem cheap and forced. BPH has capacity for less than three hundred and was surprisingly full, but I saw at least thirty or forty stops in the first half hour. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing since I never leave before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks that this is "one of the best scripts" he has read, it seems that he needs to catch up with his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independent event I've seen since Bubba-Ho-tep.
