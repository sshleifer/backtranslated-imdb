Unfortunately, Koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the production company ran out of money. All the sets in the first half of the film were meticulously recreated from the book, something that has been missing in many other Koontz films. Despite their other (numerous) disadvantages, I continued to watch in anticipation of a truly great scenario. Incorrect. By the time the detectives appear in the crackhead apartment (in the book), the film has run out of funds and one of the most suspenseful scenes in the book is ruined. Where the book offered a spooky discovery, a search and a chase for the boys 'apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the boys' car. <br /> <br /> Let's face it: Koontz writes without a budget in mind, because imagination is free. If a Koontz novel becomes a decent movie, no one will go to see it, because they have been disappointed many, many, many times before. This is why Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is now only Frankenstien. If he had seen his work massacred so many times, he would leave early if it seemed like it was happening again.
