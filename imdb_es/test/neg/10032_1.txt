I went into a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I will not say the name because I am a dedicated client. I have been satisfied with every item I bought there before this. The Bell Witch Haunting was on display in the front of the store. (I could mention that this is the only store where I have seen it for sale.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered that it was supposed to have really happened. I was very excited and could not wait to see it. I had great expectations for it. I could not believe what I saw when I saw it. It did not look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I had the impression that it was supposed to be a horror movie. I mean, the movie was supposed to be about a witch chasing you. This is not a horror movie. You will not jump out of your seat watching this movie. I gave the film all the possibilities in the world to improve as it progressed. I swear I did it. It never got better. There were several scenes in which this little boy pooped and urinated on him. I did not find anything entertaining. I saw the whole movie with disbelief that the store would really sell me this. I guess that's how bad this economy is. I have this to say to the cast and the team. Do not show this movie as material to get other cinematographic works. Do not do it I say it sincerely. I congratulate you for trying. For the people who have bought this. I say this. Do not sell your copy to someone. They could get very angry. Have a nice day everyone.
