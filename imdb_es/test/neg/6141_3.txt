I like the concept of CSI, but the show is ruined by a serious wooden performance. The forensic doctor has the best lines and delivers them in an arched and casual way that animates the story. Unfortunately, it has little time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Jorja Fox always look and act so unhappy? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious matter, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with lack of humor and total lack of personality. I can not imagine dating Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; What would you talk to any of you? I'm waiting for the episode when, at the end of a shift, Catherine takes a remote control, points it at Grissom, stops it and puts it in a closet until the next day.
