I'm beginning to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are glorified screen tests for young and emerging talents. Get a screenwriter for the first time, an inexperienced director, some television actors looking for their big shot on the big screen and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a bit better than most recent offers, but it's still completely in the book; Filled with weft holes and genre clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplistic. The slim 87-minute runtime is heavily quilted with inconsequential friends and a cheating boyfriend with no sense. The killer is devoid of even the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael or even the killer of the original movie, and as a result, is never particularly terrifying. The police behave in such an incredibly inefficient and lazy manner as to be on the verge of undue professional conduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to the procedures he handled with Lara Croft, but his management style is decidedly generic, with no indicators of real talent or vision. The presentations are routine, the dark corridors replace the genuine horror and the fears are of the tired variety of cat in the closet. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking and production design, however, are above average for this type of film. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are some moments of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although it lacks an ounce of dramatic originality, it acts as a fairly satisfactory dark house. 'Thriller, and keeps interest for longer than most of your ilk.
