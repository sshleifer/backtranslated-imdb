Here is a film that clearly bets to be marketed as exotic for audiences who are not familiar with its subject. <br /> <br /> An attempt at fiction and document hybrid, "Kadosh" falls awkwardly between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. To realize his careless handling of details, one does not have to go beyond the initial scene, where it is quite obvious that the ultra-Orthodox protagonist does not even know how to properly put on his t'filin. More generally, the tedious presentation of memory style details (in this case the ultra-Orthodox Jewish ritual) is the role of a manual, not a good documentary; the latter must provide a principle of organization (a gestalt, if desired) for the viewer, so that it can emerge with a better understanding of what is seen. This clearly does not happen here, since the ultra-Orthodox ritual is becoming even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining everything verbally during the film's premiere campaign; Cinematically, however, this is a severe case of stuttering. As a fiction feature, on the other hand, suffers from plainness of character, simplicity of plot and frankness of message. At some points I felt I was watching a caricature. (For example, the consummation scene of the wedding night: without going into details in angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically this could not be a realistic representation of human sex, however wild it may be). <br /> <br /> There are no subtleties in this movie. The intelligent manipulation of the tracks, which stimulates the imagination and the thought of the spectator to take an active part in the cinematographic text, which I think is a mark of a good characteristic, is completely absent. On the contrary: when I saw the film, I felt, at times, as if force-fed over and over again with the same content already chewed and too obvious. It is, in fact, as the director Gitai himself put it in an interview, an "architectural change of objects in space", and then color the scenes with the appropriate emotions when the plot is requested and advanced in its proper and predictable way; but the spark, that creative spark, goblin, dark, inarticulable (let's not forget that "Kadosh" is supposedly a tragedy), what projects on a two-dimensional screen the spell that makes it an extension of the world of viewers, is missing without leave a trace Maybe a work of a visual engineer, perhaps an unsophisticated ideologist; Definitely not from a true filmmaker. What I saw was a game of passion for animated themes instead of real people of complexity and complexity. The performance, in general, could not transcend this flatness of direction of a forced idea (sometimes even tortured) in the film. A notable exception, although relatively minor, was that of mikve-lady and mother, both interpreted by the excellent and experienced Lea Koenig. a portion of exotic, in addition to a simple and heartbreaking melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct, to torment my friends of interest. The conclusion here, all said, is that for a considerable part of the film I just got bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even a pioneering achievement in the use of an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as the setting for a film, for which Mr. Gitai and his team deserve all the praise, I found "Kadosh" as Nadosh (Hebrew for "trivial").
