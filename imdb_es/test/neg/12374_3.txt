Before starting, I can say that I hope you have already eaten when you are reading this. Why? Because, after seeing this movie for the first time, the appearance and sound of the bird made me want to eat chicken after the words "The end" appeared on the screen. So do not say they did not warn you. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears could have directed "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" (a good movie and one of the most important examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" does not It's that giant movie. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks airplanes and cities and occasionally it is a man in parachute. The beast is giant, except in scenes where it is considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? Scary? It could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like a puppet that escaped from Sesame Street.
