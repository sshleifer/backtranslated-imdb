Seeing this film, with its deterministic cause and effect, the wall-to-wall clich√©s and the trite feeling, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is how Barrie's life developed? You see it in a position of disagreement. Hollywood biopics are no longer based on individual lives, they are just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life, it would be filled with such a perfect synchronization that you would hardly recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be eliminated by some simplistic background story that explains everything. Your story would resemble "Rocky" because it is the only arc of life that Hollywood already knows how to produce. We could not leave the audience reflecting on anything that would remain open as they leave. This film does not trust an audience to solve things without being brought to them. I perceived the reference eons of the captain's hook / mother before the movie literalized it to me. I could see the turn of the 25 children per day. <br /> <br /> This is a completely average movie. It's not horrible, but it's not great. Therefore, it is likely that they will bathe with some Oscar awards next year. There is nothing that the Academy likes more than congratulating itself for having finally noticed the patterns implemented in the last thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the New Yorker article "Lost Boys" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> "Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also loved his children, and it may be unfair that" Finding Neverland " omit, for reasons of rationalization, the scene, when Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, while Arthur was very alive when Barrie first came into consciousness and, little by little, the family home Llewellyn Davies. <br /> <br /> "Finding the Land of Neverland" is a weeping one.From the moment Barrie met George and Jack, and we began to reflect on the means by which they could become immortal, the History is sad, but the reality is even more grim: 1907 - Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies of jaw cancer 1910 - Sylvia dies of lung cancer The five children are orphaned, Barrie becomes his tutor 1915. George is killed in World War I. War rld, fighting with his regiment in F Landes 1921: Michael, a university student in Oxford, drowns while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, once recovered, are clinging. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, then an esteemed editor, threw himself into an underground train in London. We should not presume to read a tormented mind, but we can notice in passing that, had he lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and, therefore, one imagines, a new wave of interest in "Peter Pan" . "??" that terrible masterpiece ", in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.
