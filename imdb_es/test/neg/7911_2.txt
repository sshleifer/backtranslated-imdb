If nothing else, he deserves to be remembered for that achievement. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. A really bad thing. Separating it point by point would be a waste of time. The best that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple plane in it. Do yourself a favor ... go buy a picture of a purple plane, and you'll have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely in the category of "What the! ^ @@ & *! They were thinking ????"
