I was excited about the concept that my favorite comic book hero was on television ... and very disappointed with the final result. <br /> <br /> The only "incredible" thing was the tracking of the wall (despite the visibility of the cable). I did not think that Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly of a different constitution from the guy who did the acrobatics in the spider suit. You could say they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Of course, I can also see in modern Spider-Man movies when I see Tobey Macguire and when I see CGI. But that is from a trained eye and experience working with CGI. Still, the 70s version could have been better despite the lack of special effects. <br /> <br /> The webs were weird and looked like strings that seemed to wrap around things instead of sticking to them. And what about giving him a spider cell phone to go around? Hello? He is the person who uses the web in the net. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... I did not mean to be so nervous, but our beloved wall tracker deserved better.
