This show is just horrible. I liked watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that The Amanda show, it was also fun, but this is simply INCREDIBLE. In my opinion, seeing this I felt like seeing those --- Seltzberg movies, painful and dirty. it's about 3 silly kids @ $$ who make a moody web show (while stealing the Ithing hole) while their retarded brother is making sculptures (he has no life). The cast is shit, Megan, Drake and Josh, is manly (AHHHHHHH!), An ugly b! tch is Sam and some child that they took out of the street touches Fred. all I saw of this (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a clay movie, he also played an arcade game called PAC-rat (genius), Sam and Carly were delayed in their web program and Fred being an idiot the only episode I saw (I do not remember the title) where Fred is unlucky not to send an email. I find videos on YouTube more fun than this garbage. and why the hell do they get youtube jack @ $$ fred, have AVGN cancel the program with its dirty mouth. only this show jumps
