Admirable but weak film of James Bond, mainly because as much the hero (Bond) as the villain (Blofeld) were seriously moody. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but stupid fellow in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish their credibility, but their saying of phrases like "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." simply is not effective to establish it as this mundane and soft rogue. Savalas does not do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior are more suitable for a mafioso mobster. The characters best portrayed in the film are those of Tracy and his father. But the performances of those actors when they share the screen with Lazenby only serve to emphasize their deficiencies as an actor. This film is too long (140 minutes) for a Bond movie and offers no emotion until the break of Bond Mountain, where it begins to play. This film tries hard, but it falls short. Many elements of Bondian are present and the climatic battle is first class, but I always get the feeling that something is missing from seeing this.
