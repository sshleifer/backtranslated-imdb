I had been waiting for this movie since Lost World came out. It did not bother me that Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and here, I just expected a good monster movie. It was "dinosaurs eat people." However, it was disappointing even at that level. <br /> <br /> To begin with, there were not enough people to eat, and although I will keep it a secret about how many people eat, it was not enough. Also, although there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly enough "dinosaurs". And many dinosaurs, like the osaurus on their backs, with their backs and a club in their tail, only made cameos and did not do much considering how great they are. <br /> <br /> (HOME SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I have read estimate that their body weight is about 15 pounds, while the film makes them seem closer to 300. Worse, they could not eat anyone, not even splashed on rocks when dropped from above . There was no end to the movie, either, it was just, suddenly, the credits. (END OF SPOILERS) I wonder if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion may be that they taught the Pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into their pockets and get their $ 7. Go rent the Carnosaur series; At least you will not be disappointed.
