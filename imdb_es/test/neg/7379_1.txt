As Anthony Bourdain said: "I wanted to put my head in a bucket of bleach, take out my eyeballs and jump off a cliff." This sums up my feelings about this pathetic loss of human effort. Artless, self-indulgent, thoughtless, and simply bad. Bad beyond comprehension. What more can I say? If you have the bad luck to be in an area where this piece of idiotic garbage is playing, please have mercy on your soul and avoid it at all costs.
