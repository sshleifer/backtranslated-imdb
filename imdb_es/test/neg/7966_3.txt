There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a director with great talent. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have withstood the test of time and are highly visible to this day. This list could include The 39 Steps, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, The Birds, Shadow of a Doubt, and some other movies. <br /> <br /> However, "Suspicion" is It does not age well at all and it's really so hard to see that I think it was probably a bad movie even by the standards of 1941. The list of scenes that work well could be included in a matchbox with a crayon. The script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the performance seems so forced and wooden and fond of the border at all times, which is almost incredible. Joan Fontaine tries to prop things up but she is on a slippery slope and Cary Grant does not provide much help. His performance is so bad at times that I have seen better performances in theater plays in high school or in theater experience classes at the university, where a chemical engineer acts for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes of Seeing this movie, you might look for the DVD case in the dark to see if you accidentally chose some kind of special version that was improvised without any editing. <br /> <br /> The theme is serious, however, the film has a silly and trite feeling that seems so out of place that you numb with perplexity. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is basically inadmissible and another very bad, very overrated movie.
