KK should be devoted to singing, this whole movie was a great bore. I can not understand the cruelty of the boys and the romance between Miles and KK, the sex scenes had no inspiration either. The end was horrible, unsolved, there must be a reason to murder. And all the voyeurism of the boy was strange ... the mother always struggled with the boy, do not you think he would get something from Freudian with her? And why did not someone teach KK how to speak with inflection instead of monotonous? <br /> <br /> I'm glad that I only paid $ 1.00 to rent this. <br /> <br />
