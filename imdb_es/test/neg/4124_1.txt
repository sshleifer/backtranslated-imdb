In short, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular, so to speak. A new executive director comes to clarify things and make sure that the reputation of the company improves. She does this by leaking confidential information from the company to the press ... Do you believe this? In addition, she begins to dismiss people she has never seen. Amazing uh? A pacifist group tries to destroy the mainframe of the company, because there are the planes located of those secret weapons. This mainframe is located in the lower part of the building, hidden in a kind of vault. Of course, the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot that is the best killer machine, which looks like an 'Alien' from the Alien movies. The mad scientist likes the female executive director. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and thus protects his work, increases the chain of command and makes the film interesting. The pacifists are associated with the CEO and another person from the board of directors to escape the robot. Further down the line, they agree to fly this evil computer computer, while avoiding the robot. They also discover that the factory was developing a man part, part soldier machine. They can erase a person's memory and replace it with that of a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists becomes such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot. I guess the mad scientist also wrote the script for this movie. This super soldier looks and acts in a very similar way to Robocop, although it is not so much fun. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to this. People run, are chased by a killer robot, feel hurt by that, but do not seem worried about that, besides limping a bit, and, of course, the CEO is the main character of this film, and can not be killed . I mean, it survives every attack, explosion, whatever. I will not bother you because of the persecution, let's jump at the end. They have many weapons, yes, the pacifists too and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they empty all the weapons of the killer robot. They enter an elevator that is used to clean the exterior windows. And then, the executive director also knows some magic, on the roof she complained about not having bullets, and like magic, the weapon recharges. In this way, she can shoot the wires and let the elevator plummet 70 floors or so, and let it stop just above the ground surface by pulling on the brake. And to top it off, the police are waiting for you. The robot jumps after them, and kills the cops. Hilarious, no? The robot chases them through the vault where the mainframe is, and when the robot is finally so close to it that it can touch or kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist did not want to be killed. A better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist. Although he is the one who made this film visible. At this time I was already trying to get the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie is worth so much, and that is why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster, and I'm not talking about the Death Machine.
