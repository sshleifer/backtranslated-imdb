Well, I'll start with this: I love horror movies, neither the worst plot nor the most terribly terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; This is the worst movie of all time. It even surpasses the Mean Guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay tribute. <br /> <br /> However, the involuntary humor was only funny until half of the movie had passed, after which everything was so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews were divided a bit; and you who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 onwards; I KNOW YOU ARE ALLEGING! GOOD !! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have a little bit of the same notion of what quality is; You can not be real. <br /> <br /> All that is worth mentioning about the contents has already been summed up quite well, so I leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where the hooded type of rubber mask drags the woman from one side to the other through the kennel for ten minutes, with a score so terrible music and The amazing dialogue between the two, really does it for me.
