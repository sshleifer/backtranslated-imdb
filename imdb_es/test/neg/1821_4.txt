Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson give good performances with South / New Orleans accents in this detective film. It's worth watching his scenes and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors manage to entertain us no matter what the film looks like, it seems. The plot of the film shows potential, but one has the impression of seeing the film that did not perform as well as it could have done. The fact that it is saturated by an uninteresting secondary plot and mostly uninteresting hijackers really confuses things. The movie is worth watching, if only for entertainment Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
