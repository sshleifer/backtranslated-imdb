What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This movie is so dissociative and messy that I literally lost a bit of my sanity after it ended. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to point out what exactly is completely crazy. It's not just the hilarious techno music, or the medieval "out of time" / Blade Runner / wild west / Highlander, or the weird CGI monster "Grendel" that looks like a man made with animated sausages, or even the monster "mother" of Grendel, "which resembles an Alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when he remained in the tanning bed for too long. All those things are strange, but what is really the strangest thing in this movie is acting. I just can not explain. This script is obviously ridiculously silly, but the actors exude a deadly seriousness through all of this. Lambert is always weird, and usually it's a bit boring, but for this he has entered the territory of Dolph Lundgrin: I can not help it, I just start laughing every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie credit for being completely crazy and crazy instead of conservative and boring. I will always take a strange catastrophe from a movie instead of an absolutely mediocre one. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you plan to see Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours later wandering the streets somewhere. Type of nightmare, hyperactive catatonic stunning. It is true. When I finished my journey of the spirit of Beowulf, I awoke in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. Next to me was a dead wolf, and later I discovered that I had a handful of human teeth in the pocket of my shirt. My VOW copy of Beowulf sat on a stone altar built hastily nearby, consecrated with candles and withered flowers. The tape told me to walk. I got up and walked.
