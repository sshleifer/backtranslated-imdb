This is, by far, the worst and most stupid show I've seen on television. It is almost physically painful to see an adult (over twenty years old) who does nothing more than torture and make fun of his parents, who always seem to have no idea of ​​the stunts they are forced to endure by their foolish son and equally stupid. friends. Of course, I know that their parents are involved in that, but I really hate how they always act as if they were completely caught by surprise. It seems false everywhere. And I really hate the introduction of the show, in which a voice-over asks "Bam Margera, WHAT will you think next?!?!" (Anyway, I think that's the way it is), and Bam himself answers: "Whatever I want!" - WOW! Bam is really a hell, he lives at home with mom and dad! -Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced with a good-taste beep, but we received the message. Bam is the true rebel, at least in his opinion. Of course, Bam and his group of numb numbs point to an audience of teenagers, and of course it's an MTV show, but please raise the bar a bit. It is painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
