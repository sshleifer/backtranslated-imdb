Imagine this: a high school. Except that it is a boarding school, and children do not have parents nearby. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And all the children are thin, white and beautiful, with the exceptional minority or fat token to interpret the marginalized "strangers". And there are no reasonable rules, such as how they live together, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stalls, a sushi bar and a complimentary laptop per student. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: A The girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a school that used to be only for boys. Absolutely perfect in every way, she is smart, pretty, slim, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the kids in the school love her, and all the girls want to be her friends. She is the one that everyone goes for advice, the one that saves the day with a simplistic plan and is simply wonderful. Pity that none of this makes it pleasant. <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to believe that if we do not even get close to Zoey's perfection, we're bad people? In the program, nothing is her fault, and if someone contradicts her, she is presented as the bad boy (Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for itself instead of just agreeing with the princess every time. <br /> <br /> Her loyal following of blind followers is: Chase, the average fool Ass who has a secret crush on her, Michael, the symbolic black man (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a aspiring and anorexic actress, snob airhead, Quinn, the clever but clueless girl when it comes to teenagers, and Logan, the rich idiot who has a soft side. Yes, this program basically throws stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What bothers me, however, is that everyone tries to pretend they are normal children. They complain that Logan makes too much money while they have to work themselves, although they already attend too good a boarding school and have relatively good things that many teenagers can not afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, have almost no homework and tan almost every day. Wow, they have it difficult! Any other problem? I'm too handsome, rich and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what's 101 for?) Is Nick's attempt to portray the teenagers realistically. Except that they managed to glimpse the reality, they did not like it, and decided to give the children lives like the asses of The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least the set is nice.
