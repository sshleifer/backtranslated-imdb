I am very interested in animal children and I have read many novels by Edger Rice Burroughs, but this horrible movie did not keep me interested, nor could I support all the absurd and unreal scenes. I only managed to sit in the part of Africa and the first days of John in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unreal' and 'frankly silly'! The actors in monkey suits looked like extra-large chimpanzees, instead of great apes (there's a difference). They did not move with the grace that a wild animal would do. (To compare, see some of the best movies in Planet of the Apes, where they trained their actors to move simia). Monkeys eat large pieces of meat, as far as I know, it is not a common practice of apes. I'm a jerk for animal stories, but the script did not make me worry about the monkeys. The great white hunters of the expedition who find John Clayton are completely caricatured. Clayton's parents were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it's a very long trip down the river to reach the coast. Give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even people who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. Far from there. Try to be a character study: unfortunately, the completely stupid part predominates! I did not read Tarzan de Burroughs books, but many of his other series were full of meaningful action and a heroic purpose! This movie is simply not there.
