I really enjoyed the first film and when it appeared again, without thinking or checking, I took a family of friends to see it. I was ashamed of having excited them so much. <br /> <br /> Disney processed the original movie just as the human body processes a delicious meal: it takes something good and it turns out ... well, you know. And having a dark-skinned person as an FBI man, the results of fingerprinting the informant were moderate. <br /> <br /> Taken as an isolated movie, I guess it's not so bad if someone likes that kind of stranger. thing, but when one has read the book or seen the first movie - horrible!
