*** Minor spoilers from the plot *** <br /> <br /> I must confess that I have a weakness for Wayne Crawford. I know very little about him, but he seems to have a lot of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs multiple tasks, from 3 to the man, the director, the producer and the scriptwriter, and deals with the story lines from the sub-basement. Despite this, the final product is usually fun for the non-demanding. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Below' features Crawford as a captain of a ramshackle charter ship, a bit like Bogart in 'Have and not have', the similarities between the films end here. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers looking for an accident, before being attacked by an invisible creature, almost like the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The shipwreck turns out to be that of 'The Devil', which fell centuries before. The ship was manned by heretical priests fleeing Spain, with a cargo of stolen Church treasure. This allows the introduction of several links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon, both in sight. The title of the film refers to this sunken Devil ship, rather than to any malevolent sea creature. <br /> <br /> Any flaw The movie has (and there are many) that it is fun to watch and do competently. You can not help but like a movie that, in the last 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in "From here to eternity" and the last line of "Casablanca".
