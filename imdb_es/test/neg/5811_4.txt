I totally agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at his best, and Spencer Tracy seems naive, simple and overly optimistic, both in love and in life; an idealistic role that performed better in 'Boys Town'. If you can get through the ridiculous scene of the crowd at the train station ... oh ... it's more like slapstick and it's not worthy of any cast actor. It is not the best performance by anyone. Miscast and misadjusted. The story is empty and several and the entry without rights is apparent. Hedy Lamarr is absolutely stunning herself, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can not match the sophistication of her beauty and costumes, and the movie is not that believable at least for that reason.
