Yes, we all know of the strange and small fascination of Dan Schneider for doing shows with young children and iCarly is no exception. Watch the girls move their toes and stick their tongues at the camera and wear tiny clothes and bikini. Yes, it makes you wonder if these programs were made for teenagers or for a degenerated older crowd. Either way, the program is not so good compared to Dan Schneiders, other programs like the much higher Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The program is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) living alone and having to cope on their own while their father is in the Army and his mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has an evil friend named Sam and they make a very successful and award-winning web show called iCarly with her little friend from the Freddie school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young / knowledgeable web / business woman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress. who trusts to speak very loud and fast to convey his point of view and make strange faces. His brother Spencer is a somewhat miserly, eccentric and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor, who tries to be a bit difficult to look like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who would like this. Humor type of Joey Gladstone. Then there's Sam Puckett, a nasty, malicious brat of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy, who clearly uses hair extensions, since you can watch them disappear and then reappear from scene to scene. And, finally, Freddie Benson shows the camera nerdy cameraman and technical advisor, who is very much in love with Carly, but obviously will not get anywhere with her, which is played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go, like Freddies' mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of his annoying little friends to complete the cast. Most of the comedy is petty, like blowing Lewbert the janitor as a joke, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and hitting the table of scouting girls selling cookies. All adults come out as complete idiots while children know it, and certain main characters have absolutely no morals. Lying, cheating, stealing and violence are acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider. Yes, it's a children's show! What else can young viewers ask for? Well, with Dan Schneider we can expect the girls to dress in tight clothes and bikini and do some strange things, like stick their tongues at the camera and eat bananas. <br /> <br /> Programs like this are just what I do. However, young people like them and I guess it's no worse than any of the other types of junk that Nick gets in his young people. You can always find fans for anything that you see on TV, at least this is a little better than most of the things you see in Nick like that awful Naked Brothers show.
