Outside of Sweden you are not expected to have seen this movie. Happy you The cast includes several actors who are an important part of the modern history of the Swedish film. And still ... <br /> <br /> It seems that Peter Dalle had only one idea that lasted about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a younger GÃ¶sta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor that meets expectations. <br /> <br /> The credit that can be granted is for the photo, a splendid idea in black and white. The music is good. <br /> <br /> But, in general, it's a waste of gods and public time.
