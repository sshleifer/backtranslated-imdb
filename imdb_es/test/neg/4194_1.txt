Completely in accordance with another revision. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I searched for the only revision elsewhere and discovered that it was not even a real continuation. This was after I slowly pulled away from the TV with the remote in my hand, dropping my lower jaw lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of the filming is beyond the low budget. It does not even look like a damn movie. If I were watching images of a "home video" of a documentary, I would wait for it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> Totally ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope I saved others from renting it or being the owner of it.
