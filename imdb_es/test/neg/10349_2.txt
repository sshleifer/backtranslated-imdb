I have tried to see it twice, although I have not been able to overcome any of the two episodes. For me, it's basically not funny. I can tell where I should laugh, but I can not. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including those on the wall, like Married ... With Children and Family Guy, but this show just does not do it for me. The jokes are bad and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it's not. They are trying too hard to be different, and they are trying to force the mood. That style usually does not work very well. I do not think this show ends the season. Of course, I could be wrong.
