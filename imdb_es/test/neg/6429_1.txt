What can be said about such a pathetic film? <br /> <br /> - Very bad acting! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a badly beaten dog ... The other actress (the one who plays evil) resembles Ozzy Osbourne's female double with a horrible red wig. The other actors are so pitiful that it's not even worth describing them. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities but it does not go anywhere: we do not know anything about the meaning of "11:11", nor who Rayden really is, except for the simple "she is evil" or "she is a daughter of Revelation" ... it's not an explanation. We do not know why parents have been killed, what kind of danger is growing and why Sara was chosen. As the movie progresses, we only see scenes of pseudo fear, with bad music. In addition, the ending says nothing: we only see two possibilities, as if one of them was an extra scene or the director's version ... There is no argument, so there is no possible interpretation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I could not help but laugh. For example: the deserted library or the scenes of the bathroom, the silhouettes of ghosts walking with a gust of wind, ... there is even the "scary girl" in fashion, as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course, the main character is harassed at school and looks like a stereotypical goth girl (dark hair, red lips, thin black clothes). Is it an obligation to make it credible? I do not think so. Sara's psychology is so underdeveloped and so typical that it does not make her credible or attractive. <br /> <br /> - Terrible direction: as I said, nothing original, everything has been seen a thousand times. and it is used here for no real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny inconsistencies. For example, I do not know if the "ghost science", the "paranormal course" or what is taught in American universities ... In Europe it is not like this: teachers talk about negative energies or use sensors of "non-material" creatures . .. ridiculous. Also: how can you see a movie shot in the sixties with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without having to spend many hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie you see it immediately on the computer screen)? ) And how can he do it? This old movie, does it isolate a small detail and then increase the image and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director ever tried to digitize an old analog movie ... <br /> <br /> Eventually, "11:11" is simply worth seeing if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want Fall asleep on your couch ... But it's a costly way to sleep!
