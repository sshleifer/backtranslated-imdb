I really hate and despise this film and the filmmakers who support it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am in favor of making an honest and forceful film about youth and youth culture.1987 "River's Edge" is an excellent example. of a well-made teen drama. However, what I do not like is the childish, dirty and sensationalist approach adopted by the creators of "2:37". <br /> <br /> An excellent example is how it poses so many problems and yet fails in any meaningful aspect. A way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them. <br /> <br /> My other big problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" (surprised that Van Sant did not sue) is his attitude of 'loose bull in a porcelain shop' facing rather delicate problems such as incest and, in particular, suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this film as the plague and anything that this filmmaker is involved with later. I have heard that your motivation to do "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the poor result, this does not surprise me in the least. This is a glorified student film exercise that has no place in a movie theater or DVD. Pure and simple.
