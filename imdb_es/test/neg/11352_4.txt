"You can survive anything." Anything but a silent horror movie. The director could not even decide if he wanted a demon or just a simple serial killer. You can not have both. It's as if Michael Moore tried to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) making his own brand of "docu-comedies" charlatan: they're supposed to be very funny and funny, and yet we're also meant to treat them as documentaries based on the truth, devastating and convincing. Some genres can not be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere." (Translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense that we want). This is not so much like something "wise" found in a paper of a Chinese fortune cookie, but rather the creed of all evil horror. film director. We received this statement of nonsense from the beginning, as a preparation / justification for the foolish jester that is coming. <br /> <br /> "My phone does not work!" Well, of course it is not. There is a much greater chance that Sean Penn's brain will start functioning (after decades of catatonic apathy) than a horror movie cell phone. The saddest and most predictable horror cliché of the last decade. Why even say it? WE KNOW that the help will never come through a phone call, so it is possible that the imbeciles who make the horror do not mention it. The last 50 horror movies I saw using this plot device. It is becoming shameful. <br /> <br /> "You always have to wait for the unexpected". The final turn was quite surprising, I will give you a lot ... However, there are many nonsense on the way. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the elaborate traps that the heroine installs with the speed of a drugged man. Laboratory rat: in cold, wet and almost completely dark conditions. I love the realism of the horror movie ... <br /> <br /> When a bloodthirsty demon begins to try to be funny (by "shshshing" his victims), then you know that your pleasure to see the horror It is in doubt. The less said about the old "nutty", the better ... Another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy and uninspired director. <br /> <br /> What are the chances of being attacked by her husband and then by a demon who hates the eyes, the same day? "Expect the unexpected". It is possible that they have also been trapped in an event in which she survives a plane crash, and then in another one in which she encounters extraterrestrials who tried to probe her anally. <br /> <br /> The fast-forward button needs a Temple or sanctuary built into its image.
