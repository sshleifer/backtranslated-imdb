Stinger begins '3 Months Ago' in the SS Newark submarine, where genetic experiments have gone wrong and crew members are brutally killed by big murderous scorpions ... Jump to 'Camp Pendleton' a couple of months later, where General Ashford (James Cagnard) Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission to board the Newark and help the genetic scientist, Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), before anyone knows it, a group of corporate scientists and marines are aboard the Newark and are surprised to discover it. He mutilated the corpses of the crew other than Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) which does not make much sense. It is not long before the scorpion attack, the first to fall is Lieutenant Williams, so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and assumes the responsibility of putting everyone safe and ending the threat of the giant scorpions forever ... <br /> <br /> This Sweedish America co-production was directed by Martin Munthe, he also handled cinematography and I thought that this was a strictly uninspiring creature feature by numbers. It's the beginning of the new year and Stinger is the first giant monstrous movie / creature / insect genetically mutated that I've seen in 2007, I hope things can only get better ... The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clich√© and it shows up. ideas from other films, especially Aliens (1986), let's see that in this case the isolated place is a submarine, the team of marines gathered hastily, including one that chews a cigar throughout the film, there are scientists that include a blonde Swedish one to try and explain everything and the evil corporate villain who grabs the money and puts the mighty dollar over human life and the final ingredient is the monster / alien / insect or whatever, in this case there are lots of big scorpions running but they are not used in any unique or imaginative way so they might well have been killer grasshoppers. Yes, everything is here, unfortunately, Stinger is not an extraterrestrial if you understand what I mean. It's a long touch of more than 100 minutes and it's completely predictable, although it is moving at a reasonable pace and, as a dumb creature, it could make it worse despite what many say in the IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Director Munthe does not distinguish, it is not scary, there is a lack of atmosphere and the action scenes are boring and unattractive. There are not many scorpion attacks and it's almost an hour before a significant action takes place, the special effects are at the lower end of the scale, but I've seen worse, that's for sure. I mean it's not to say that the effects on Stinger are good, but I've seen worse. There is not much blood or blood, there are some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads and someone is broken in half. The only intelligent and funny moment in the whole movie is when the naked Swedish scientist asks her lover to turn it on talking about all the money they will earn with the scorpions ... However, there was a moment that made me moan and tearing my hair out for its stupidity when a guy tries to repair the submarine's circuits and make the lights work by hitting the computer's power supply / boards with a hammer and it also works ... <br /> <br /> Technically Stinger is average at best and there is an infinite number of dark corridors that become monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if interested. The acting was bad and there is nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a great movie and neither is it a great horror movie, I can not recommend it at all, but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger (improbable) you may like movies similar to "scorpions in freedom", Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (equally unlikely).
