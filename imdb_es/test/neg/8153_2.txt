Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value, even on the negative side of its entertainment. A friend of mine took the tape out of an overflowing linen container from St. Vincent DePaul. Well, that may be a little risky, but it was meant to be a container of clothes, not an old shitty VHS container, something that the less fortunate members of our society do not really need to improve their lives. It could be considered a mercy. Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only increase your problems. Anyway, the basic premise of a woman with a super powerful motorcycle that is armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers is not even exploited properly. The two "high-speed" pursuit sequences involve vehicles traveling at speeds below 40 KMPH and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by an old station van is not that inspiring when it comes down to that. There's only one scene where ridiculous guns are used, at the climax of the movie, and it's ridiculously ineffective, or just ridiculous, when it is. This includes laser beams that seem to be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy sword of the eighties and sorcery that produced large bursts of flames that seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets, even when they hit directly. The rest of the movie is tedious, hard to see stuffed. Many bad actors, yes, even Combs and Landau suck this, most of which seems to have been taken off the set of a porn movie stand by exchanging a really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to push the plot just coherently. There are some badly organized fighting sequences and some comic relief scenes unbearably funny with some cops and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. Comedy of the old sub Benny Hill, the hot man can not stop staring at the female carrying a variety of chests. Basically, the "money" scenes that involve the bicycle doing things are few and unconvincing and the rest is awkward filler material. Skip it.
