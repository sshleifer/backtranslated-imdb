I expected this to be of the caliber of Das Boot and to echo the rigid realism created by the acclaimed German director Leni Riefen Stahl in his documentaries, unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. The story line is unlikely and defies credulity. An aviator of the RAF is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to commit to a doctor she works with, falls in love with the aviator and makes love. The next night, in a luxurious engagement party, the aviator appears disguised as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although well directed and acted, for me it is a telenovela of the lowest order.
