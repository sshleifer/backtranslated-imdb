The name of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie would have exciting and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The sands of the desert were interesting, but this film was moving slowly to the rhythm of snails. It started well with an underground cave and something came out, but then tried to get involved with the lives of some very unpleasant human beings. When they found corpses, or should I say, skeletons with some meat, they started looking for the reason why? Sometimes something was done differently as something followed them in the desert. Some kind of black mud or something that would start eating the flesh of humans. When the meat was chewed, a bag of bones began to crawl after the remaining humans. The reason for this black mud when we found out was pretty bad, ants? Amazing! Then the end did not make sense. I suppose the motto of this movie will be: when you feel itchy and you see an ant, kill it quickly before the ant's friends smell your flesh.
