With all the potential for a good movie in its magnificent settings, cast and cinematography, the dull script, the lead rhythm and the wood performances of this film only produced great disappointment. With a good direction, editing and musical score, this could have been a good movie, maybe a dark version of Blake Edward's '10', instead of a tearful version of Ron Howard's 'Splash'.
