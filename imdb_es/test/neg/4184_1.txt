Right above the square where I'm writing now, I had to choose a number between 1 and 10, and rate this movie. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to put something. If I had my choice, I would simply not put anything, no number, because there are no digits that express the futility of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all this horribly. comments, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from attempting suicide in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released to the public, it must be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm angry because this movie was available for me to see. I feel cheated by humanity, I had no idea that humans could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler have nothing in this Cowell shower bag. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of the movie. 1) There are no scarecrows, nobody knows why there is a scarecrow of legitimate appearance in the front. 2) None of the characters in the back of the box are even in the stinky movie! 3) The phrase says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no victims killed that no one died. We do not know if the policeman of the dam died, and I assume that the killer did not die because it sounded as if he had been hit on the head with a ball bat. A favor and get away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. It's the right four, it took me an hour to see it (I quickly got past the 4-minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), I watched the television for about an hour after it ended, contemplating my life and where He was heading after seeing this shit, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know that someone out there will see this movie and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
