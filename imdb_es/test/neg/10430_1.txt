After watching the DVD release of the Blues Brothers and their mention of "Wired" in Belushi's biography, my boyfriend and I were eager to get more information about John Belushi. I had heard about "Wired", but I did not know it too much and I found it in the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really deceived in this movie and I thought it was because he did not portray them in a good way. But that had nothing to do with this. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, until they take John's body to the morgue. When he wakes up at the autopsy table, and decides to run for it, the absolute lack of taste of this film begins. John is subject to seeing his life and all the confusion he created with "Angel", a Puerto Rican taxi driver with an evil sense of humor, subjecting him to criticism and trying to try to cross it. <Br /> <br /> The two actors who represent John and Dan do not remotely resemble the real actors (let alone anyone else, that is, Lorne Michaels), which makes it really difficult to try Concentrate on them and how they were in real life ... but that's the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I think it was supposed to be an "artistic" film: John was constantly tormented by drugs (ie, soap powder in the bathroom (like cocaine), in such a way that It was also hard to follow.The flashbacks are choppy, making it difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Probably the most insipid scene was when John (literally) is forced to undergo his autopsy and feels pain while being removed the heart to weigh it., saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yes, we understand the point without the grotesque portrait. <br /> <br /> There are many other actors that we know in the movie, (? Where is Carrie Fisher for example? They were incredibly close, and Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show,) it looks very good (we felt that the graphics were from the early 80's or the end of the 70's), it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and, e In general, he did not show John's side at all. I felt I knew a little more about him when watching the episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> In a final note, Bob Woodward appears narcissist placing himself in the film, arguing with John about how to write his life. history. For someone who was supposed to be very intellectual, in relation to Nixon's bust, his caliber of person could match any writer in the National Enquirer, and therefore I would lose interest in any of his works from this point onwards. ahead. /> GO TO THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more about John, watch his movies, see Dan Akroyd's clips talking about him or hope that someone has the pleasure of making another film about John that follows the lines of "Man on the Moon", which is ultimately what we were waiting for I guess this was a "moral" movie: you know, do not use drugs, but I think the creators of this movie did not understand that his death caused several people (like Carrie Fisher) to stop doing it. Drugs in total for that reason.
