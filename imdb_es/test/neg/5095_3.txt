This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. I am about 40 years old, and I saw it with my son-in-law (20 years old) and my son (17 years). The landscape was beautiful, but the story was a failure. We saw it for about an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on my iPhone during the time we saw it in the movie. I gave it a 3 because I liked the landscape and the cinematography; otherwise, I would have given you a 1. I am sure there are people who are really interested in the "art" of all those who will find my frightening criticism, but we all have a right to our own opinions, right? I could not understand if this was supposed to be a "movie for girls" in which the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for boys, with a focus on battle and adventure. In my opinion, it was not successful either.
