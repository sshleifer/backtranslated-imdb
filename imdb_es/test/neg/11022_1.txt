I am starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if I saw the same movie as the other reviewers, but after reviewing my facts, I am forced to the sad conclusion that I have. <br /> <br /> This Wannabee nonsense comedy has to be one of the longest 94 minutes I've spent, and one of the least fun things I've ever seen in my life. Now, do not get me wrong, I love comedies, but this boring nonsense is far from the dizzy heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that does not deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of at the same time as those big ones. The dialogue of writer / director Charles Martin is neither witty, subtle nor interesting, and there is a lot of that. Nor does he know how to finish a scene, with a relentless cut, especially of people who leave the rooms and say goodbye to each other, the pace of the film would have risen and the fact that the limited number of characters is doing stupidities. and things without reason for no other reason, a comedy was supposed to have been a little less obvious. The characters in this film fall in love and fall in love with each other, and move in and out of the apartments, at a given moment, only to move the small plot forward. At one point people desperately crave one person, and the next they are going to marry another person: they have courted and courted off the screen so we do not know anything until one of the characters says: "Oh , they will get married! "(usually after someone has made a false step or has jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we had known that these two characters were in love or were supposed to be engaged in advance, we, the audience, could have enjoyed the experience of seeing someone making a fool of themselves in front of them. As they are, the characters simply look like selfish and petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action is limited to them in a way that makes everything possible. It seems a poorly filmed play. The only moments of relief from boredom are Keenan Wynn, who seems to have entered a different movie and has decided to stay and be a little more fun than all the fun things that happen around him. <br /> <br /> Highly avoidable.
