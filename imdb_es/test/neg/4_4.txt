Unfortunately, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Credible performances, but the script had nowhere to go and was in no hurry to get there. First, we are offered a series of unrelated events, some of which expand the story. Will the script focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? What about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, a true story is not developed in front and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, over and over again. Finally, long after you no longer care, you will learn something about script meetings. No doubt three endings were offered and nobody could make a decision. The end resulted? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can pass the last number 100 yawn, you can eliminate them. Despite the transparent attempt to earn points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, it should have been washed the first day.
