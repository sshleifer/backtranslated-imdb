I heard legends about this "movie" (quotes that are used to not insult movies) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with him, I started to see him impatiently. In the end, * I * had * to move fast through some of the most absurd, absurd and senseless scenes of this mindless childish disorder to make it end faster. <br /> <br /> This may be the worst movie I've even "touched", and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. "Manson Family" makes the lower part of Troma tickets look like a bold and innovative art work in an art house. I could continue and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" that has, the "acting" disgustingly bad, the "direction" painful and inept, the sets and accessories with its "ninety-nine dollar" appearance (I especially loved it "The plastic toy guns used in the scene of Tate's murder!" Or the nauseating aspect of this whole garbage bag (I think it was supposed to represent a drug-induced hallucination, I have no idea how a hallucination drug-induced looks or feels, nor do I want to find out, but I think the burned-out "brains" junkies will love this "movie" (they seem to be the ones who made it) I've seen many films of several "Worst Lists of 50", traditionally Eddie Wood, and Eddie Wood would be horrified by the sheer ineptitude and talent of van Webber (or whatever it's called, I do not want to remind him) "I had never seen" Superbabies "or its sequel, but I firmly wish that "Manson" joined them in the IMDb rating. Fortunately, this dark garbage p Robably will not be seen by enough spectators to justify it with enough "1" votes, and much better!
