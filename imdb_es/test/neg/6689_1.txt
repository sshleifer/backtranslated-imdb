This was terrible, mean and full of the worst clich√©s and racial stereotypes I've seen in a long time. Seeing Hayden P trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hello, one pants up in his sweat and some braids down does not make you "down with friends"). Solange Knowles grimaces throughout the entire movie. Most sequences of sets seem to have been recorded in cardboard boxes ... What happened to the end? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to make people see her "act", which she can not. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this Downs't movie deserves a star. Please, put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the following Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
