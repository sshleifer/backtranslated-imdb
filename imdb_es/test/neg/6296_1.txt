I saw this in the cinema during its initial release and I can only ask "Has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind-boggling for this poorly written and shamefully predictable clap trap. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a genius filmmaker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since then (see 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder') <br /> <br /> I can only assume that making a film about the gay / transsexual culture has people who assume that not liking the film is an offense for this sector of the population. Are not we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Ok, the 3 tracks do it well, considering what they have to work with, but this movie includes the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, without the help of a heinous dialogue and a really scant resolution that you can see a mile away. <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing movie and it does not deserve the exaggerated reputation it has won.
