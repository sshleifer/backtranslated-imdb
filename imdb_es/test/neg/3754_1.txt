Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first, the premise tickled me. After all, if you were a teenager in Reagan's age, a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'em Sock' em Robots? I loved them, not * despite * the fact that they were stupid, but * because * they were stupid and funny. But when VH1 decided to do the series "I Love Last Tuesday", I knew that enough was enough. The Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter. How stupid are Slinkys? (Wait, let me see ... hmmm, no, no, it seems that it does not). The posture of snarky, brat and super hip has its place, but that's enough!
