Well, I fell in love with that. I saw the box for this in the video store and confused it with "Girlfight", what I had heard was great. In my own defense, the titles are similar, and they made the cover of the box again so that it looked almost identical. Anyway, to summarize, it is obvious that they reissued the whole package / promotion of the cover to take advantage of the success / success of "Girlfight". I introduced it and I had a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget movies directly to the video, and even worse when a music video of the main song of the movie, which sounded like elevator music and had some videos of Slome Slomo . The movie preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew that I had fallen in love. (Do not get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but I knew she was not in "Girlfight," the movie she had the false impression that she was renting). <br /> <br /> Then, aside from feeling cheated and angry with myself for not looking more closely, the movie was fine. The plot involves Belle, a young Latina who is the daughter of a former boxing champion. One of her closest friends is a boxer, who, and I could see that all this was coming well ahead of what was really a burden, is seriously injured during a game with a middle champion called "The Terminator", which looks like to a female version of a bigger and more pumped Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that all she has to do is become a boxer and take revenge on her friend. She lives with her caring, supportive but protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who happens to be a policeman. His love interest, also loving and caring but protective, is also a policeman who works with his father. Hmmm, both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the performance of their duty ... do you wonder what will happen? She starts training and meets a poor quality manager who, of course, pretends to care about her, but only wants to exploit her. The actor they hired looks like a very low income Cary Eweles and is so young that he barely manages to have a mustache. His performance was also very, very bad. I'm not even going to continue with the plot because anyone who has seen Rocky, or almost anyone, knows exactly where this film is going and how it will end. <br /> <br /> This was not a completely terrible movie. Most of the acting was good, and the main actress was very good. There were good and strong female Latin models. The final scene of the fight made me interested, although I knew everything that was going to happen long before it happened. The actress who played "The Terminator" did a great job at being so unpleasant that she really wanted Belle to give her a $$, and she looked at Belle again, although there were no surprises at all. My favorite moment (maybe the only time I was not mad at myself for having rented the movie by mistake) was when Belle slaps her evil manager after she shows him his true colors, shouts at him and then turns around to fake a Beat it and watch it fall back in fear, proving that she is the one in charge. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was very, very bad, my main complaint. One of his attempts to be witty was when someone was discussing boxing saying "size does not matter" and the woman responding ironically, "now where did I hear that before?" Other lines that are supposed to have a dramatic impact are: "The doctors told me that I may never walk again!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you." I could go on and on. Nothing you have not heard a million times before in soap operas or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too bad: the filmmakers made an effort, and I voluntarily sat through the whole thing ... but only because there was nothing more to do while I was exercising. It could make it worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters) but you could also do it much, much better.
