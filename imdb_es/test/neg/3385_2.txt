Wow, where do I start? After suffering this unfortunate rent of $ 1.00 (thank you very much, family video) I just had to make some comments. I did not bother writing the names of the 3 actors in the movie, but I hope you know who I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster truck terrifies the field and chases two college-age friends to their doom. They meet a hot girl with horny clothes. I mean, this just sounds fantastic in theory. I laughed hysterically in the DVD box as I walked towards the girl behind the counter in the video store. <br /> <br /> Acting: the hot girl, played by Aimee Whatever, visibly laughs through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared The other two main actors in the movie, the fat joker and the straight guy vanilla are terrible. The fat one thinks it's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, emulates too much and misses all his signals and introduces himself as a generic character that you can see in a movie made for Nickelodeon about skateboarding in the early 90's. Look: I do not expect great performances in films like these, but at least the actors can make an effort not to be annoying. You can be an incompetent actor, but still be nice (ie, John Wayne). At least that girl from Aimee is attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy ****, who thought this dialogue was fun? I would not have the nerve to play this in front of my school drama class, much less cast it like a movie script. Unfortunately bad More on this later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the movie is definitely successful. The production quality is surprisingly high. The appearance of the movie is very good. Apparently, the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> Well, here are my biggest complaints: 1) The guy who drives the car never drives more than 25 miles per hour. <Br /> <br /> 2) The guy who drives the car is in the country before realizing that there is a fat man with a mask in the back seat. He's supposed to be meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his old car in good condition, but do not you see a 300-pound Jack Black impersonator in the back? Let's go. <br /> <br /> 4) The characters never change their clothes. There are two hotel scenes. Presumably, the showers are available for our characters but during the 3 days in which this movie takes place, none of the characters bothers to change their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. The cheerful, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. Period. You can not let our characters flee a monster truck for a second and the next second they verbally confront each other with some light / comedy music. This type of rhythm virtually ruins any tension in the movie. Movies like Evil Dead 2, which mix comedy and horror, understand that tension can be loosened but never completely removed with humor. Monster Man does not understand it. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that what could have been a VERY funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was much smarter than he really was. Oh good.
