I totally disgusted this unnecessary sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure," a movie about which I made a great comment. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing because of the word GO! I agree, why were not there other rescue boats and helicopters around? The one who rescued the original survivors had just overflew the ship in which Michael Caine and Sally Field are. WHAT WAS THE ONLY TREATMENT OF RESCUE? It's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally bad and the show seems cheap. I really hated the loss of talent of some good actors. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie unless you should see Sally and Michael as lovers. <br /> <br /> gord
