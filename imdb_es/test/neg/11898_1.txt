I was surprised after seeing this piece of junk, if you've seen an episode of TOM and JERRY in which Jerry pours some liquid on him and becomes invisible from what is likely to see the same cartoons with added EROTIC, beating a man who becomes invisible and does. S * i * is the conclusion of the movie. Involving too much sex in a cartoon-themed movie does not increase its value :(, and most of all I was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show the Mr.Invisible and that was really horrible, I must say, the flour falls off the shelf and our own Mr.Invisible becomes visible "Look at ZACK and MIRI to make a porn movie" I bet you will not get bored, <br /> <br /> 1/10 from me
