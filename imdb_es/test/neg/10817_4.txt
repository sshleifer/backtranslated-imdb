Some scientific people go down to a cave for some reason and there is some kind of creature that is killing them. <br /> <br /> Usually, I give a more detailed plan, but I was not paying too much attention to this. In general, it was boring and the only time he will pay attention is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, but the characters are so boring and forgettable. They mix in your mind. It will forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. The murders are boring 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The ending could have surprised me more if I knew who was who. <Br /> <br /> So you're looking for a movie of creatures in the cave? Take a look at The Descent instead.
