I'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even B movies. I routinely watch some B movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good to downright awful. Usually, my expectations are very low before I see this kind of movies, and even after doing that, Descent was downright horrible. I did not really care that they were cheating the Core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are concerned about the seismic activity of the earth and must travel to the depths of the earth to stabilize the mantle. So, what we get is a monotonously long setup in which two dueling scientists played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts have to work together on a secret mission, called Project DEEP. The man in charge, General Fielding played by Michael Dorn, is secretly hiding vital information from Assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist who created the "Mole", a drill used to submerge in the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> Apart from some pretty good special effects, and set design, nothing of Descent is worth it. The film starts quite entertaining, but quickly gets stuck in a boring story about uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been killed in other films like Core. Descent also has a poor script, with a useless and easy to forget dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no threat or real danger. The attempts at comic relief are painfully unfair. The plot has open holes and some of the subplots are left untied at the end, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> When closing this movie, it was just a cheap way for everyone involved to receive a paycheck. There was no thought behind this movie, there's no innovation, it's just there. Apart from some nice special effects and special designs, this movie fails at all other levels. The story is from the Hollywood trash can, and the characters are not interesting to boot. The descent will simply bring you down to boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
