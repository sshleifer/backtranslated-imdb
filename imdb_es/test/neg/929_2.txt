Is this an FMV game or a movie? In all honesty, I observed this from "the election without less". It is a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It seems that the HK films go in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to see, instead of something we want us to see. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so horrible that they seemed like something from the low resolution games of the early to mid-90s (compared to today). <br /> <br /> The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander game, that is, the third installment in the series. Stop going back and let the Asians see us so badly in this compared to the big Hollywood guns. <br /> <br /> Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest stories, myths and legends, the best technophiles and, possibly, the largest graphic computing talent base in the world! So, what went very, very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many movies? Please, stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK films are heading downhill so quickly. Did not you say being the Hollywood of the East? I suppose not.
