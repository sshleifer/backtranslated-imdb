Yes, this movie features a girl named Jessica who says that everything is bad and that also makes trees sit on people (well, it only causes a tree to fall once, but says everything is bad). This film is about a farm that apparently rents rooms to people, but offers little more in terms of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and finds the head of an evil guy. Of course, they do not know it until the owner of the farm helpers opens the box containing the head. The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can to reach Jessica and use her powers to find things that help her search for her body. This movie has a pretty interesting story, but it plays very badly here. Everyone in this movie will make you nervous at least once.
