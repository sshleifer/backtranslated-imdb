Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and I have read Steal this book and Steal this urine test. I'm also an even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a lot of trash that made a PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director did not risk that Abbie Hoffman was interested in this movie. They despised Stew Albert as a caricatured chihuahua unintelligent, the man was a professor at Berkley for Christianity. Ok, they did an awful casting job for Anita Hoffman, they did a horrible job for Jerry Rubin's character. I guess the movie does not fit the breaking news I've seen of Abbie or the books he wrote. The movie just did not fit and it bothered me. Oh, yes, and Theat is the absolute worst voice I've heard from Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies that I have rented that I could not see completely because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and her discreet band of Yippies and this movie was just poorly made. And it hurts me that now, when people see a movie about yippies, they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. Instead, they get a hollywoodized garbage palantry. <br /> <br />
