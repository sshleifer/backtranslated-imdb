This movie was terrible. It is not something that people have to pay to see. It seems that some Christian group did it to convert people. I do not understand why it was released to theaters and not to television. <br /> <br /> It started as a science fiction movie from the 1950s, but it was quickly changed. At 30 minutes into the movie, the characters begin to talk about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It moves quickly to territory of pure religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a science fiction movie. The movie has a bad performance; bad camera angles and is amateur. <br /> <br /> AVOID IT!
