"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, which is already the subject of the movie "The General" by John Boorman in 1998. Cahill had a rude education in a slum area and graduated from misdemeanor to robbery at hand armed with honors. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor past at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals who conveniently overlook the thousands of slum dwellers who are not busy stealing post offices and selling weapons to make ends meet. Cahill made a fool of the police and the local authorities, without mentioning the IRA, which earned him a kind of "popular hero" and made many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral and selfish thief. <br /> <br /> My main problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is made to be an adorable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job representing Michael Lynch with a mixture of oily charm and silent threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The film is well filmed and well acted by a fine cast, but what fails is the script. The writer Gerard Stembridge can not decide; Are you writing an Irish "Lock Stock" or a more rude treatment to Martin Cahill's thieves career? That is the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed the cinematic release of "The General" by John Boorman, which was a more accurate portrait of the story of Martin Cahill. Cahill was an astute thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits were treated to the film. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing is that a studio was prepared to take the story of Cahill and give him an idea. Happy ending in Hollywood style. Michael Lynch, the charismatic, great thief, thief, charismatic Kevin Spacey, gets anonymity on his motorcycle in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, only to show that no one drives a paramilitary, antiquarian, corrupt and antiquated organization crazy, and gets away with it. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never have strayed from his notoriety because it reinforced his self-image of "The Man of the People." Making Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is an end to a shallow and superficial film.
