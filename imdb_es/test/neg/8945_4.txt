A few years ago, this film had been scheduled for broadcast at TCM UK as part of a retrospective of Tod Browning. But what they really showed was the 1937 remake! my brother had seen it (and, in retrospect, he followed the rather original scene, even to the stage design). Although it is not a classic, he said it was a much more satisfying visual experience than the previous version, incredibly creaky. <br /> <br /> Being this the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had high hopes for it. but when it became evident after the first conversation of the tedious conversation, it was ignored that the main concern of the film was to appease the still novel sound technique and, consequently, the result is scenic and extremely static. The plot of the thriller is not exactly exciting either; even less palatable is the ostensible British-Indian environment (with the affected accents of the characters and the behavior of the upper class, not to mention the excessive use of idiosyncratic idioms such as "I say", "rather" and "now look here" "Making everything laughable more than anything else! <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there are some involuntary howlers: Margaret Wycherly (as a false medium) pleads with Lugosi Police Inspector (in any case, his undeniable presence on the screen is already evident) to give him some time to "find out" who is really the culprit of the double murder (the evidence points to his own daughter, played by Leila Hyams!)? she hears a tapping and he tricks himself into thinking that the spiritual world has actually made contact with her, but then Lugosi enters the room and, in his unmistakable accent, says to his face: "I played twice", you did not listen. what my brother and I almost fell for I floor in convulsions of laughter! The editing is also really sloppy: during a high-angle shot of the main set, is a microphone that is rapidly withdrawing from the camera's range? and what is worse, there are a couple of cases in which a person leaves the screen, apparently in the next shot, to another part of the set, but each shot is carried out on the other actors for an absurdly long time, So it seems to take an eternity for this person to walk a few steps! <br /> <br /> THE THIRTY-PRESIDENT marks the third Browning Talkie without horror I've seen? even if both this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) are about murder and occultism and, therefore, could be linked to gender. Much has been said about the apparent loosening of the director with the arrival of Sound: however, although they may be deficient, the 4 horror films he made throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the others. Have you always found me quirky and elegant enough to suggest that Browning was not as at sea during this period as has been suggested?
