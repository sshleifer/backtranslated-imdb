This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of due to the good reviews that some of them received here is that they were written by people from the cast. It was really painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to see it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and saying, "Hey, let's make a movie, who wants to be in it?" It's so bad. Besides Luke Perry, who is alone in a small part of the movie, I did not recognize any other actor. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot (I) and I generally like stupid and dumb movies, but this movie does not have a single redemption quality. The people who wrote it have no idea how children think, speak or act, and the film is a disconnected mess of terribly cheesy lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've seen since Man's Best Friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've seen in my life. If you rent it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people rate this movie as good is a sad comment about their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
