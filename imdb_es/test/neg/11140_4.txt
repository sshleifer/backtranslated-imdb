Yes, it is pure garbage. It can be interesting for all those who like experimental cinema (like me) to see the bass players babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize that you really paid for this. Probably, this is one of those movies that you love to see for its complete emptiness and nihilism. Although I accept it for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
