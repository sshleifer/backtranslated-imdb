I can not forget how horrible this movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible soundtrack of a song. There are four children and a dog that flee from a hospital and then escape stealing two cars and a bus. Nobody gives them any punishment or anything to correct them. The acting is so horrible that it sounds like an instructional video for social studies class. I can not think of one thing I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the child who lost his dog made me want to vomit. Retrieve your dog without the lady seeing the dog running out the door. Maybe the dog was trying to escape from this movie. Then there is a bit of manure in the whole mix. It was torture to watch this movie. Then, in the end, the older child says that something like staying together is not a crime and everyone embraces and loves it. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and I should have gone to the children's lounge or something like that. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
