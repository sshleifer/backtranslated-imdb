As in the previous poster, I burned with the title thinking that I was getting the other Piranha ... This movie is everything the previous poster said and worse ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, bad interpretation and very simple horrible story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here that was worth seeing ... How this movie, even released, surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... and it is not. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was labeled "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" which is what it really is ... This is the only way they sold this movie. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
