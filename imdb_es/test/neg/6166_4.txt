Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, Killshot suffers from a lack of focus, direction and creativity. all the elements that probably had the original story and the negative detection tests forced to make severe editions (including the complete extinction of a character) that resulted in a film that almost does not look like a Leonard story. Too many characters populate a story too simplistic and direct (not a typical feature of the work of the author) and the focus changes continuously between two sicarios who are difficult to like and a couple with problems that do not dominate our sympathy. While the story itself provides very few twists and turns, unfortunately by the end of the film, its appeal remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> Armand hit man "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently corrupts his latest work. Now, running away from his former employer, he joins the forces with the inept maladjusted criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to earn some quick cash by extorting a wealthy real estate agent. When the couple fighting Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are aware of the wrong plot of the thieves, they are forced to hide because the crazed murderers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot proves that relying on a novel by Elmore Leonard is no reason for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, the situations and even the resolutions in the film are tired and unoriginal, and only allude to chance to something else. Was not there no potential, especially when Rourke's killer dressed in black, quiet and collected perfectly executed a blow during the opening scene? Purpose and principles are simply abandoned continually as each minute passes. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; visually, the roles of Bird and even Wayne are properly shaped, giving an immediate and deep interest to people who usually end up in a creative impasse. <br /> <br /> The pairing of cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive. Richie is an attractive combination (the comparisons with Fargo would be extravagantly too kind), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting. When Richie begins to grasp the habits of the most experienced killer, Bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. Regardless of what you see in your momentary joyful adventure with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that your final confrontation with Carmen's panic would provoke a confession of her true nature and the subsequent neglect that drastically affects her result. Probably or not, this is the unfortunate fall of Killshot. and these characters can get little entertainment, losing their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing. <br /> <br /> - The twins of Massie
