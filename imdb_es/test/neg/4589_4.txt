Another horrible movie about hockey. If I never saw hockey and saw the Hollywood version, I would hate the game. This movie also does not make Canada look so good. I can laugh at that and not take it too seriously. Anyway, this movie is horrible, with everything you can put in an 80s movie. In the end you do not even see it on TV. 4/10
