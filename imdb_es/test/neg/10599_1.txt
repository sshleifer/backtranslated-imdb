I heard what people said, but I ignored them. Being rushed on Blockbuster, I took a copy of this movie and ran. <br /> <br /> In the 45th minute I was struggling to stay awake. There is an attempt to keep the movie interesting, but it was just bad. A chase of some kind is carried out, but it was long and long, the perfect time to make a snack. By the time this movie was over, I did not care how it ended, I just wanted it to end. Going in and out of my room to see if it was over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√©, the characters and their relationships. The twists of the plot are predictable, as well as the ending. The actors made the best of the really terrible roles. All I can say is: her clothes were pretty, but the movie was just bad.
