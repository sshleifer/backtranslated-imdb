If you've ever heard any of James Lee Burke's books on a tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native of Texas (or so I've heard) and no one plays a Texan who is BETTER, but he's not a Cajun. Your delivery is wrong. I lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange pattern that contains the Louisiana accent. TLJ does not have any of that. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be chosen for this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? ). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that the movie only had a 4, the plot collapsed like a fish out of water and did not have the usual interest, but not the linear continuity that the book usually has. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We could see some of the best JLB villains.
