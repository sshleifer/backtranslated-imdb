From what I understand, Fox was ashamed that they released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received in any way. <br /> <br /> I was not sure where to go next, since they believed that Anderson was the best director of the franchise and had produced a true science fiction gem, Fox became. It is a group of monkeys with knowledge, but with knowledge to get answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were by no means veterans of science fiction movie writing, but had seen the remake of Burton's Planet of the Apes and the House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Your first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen television actors soon after. <br /> <br /> Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more than the budget, so they wrote the film themselves. Leaving aside important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking about new lines so that the audience in general remembered years on the line, that was more difficult. They defeated the heads for a while and created a truly award-winning script, equipped with clich√© characters, idiotic decisions and gaps in the plot. <br /> <br /> Fox was satisfied with the results so far, but I wanted to see what he would become. From the centerpieces to the movie - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to destroy the great robotics used in the original AvP, which would otherwise be terrible, and go with the Alien man-in-the-suit seen in the old movies . The actors who played the aliens had problems adapting to the costumes, since the monkeys did not have the right size, so they shook their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided that a predator was enough this time (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that apparently come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> But, what about the effects, questions? Come on people. They may be cute but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the movie. Without getting into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very good fire and spark effects. Putting red and green filters on the camera lens provided excellent Predator views. <br /> <br /> The stage was something that the monkeys thought long and hard. If this was going to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This is where they admitted that they could have made a mistake. Look, the monkeys did not have the proper training in this department, so they thought that turning off the lights in the city and making the film take place in the middle of the night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They just forgot that people like to see creatures instead of watching the shadows and raining the whole movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the incredibly close fighting scenes so no one could see what they were fighting or who they were. But again, novice error. <br /> <br /> The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the film with an R rating. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually occurred, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the spectators obtained the blood they wanted and the monkeys did not have to film most of the action shots related to the violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors originally had questions about the script. Why a blue liquid that the Predator has infinite amounts of magical disintegration whatever he wants and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-con driving the whole movie in a police car? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full-body photo of the Aliens? Why does a watch play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions continued to grow, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was delighted with her work. So excited they opened the movie across the country on Christmas Day and even spent a few dollars advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another delivery in these beloved franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask, what happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use? They put it in their next movie: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan They knew that the general public would be upset with the title, but since then they have published this statement: <br /> <br /> "For the people, do not worry about our next film, it will have an R rating and it will have violence. "<br /> <br /> And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
