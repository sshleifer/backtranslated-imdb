They scammed me seriously with this purchase. The other posters cover quite well the faults of this poor poor movie. My DVD that I actually bought had the Piranha poster from 1978 on the cover with the credits from that film on the front 'Directed by Joe Dante', etc. I was very disappointed to find the wrong movie on the album. Actually I am a fan of many bad movies. There is always something funny or at least fun in most of them somewhere. Not this movie! In fact, I'm going to spend the three dollars on gasoline to return this two-dollar DVD just for the beginning. Brazen false packaging here. Easily the worst movie of all time. There are no redemption factors at all. NORTH !!! It's not even worth checking out to see how bad it is. Seriously.
