Young couple on the road, taking care of their own affairs and having casual sex in their car during daylight. However, suddenly, they are being threatened and terrorized by a psychopath in an old and rusty truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yes, now I remember we've seen this a thousand thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than "Rest Stop"! This new film, weak and lamentable, is an insult even for the intellect of the most demanding horror fans, since it does not present a single original twist or a memorable trick. It is very sadistic and unpleasant, but all teen movies are sadistic and unpleasant nowadays, so that is no longer a real surprise. The main absolute problem with this production is the unbelievably large number of silly plot holes and nonsense subplots. Screenwriter and director John Shiban realized very well that the basic ultra-thin plot was not nearly enough to fill an entire movie, and so he fills his film like a Thanksgiving turkey with stupid, mindless stuffing material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears in an abandoned and dirty rest stop in California. Killing your character immediately would not result in a very long movie and, therefore, later you will find a family of mobile home fans, suffers from visions (?) In which you talk to the previous victims of the crazy killer and have a deep boring emotion) conversations with a police officer who simply will not die even though a truck ran over him ... twice! Subaltern dumb frames never lead anywhere and are definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch the length of a movie I've seen. Instead of all the useless stuffing, Shiban should have paid more attention to increasing the tension and making his main characters a little more pleasant. The character of Jaimie Alexander, Nicole, is an annoying and brainless girl, and you really will not care if she will survive the ordeal or not. Her boyfriend Jesse, as well as the policeman, are whining losers and their brutal deaths were still not painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including gratuitous torture and mutilation, which were bloody and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile on my face. That's too little for a horror movie today. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to capitalize on the success of movies like "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel," but it's better to see the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They are promoting themselves as the new name with great horror, but they will have to find something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe that.
