There's really only one reason to see this film barely adequate and absolutely predictable about a tense chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphan niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister died in a car accident . And that's the reason to see Aaron Eckhart (Nick), who, with his flexible haircut and attractive woman's attitude, looks well enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with olive oil and Balsamic vinaigrette and a few dice finely cut in the sun tomatoes reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he could take off his shirt really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He took off his apron petulantly several times, but, to my disappointment, he never went any further. <br /> <br /> I can not be too critical because I was watching it at Pay Per View at home, so it did not cost me anything. At least the price of two tickets for the cinema, and I was educated to thank the small mercies. But in reality, this is Rom Com in its most formulable form. Zeta Jones offers a monotonous and very flat performance, which seemed to lack passion (possibly due to the amount of time that apparently was spent in the restaurant's cold store? Thirty takes could not have been fun) and her face The expression hardly changed as throughout the entire movie. Abigail Breslin was very good as the niece, she is such an attractive girl that it is impossible to criticize her, and anyway she wanted her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson always has a good value for money and I really can not criticize her performance as owner of the restaurant, because she seemed very undervalued, given that she is a good actress and what little she had to do here. But all this is so clich√©, much of the banal dialogue and the result so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of painting by numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick likes Italian food (no doubt indicates his inner passion) and cooks to the sound of Puccini. Her appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the name of the restaurant) supposedly ruffles her feathers, but her strange ability to bond with her niece cooking pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room, makes Kate accompany her and, despite some hiccups along So, she ends up giving him her prized possession. No, not his honor. But his recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm being very unfair here, right? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we're getting into when we sign up. But does the mind always have to be so boring?
