Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. Yesterday I only saw "Golden Temple Amazons" and I no longer have the slightest recollection of what happened in this movie. That's how brilliant this movie is, I suppose! For now I only remember being attracted to see it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover, which shows a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon who prepares her bow to shoot an unspecified target. I am often deceived by the attractive DVD covers? especially those of Jess Franco? and I still have not learned to resist, even after hundreds of terrible experiences. Oh good?? After reading the other comments from the users, some parts of my memory came back although I still suspect to confuse this movie with another masterpiece by Jess Franco that I saw the previous day, namely, "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" (and, yes, that had an amazing DVD cover too). <br /> <br /> Does "Golden Temple Amazons" open with a gang of white African Amazons? I am aware of the contradiction but do not blame me? massacring the parents of a frail young girl because they were invading the territory with the intention of stealing the gold treasures of the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get revenge. She is accompanied by a group of poor quality adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but who would not mind taking a little gold home. The rudimentary premise is, obviously, secondary to all the exhibitions of dazzling female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon and the other anonymous Amazons are all the usual options of Franco and voluntarily walk with their breasts proudly exposed. It is better that you enjoy contemplating all these perfect feminine curves, since the rest of "Golden Temple Amazons" is a boring and incompetent disaster. There is almost no violence or action, and not less than half of the film is full filler, fragments and pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited in history and that kind of thing. The impressive DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box does not make any sense.
