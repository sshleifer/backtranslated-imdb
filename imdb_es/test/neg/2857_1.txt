I have never seen a B movie like this ... on the side of Nanny Sof√≠a's death ... a hand of a woman appears on the tape that handles the stick ... how bad is that? LOL, I laughed seriously and I wanted to stop watching the movie, but I kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... it's bad for itself ... poor Pinocchio ... the only good thing is The first time you see some special effects of the movement of Pinocchio's face ... apart from that, the whole movie is horrible ... it's not worth spending time if you really do not have much to spare! But if you have nothing to do ... continue ... give yourself a movie "Z" because the movie B is still too good for this ... LOL
