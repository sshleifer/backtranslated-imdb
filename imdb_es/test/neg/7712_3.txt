Is not it strange that fucking movies are always a little better when you start to see them with an attitude like: "boy, is this going to suck more than what few things have sucked before"? Is it almost impossible for someone to rent this movie with high? or even remotely positive: expectations, since "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered one of the worst gender disasters ever launched. The abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director Michael Hurst, as it was really easy to exceed the level of quality of his predecessor. And exactly how embarrassing this must be for Uwe Boll, huh? Need to recognize that a direct sequel to video without the power of stars or promotional campaigns is MUCH better than your own pretentious interpretation of video games? In case someone still has doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie, but YES: it's definitely better than the first and it's even worth renting in case you're looking a little demanding. film peppered with a lot of bloody, sordid killings and stupid humor. There is no real connection to the events in the first movie (another advantage) and this second part opens up as a typically rancid sexual comedy on a university campus. The male fraternity club plans to attack a sisterhood house, inhabited exclusively by blond monkeys with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when an insane teacher (Sid Haig!) Passes his car over a girl and takes her back to her lab she in a zombie. This is the beginning of a deadly and rapidly spreading epidemic, but do not worry, as the government is ready and sends its best scientists and soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and retrieve blood samples for an antidote. The hunting of zombies seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squad, even called Hyper Sapiens, but their increasing amount endangers the lives of the hardened soldiers. Hurst director, fortunately, found his inspiration in the most prominent classics of the genre, such as "Aliens" by James Cameron and ?? of course - the dead trilogy of George A. Romero, particularly "Day of the Dead". Fortunately, he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who inserted images from the video game into his film (why ?!) and * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as chopped corpses and detailed amputations, but in reality it never becomes nauseating or shocking. Naturally, there is not the slightest suspense to enjoy and every terrible horror clich√© is also presented here. The movie is very pleasant as long as story writer Mark Altman does not try to explain the origins of zombie epidemics. They are walking corpses with their brains hanging from their skulls, so we really do not need to know what caused their death. Especially not when explanations are given by a blonde bitch who clearly has no idea what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid being bitten, honey.
