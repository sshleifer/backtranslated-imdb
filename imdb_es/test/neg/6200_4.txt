I was really prepared to see when two of the best movie critics called this movie a "riot of laughter". But the movie turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be recommended to watch this movie while keeping your brains at home, but you simply can not ignore the flaws and shortcomings. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked very bad. (He's 49 years old and he's only 24 ... more than double his age) 3. Salman's comedy is less about acting and more about overacting. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good but they interrupt the rhythm of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. The filmmakers deliberately tried some scenes to make them fun, and 6. A poor and flawed story. <br /> <br /> However, there are few advantages: 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. Appearance and acting continue to improve with each movie. <br /> <br /> 4. The Don sequences of Rajpal Yadav. Although underutilized but hilarious. <br /> <br /> Then 4 good points, 6 bad ones ... this one gets 4/10.
