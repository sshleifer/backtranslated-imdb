Since I bought the DVD, I watched it as much as I did because of a sense of obligation with my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications occur. <br /> <br /> Douglas is generally considered an intense actor, given to very dramatic roles, sometimes a hero, sometimes a rat. It's not bad in this funny part. The problem is that the part is not particularly funny and nothing else. <br /> <br /> The plot continues. A dozen "extravagant" characters come and go, mainly Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make ironic comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still have been rescued by some spark in the dialogue, but there's nothing to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not clean that bar. This is what I thought of as a funny line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to take her to the beach house and seduce her. The day is disturbed and he says he has never heard of a writer who works in a house on the beach. Wynn asks if he liked Douglas' previous book, "Last year's love." Yes, of course he did. "Well, most of 'Last year's love' was made at the beach house." LOL. <br /> <br /> Good cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better comedies on television.
