This film, although it could be considered a good comedy attempt, is not what the previous ones achieved. the first half is composed of the typical robin Williams standing up, although he did not really make many voices; he was always good in the first lines and in the ticks ... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program used in the election. this is where Network 3 comes into play ... a woman who helped with this program wants to be told the truth and the evil corporation wants to silence her ** the spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them, although this is not enough developed. .. this movie could have been one of political brilliance (maybe with sorken in the reigns) but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs
