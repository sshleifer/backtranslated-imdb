I give this movie 2 stars just for its slightly liberal plot. Without going into too many details. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible. Really terrible: wooden, shallow. <br /> <br /> The graffiti shown is weak, so bloody that I can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti at all. It was obvious in the spraying scenes that had gotten other people to do the 'work'. They could have let the actors do the painting and save a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> The crazy kid soundtrack used to be Something I heard on my iPod, it will be a while before I can go back there for fear that this movie will come back to my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. Unless you're thinking to yourself "Wow, it's been a while since I saw a fucking movie ..."
