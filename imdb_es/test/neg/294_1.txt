I'm not going to bother mentioning any of the arguments: this is strictly a B movie on its way to darkness. The shock to me, however, is to see what has happened to some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, anyway, would never call a theater actor, seems to have transformed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He has always been one of my favorites because of his martial arts skills, as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies, but if you like martial arts, you can see them). Here, he's a shell of his old self, he's older, but he's doing something mercenary and he does not even seem interested ... I just do not understand. Do not these people invest? William Forsythe is another "heavy" that I've always liked, but his last roles are what he would call "send it by mail". I'm not even going to mention Mr. Reynolds: his performance here amounts to a shot, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual, a creepy villain, evil and with a voice of sandpaper that can curdle milk, the best! This is a movie you see to laugh. There is nothing more than that.
