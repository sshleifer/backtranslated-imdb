Before sitting down and watching this movie on HBO, I expected nothing more than a few laughs here and there and, all together, a stupid and common plot. Well, that's exactly what I got, except that I was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. I did not expect it to be, I thought it was only going to be another hour and a half that I had in my hands to waste. Well, it was, but it was still worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, it acted cheaply and some of the lines were very silly. Apart from that, I still had fun times, although there are not many. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are renting this, do not do it. Watch it on television. I gave him a 4, I was generous because he made me laugh, but still he was pretty stupid.
