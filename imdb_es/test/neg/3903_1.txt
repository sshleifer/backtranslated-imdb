The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan in it! My God, that was the most boring and pointless movie I've ever seen! THAT SHAMEFUL!!! I mean really, give me a break! After Voyager, I hope they offer you better roles! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I would NOT continue living in a travel trailer in dessert! This is such a bad movie! The thing about the Indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really, really aged. Poor Jeri, better luck next time!
