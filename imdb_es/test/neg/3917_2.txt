Dennis Hopper must have been really anxious to make this movie. Atrocious special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid-looking bio-robot killers. It does not matter the blatant disregard for science. The uncomfortable scene with the 2 young drivers taking off their clothes. The best part of this movie was the cybernetic penis in the capricious cybernetic pirate. 2 out of 10 stars because I'm in a good mood.
