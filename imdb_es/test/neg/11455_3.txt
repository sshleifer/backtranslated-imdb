Cimarron was painful when sitting. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with the hard-hand script, the pompous and exaggerated role of Richard Dix is ​​brutal. The passage of time has not addressed the character of Isaiah, as well as other racial and religious notions, well, although the film is somewhat progressive about the roles of women and the mistreatment of Native Americans. The edition is especially weak. This is, without a doubt, the worst of all the "best" images.
