First of all, let me underline that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even if it makes jokes about minorities. The reason, for which I am quite sure, that this racist work is not worth seeing, is that it does not make fun of the minorities to demonstrate their condition of life, their social circumstances or the way in which society treats them. In addition, it uses all the stupid stereotypes and prejudices to strengthen feelings and xenophobic reservations. It's really a shame, but not a surprise, that the other comments did not understand that point, because we all laughed out loud. Congratulations.
