Inspired by a true story, it is full of feelings of the 70s, but is disjointed in the narrative. This is the story of a black swimmer from the university who ends up in Phillie in a recreational closing center in a bad neighborhood and somehow organizes a swimming team. The movie wobbles blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, as our hero, puts the children in the pool. At that time, it becomes a little attractive, although it still wobbles. There is a good story in this and it is clear why Howard and Bernie Mac participated, but the script is deficient and most of the direction seems to intend to make it feel like something instead of making us feel something for the story. <Br /> <br /> It's not the disaster that some criticism made possible, but it suffers for all the real stories of the sport: Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., that at least I knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie instead of letting the audience suffer because "it's true".
