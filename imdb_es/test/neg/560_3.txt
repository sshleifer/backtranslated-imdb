The young spinster, who is not associated with women of the same age and is seen by a gentleman from the retirement group, invites a seemingly mute young man to his apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and too educated to hide her own sexual insecurities, she feels very satisfied when the child feels comfortable in her guest room ... but not so happy when she starts going out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unfortunate actress, but I guess we'll never know why she was attracted to these sad-looking papers. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and as far from a commercial drama as could be achieved, this creepy material not only attracted Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sexual reversal of "The Collector," a label that may have sold the rights to the film, but that does not turn out to be a good cinematic idea. Even the best sequence of the movie (Dennis buying a prostitute to satisfy his prisoner) does not end, with Sandy acting sick and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is pretty good as the child who uses this cranky and sullen woman just for his comfortable excavations, but Altman handles it too timidly, with many strategically placed towels and flesh-colored undergarments (Altman clearly was not ready for a mature image with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; here he does not speak without thinking, thinks before speaking and is alarmingly careful in his actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a roll, with an apparent fall in mental deterioration that seems to occur off the screen. As such, the abrupt end is maddening, and the general results lukewarm. * 1/2 of ****
