6 of the 8 comments on this topic rated this movie as worth seeing, so let me correct the balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that independent British filmmakers have to offer, then they should save it. Your cameras right now and find work in another industry. Unfortunately for me, it was 82 minutes that I will never see again and I hope some of you avoid losing your own 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> While the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not sufficiently developed to keep the viewer connected. The characters of the students are insipid and uninteresting and, frankly, they will not care what happens to them. The soldiers are practically caricatures of all the bad guys that have been seen in the movie. I kept waiting for Captain Markovic to turn an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were pretty good and showed some imagination, but they were ruined by the surprisingly bad acting, the bad writing of scripts and the patched work of the camera. It is possible that the budget has been spent better by sending the "actors" (and I use that term lightly) to the acting classes or the Thomas Brothers to the film school or maybe to a spell-checker because the subtitles are poorly written The fact that the misspellings have not been picked up and rectified says a lot about the immaturity of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the filmmakers make positive comments, whether that or the other. They were watching a completely different movie. I implore the Thomas Brothers never to give up their daily work because, if they continue in this field, they will surely die of hunger.
