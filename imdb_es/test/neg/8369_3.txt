I am more or less between criticism and hate criticism. I have been a fan of Lovecraft (and a 'purist' of Lovecraft) for a long time, and although this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had several redeeming qualities. I went in to see him expecting the worst I've ever seen, and I wondered if Lovecraft would turn over his grave, but I was surprised to find out that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I do not like it. I do not want to catalog the faults of the film, so I'll just mention some that prevent this movie from being a "stellar amateur effort". <br /> <br /> It's a very low budget and it's filmed on a video camera, so it looks like some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea, it's no longer a big problem. The direction is quite amateur and the framing and the use of distance in the shots are quite clumsy. STILL, this movie was actually a bit creepy and stayed more true to Lovecraftian's intent than almost all the farces of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna (my main exception to those movies are Re-Animator and Dagon) together. The idea of ​​being impregnated by an old man is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which does not mean that this film is as good as those stories!), So the general plot is quite faithful to the ideas of Lovecraft. One thing that bothered me was that the words taken from the bible seemed to make a captive zombie angry and scared. I'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that the words of "God" bothered the Old Ones or just this particular zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of the Christian symbolism in it reminds me of the taking of the myths of August Derleth. So, in a way, this was a version of the Derleth style of myths. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie just out of curiosity. It shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with a near-zero budget. I liked the assembly of the cellars. However, the outdoor shots were sad. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same damned shot) to convey the long journey of 3 characters was really sad. The director needs to hit the head for that. The performance was standard for an amateur movie, with the blonde zombie girl receiving a personal award for "The best personification of Gollum by an Italian actress". Actually I think this movie was made before the Lord of the Rings movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris looked at her and thought: "Dang, she would be a great Gollum!" <br /> <br /> A small kudo for the director, however. The makeup of the zombies was like bad goth children. I was angry to see this and almost stopped looking. I was like "Oh, that's how we know she's evil and possessed", but later in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on an older woman's face (both alive). So it was not an attempt to say 'Gothic makeup = zombie' but rather, 'Gothic makeup was left after zombification'. However, Possessed / Zombie has the same 'blue contact lenses' ... heh. <br /> <br /> In general, I still like this movie more than the films of Yuzna and Gordan (except for the exceptions mentioned above). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie did a better job at filming a story like Lovecraft than on a small budget. <br /> <br /> A few quick words for the makeup artist: I know you wanted 'claws' or something on Zariah's fingers, but the long black nails looked very silly. <br /> <br /> A few quick words for the author of the score: I know you could not resist, and apparently the director who approved it could not, but when the two characters faced with weapons for a "duel", playing the whistle of "The good, the bad and the ugly" killed any mood that the scene had accumulated. It was cute, but cute was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers in this movie read Lovecraft and had a lot of respect for him. I enjoyed the little assents here and there: the character Carter with the bad dreams, and the character Pickman, who becomes a macabre zombie.
