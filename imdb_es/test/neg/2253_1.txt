Tarantino's previous films were about a boy in love with other movies. This is from a boy in love with his own writing. It's not Inglorious, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated the Inglorious Basterds. The goal of a movie is to entertain: if you call people who hit people and take the scalp from others! - and if there is an unforgivable sin that a movie can commit, it is a bore or an extreme dislike. <br /> <br /> The movie is just a collection of endless and boring and disgusting scenes of people speaking at tables in several languages. . There is even a scene in which 3 people talk for almost 45 minutes at the same table, before, fortunately, all are shot. I wished they had been killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F ** K. <br /> <br /> This style of conversation at the table is a hallmark of Tarantino, but in other films, I really did care what they said and the people who spoke . . Here, I could not care less. All of Quentin's films show enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here is a generalized feeling in each scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Of course there is torture and commotion in abundance, but you should remind me. Fortunately, the movie was so thin, I did not even remember that I had seen it earlier in the day, when I saw a review title on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> He is out of tricks and apparently dies to write a novel. But do us a favor, QT, and save us the movie. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie halfway and I would never recommend anyone to see it, no matter how fanatical the quarantine is. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10.
