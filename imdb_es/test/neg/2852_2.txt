This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the beautiful Lydie Denier in some of the scenes. Despite being 42 years old, she is an incredible woman in all aspects, her nude scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is as hot as hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about the movie, well, nothing really interesting to say, a neo-Nazi and a Turkish gang. fight in Berlin in scenes that include people who open shooting in the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people shoot each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and surprisingly after a few hours of shots, only three die and ten are injured LOL. <br /> <br /> While gangs fight over the territories of Berlin, a serial killer is killing young children and then leaving them painted white in various parts of the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective who although he now works for the police was a former leader of the Turkish gang and now is about to solve the murders of the serial killer. <br /> <br /> The movie is obviously a very bad scam from the classic movie of M. The murder of children, the participation of the underworld, the character of the serial killer and the final scene with the "proof" of the Serial killer is more than influenced by this classic movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the script just stupid, the production of the lowest possible standards and in general This was a great waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother renting this one.
