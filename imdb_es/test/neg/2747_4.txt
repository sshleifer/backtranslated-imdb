'AfterLife' is about a somewhat arrogant and reasonably rich man who discovers that his mother is dying and is taking care of his sister, who has Down syndrome. He can not be bothered with her, and basically he just wants to get her out of his hands; He has better things to do. At some point, she discovers that she has to take her to her, by car (she does not like to fly) all over the country. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds familiar, it's probably because you've seen `Rainman, 'a film far superior to its imitator,' AfterLife '. The fact that he copies the basic premise (heck, crosses some characters and even scenes) is not the fundamental problem of the film. The fundamental problem is that I did not care about these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother, Kenny (Kevin McKidd), is a bit of a womanizer. He has a girlfriend who appears and disappears in the story, and who learns to appreciate the sister of Down Syndrome (again, this is taken from 'Rainman'). He is a journalist who tries to get an interview with a doctor who faces a scandal. When he ends up taking care of Roberta, the sister, he does not have much time for her and, sometimes, leaves her alone for too long. When she walks away, he gets mad at her. Am I spoiling something by saying that he becomes a kinder and more loving person at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be "normal"; She is "normal" and she wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down Syndrome, and her performance is easily the best of the movie; Why did not the scriptwriter explore her character more? Well, probably because that would mean that the characters would get in the way of the story. When we surely know the story, did not the filmmakers see the problem they were creating? <br /> <br /> For a movie about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent, I think he is dead, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little the film has on the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are done in such a standard, boring way, with a dialogue so predictable and so standard, that I found myself rolling my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in movies, but it only works if you care about the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I really did not think there was much to worry about. `Rain Man 'has an emotional climax, but that moved me, because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climax, this movie stinks. There is a sequence at the end of the movie that starts as an incredible situation and ends up in even worse territory; An unforgivable trick is played to the audience. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offends the viewer's intelligence. Audiences are not stupid, and they know when the movie is cheating. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> There is not a scene in this movie that has the impact it should. There are some sequences that are fun, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I can practically see the script in front of me, moving in a predictable and uninteresting way, never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart. There are those false arguments that are reserved especially for movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why supposedly "realistic" movies do not realize that, in real life, anger can be irrational and sometimes people can not express their emotions and could say things that do not make sense or that they can not tell? nothing at all? All the actors in this movie deserve a better material. This film is not based on facts, but I think a documentary about a family with a member of Down syndrome would be much more interesting. In that way, we could have had truth and emotion. For some reason, the characters in this movie think that an emotion only involves saying something out loud and making an appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (of 5)
