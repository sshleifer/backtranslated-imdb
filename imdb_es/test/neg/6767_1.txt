EL RAP, the book on which this film was "based" was one of the most difficult books I have read. However, I could not leave it. Lewd, raw, disgusting, lascivious ... whatever it was, he had it. I also had some of the best characterizations of any novel I've read. <br /> <br /> Well, as for the movie ... it was deplorable. I mean, Tim Mcintire like Wasco? Wasco was the most bad mutha ... talking about WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco is like choosing Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the MAIN character in the book? Little arv. It does not even exist in the movie ... Walking fast was NOT the main guy in the book. Why even name this thing credit with THE RAP? None of the spirits, the atmosphere, the evil or the drama of the book were captured in this film. <br /> <br /> For me it was not only a disappointment, but a total loss of time and celluloid.
