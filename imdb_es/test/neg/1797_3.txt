Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness is a dark, profound and enduring novel that portrays the futility and irony that take place in Africa. If you are looking for a great book to read during the weekend, this is not the book for you. Conrad retains nothing when he describes nineteenth-century imperialism, but the novel has no meaning without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. If I read this novel in search of a great adventure story, I would say that I wasted my time, but observing the perspective of explaining the futility of nineteenth-century civilization, I would say that this is one of the most significant novels I have read. . Due to the fact that I read this novel in my English class and analyzed each page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone who was just reading it for entertainment. I will not lie, this book was difficult and challenges the reader to delve into this novel to find the true meaning. The film on the other hand seemed boring and boring. The movie, "The Heart of Darkness" does not even come close to doing justice to the book. The film omitted many key parts that I consider important to obtain the true message of the story. If you have difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel, then the film could be a good resource, but I would not recommend viewing the film as an alternative to the novel or even from a different perspective.
