I hope this is not an augury of things to come. High definition camcorders are becoming cheaper (although I would not swear that is what was used here), so it is open season for all aspiring Scrants and Tarantinos. of this stinker, and calling it a 'movie' would be doing great damage to the industry. The photograph is of a standard that you would expect in a family outing to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the woodwork. The remarkable thing about this is that nobody stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What got me was the title. I'm a fool for this kind of thing, like Frankenhooker, or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also pretty bad, but at least I laughed, and the acting was just bad, not horrible. I can not comment on Monsturd because I have not got a copy yet. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope the people who did this have not made money with it. Otherwise, they can be encouraged to try it again. Please, boys, paw the camcorder and go back to your usual job.
