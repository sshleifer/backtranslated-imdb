Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days of Wine and Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first that come to mind) were worthy of the Best Actor nomination. His only victory was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He becomes melancholic to science, but never balances it with the driver of his character. He actually made a similar character much better towards the end of his career at Glengarry Glen Ross than a note. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, the wonderful supporting work of Jack Gilford as Lemmon's partner and Thayer David as incendiary, is useless because the rest of the script is a jumble of cliched vignettes, anguish, neurotic nostalgia And a moralization without meaning. It is worth seeing once as a time capsule in the 1970 experimental direction of Avildsen.
