I could not believe how bad this movie was, and believe me, I did not expect a masterpiece from a movie made for cable. I recorded it just because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know that she's certainly an accomplished actress, so I do not know what happened here. The characters were shallow, the dialogue had stopped, the bad guys acted, and yes, that includes Seymour. It was nice to see her play against the guy, but not in something so bad. I realized that she had a credit for the executive producer, so she can not escape the blame for the evil of this movie. And oh, yes, they had Barry Bostwick playing the leading male role. 'Nuff said.
