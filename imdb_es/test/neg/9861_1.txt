What Game Over: Kasparov and the machine do better is to delve into the psyche of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see it becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unraveled, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived idea of ​​chess computers. Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated. <br /> <br /> Game Over tries to appear impartial, but it is clear that the director believes that IBM cheated. However, they do not provide any real evidence to support the claim of deception, only the hints that the IBM security surrounding the computer room was because IBM really had great teachers hiding there that voided the computer on certain key occasions, and Kasparov's claim that the computer did not work like a computer usually does so at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation in which previous computer chess programs had taken the pawn, which would lead to the eventual loss of the computer . Deep Blue did not take the bait, and Kasparov was so confused because the computer seemed to play like a human who did not even see that he could have played Deep Blue in a draw and ended up resigning. That game convinced him so much that he could not recover, and after playing games 3,4 and 5 at the draws, he lost game 6 horribly. <br /> <br /> The question of whether IBM cheated it all boils down to that one move in game two, where Deep Blue made the move that any human would make but that, until then, had fired at computers. Joel Benjamin, a great chess teacher on the IBM programming team, explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always tripped in that situation and, therefore, devoted a lot of time and effort to programming Deep Blue so that I would not make the mistake other computers make If you believe in Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director moved quickly and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the film, preferring to cut between shots of the 19th century chess game, The Turk and the Deep Blue shots, implying that Deep Blue was really controlled. for a human too. As someone who understands programming, IBM's explanation makes a lot of sense: if he knew what he was doing, it would not be very difficult to put something in the code so that, if the conditions are met, then do what you want and, in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that Kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. This is not cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is clear that the director believes that IBM cheated and that repeated comments on IBM shares increased by 15%. The day he won Deep Blue suggests the idea that IBM cheated to pump the price of its shares (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue to Enron). However, there are many external opinions, both from the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue won fairly and squarely and that Kasparov lost because he simply could not get past his vision of computers as "dumb machines" and He got nervous. For a machine that did not seem so silly after all. I only wish that the director let us see the alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
