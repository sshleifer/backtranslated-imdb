There has to be a 0/10 option for a bilge like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to see, but strangely convincing anyway. It's convincing because it seemed incredible that a movie could suck so much. I kept thinking that "it must improve". Got worse. And worse <br /> <br /> How on earth were people deceived to produce a piece of garbage so categorical that I'll never know? Most surprising of all, however, are all these criticisms that I see of people who really love the movie. Yes, the performance was good, but the movie was very, very bad. The worst movie of all!
