The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their faces despite the extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a boring story, badly inspired, without imagination. Why rewrite so completely a wonderful science fiction classic? Are today's movie audiences too modern for H.G. Wells write in large part how is it? The George Pal version of 1960 told a much more endearing story, even with low-budget effects, Eloi with a beach party look, and Morlocks who looked like the Smurfs on steroids. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version should have HG Wells revolving on his grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox it is an old science fiction cliché. This totally distracts from the love story with Mara (what happened to Weena ?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distracted tone from the beginning that makes the whole movie unbearable. If Guy Pearce's character were so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein have realized the dilemma of the time paradox? Did not 800,000 years in the future have you noticed? Of a Morlock nothing less, Doh! What's wrong with traveling in time just for fun, adventure and curiosity, as reflected in the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if he saw the first movie, would he realize all that Pearce was doing with the time machine when he saw it for the first time. George Pal's film carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​"traveling" through a fourth dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director does everything he can to make Pearce's character look geeky, an old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version, Rod Taylor was also a little nerdy (at least around Weena), but he managed to be a fanatic, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 1960s version, abandoned in the new version, is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Inflating the Moon to destroy humanity has no meaning, and does not do much for scientific literacy. For more than 4 billion years, the Moon has suffered impacts from much more powerful asteroids, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but this is simply silly and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is also stupid. Apparently, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to feed this thing. Blowing the machine to kill Morlocks is a kind of ecstatic 'machina ex machina'. Unfortunately, Pearce never returns to the 1800s to tell his story to his unbelieving friends, a key part of Wells' story with the irony that in a week the time travels into the distant future and returns. <br /> <br /> 6. The fact that Morlocks runs during the day completely ruins the macabre and spooky image of H.G. Wells of them as dark creatures of the night. A true lost cinematographic opportunity. In addition, Wells described the Eloi as fragile and childish. These guys in the movie seemed to be able to face Morlocks, if they were not so big with their babies. <br /> <br /> 7. Morlock's intelligent? a kind of Star Wars Evil Emperor - he had potential, but he's so stupid and distant that he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home. Boy, what a dramatic point! In the book, the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and struggle to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The hologram of the ball of fools in the New York Public Library is too much. It clarifies the idea of ​​human cannibalism. The 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that emitted a chilling and grim eulogy for humanity. Derailed evolution is a serious matter. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the wonderful effects of this movie can never make up for the fatigue of a suitable script. Save the cost of a ticket and popcorn and go rent the DVD when you leave (soon, no doubt), at least you can advance the opaque parts, just like our time traveler.
