This is a tedious movie. The real villains are the clumsy adaptation (it is shamefully easy to say that the original material was a novel) and an ingenious script. <br /> <br /> As far as credit is concerned, keeping in mind that the budget was adjusted due to the austerity of the war. The movie is not bad at all. And the performances are, in general, good, with the exception of Phyllis Calvert, which is fantastic, a miracle considering the potential of triumph, a well in which it definitely does not fall. Mrs. Calvert, with much less to continue, is as successful as Olivia de Havilland in Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> The only absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly conceived description of a black servant. It does not matter if he is a sympathetic character. Played badly by a white boy with black makeup, it is impossible to overlook this example of condescending racism. <br /> <br /> Sinister.
