Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and this similarity is the only one that this movie can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the mention of the character of Klaus Reicher, the homosexual encounter is a speculative fiction, and the claims of the film that Flynn mishandled the native work have no foundation. The director Frank Howson has not made any memorable film, and I think it is foolish for him to slander Flynn without foundation to pursue his career without complications. <br /> <br />
