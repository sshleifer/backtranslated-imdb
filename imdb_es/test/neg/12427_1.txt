I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate as low as possible just to make a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can not say much about it. It still seems to be very difficult to find on video. But I remember that my brother and I ran into him somewhere in the toxic mix of television on the UHF channel on the night of the mid-1980s, when he was about 10 years old. So I've never seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is escaping from a camp and they are paddling to an island to spot, and then they are attacked by a mad Scotsman in a kilt with an ax! They manage to escape him, but are attacked by the monster of Loch Ness, which in this movie is just a head and a neck without a body. The monster's eyes and mouth do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I mean that I had never seen anything of this magnitude before and I was totally surprised. I had seen some bad movies on television in the early 80s, but I had never seen anything so totally inept and so carefree and thoughtless that it seemed that the people who did it spent less time and effort than we saw it. I had already seen some of the Troma movies and those kinds of things that are deliberately "campy", but these were pure and real things and it was my first encounter with really bad movies. This movie was like the last breath of the drive-in era and I sensed it just in time. Actually, when we were looking at it, we could not figure out if it was made in the 50s or 70s. It turns out that it came out a couple of years before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Later, I got in touch with Mystery Science Theater and discovered many of the old B series and series, but I had already seen In this movie. The movie is so funny that I have never laughed so much with the team of Monty Python, Bill Murray or any comedian. After watching this movie, I was always trying to find the "bad" movies and I got involved with a lot of my friends. But this movie was and is basically impossible to find. I never really knew what it was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s, when IMDb took off, the Internet took off and information began to be disclosed. But this film still needs to be discovered by many others who could appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Search it.
