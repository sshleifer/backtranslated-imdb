It would be a mistake and it would be reprehensible to advise you to see Killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, wash the car, throw stones in a stream, but at the same time it is not as horrible as you probably think. . It's almost an appropriate movie, which is much more than most direct DVD sludges can manage. Killjoy 2 is helped a lot by Trent Haaga's manic turn as a clown, he throws himself into the role with such feverish abandon that he almost tilts the scales in favor of the film, but, of course, more than one man needs big shoes. Tammi Sutton offers the most entertaining director's cameo since Roger Corman in Creature from the Haunted Sea and everything is destroyed by the hurried sugary finish. All over the place and almost fun.
