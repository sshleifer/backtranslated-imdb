Sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed in this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. As for music, it's decent, but the presentation is just boring, big time. Most of the songs sound the same and lead singer / songwriter Jeff Lynne is as animated as a shop mannequin. He has a nice voice, but he does not have much to see. He only stops in one place and sings for one hour and 40 minutes. All the songs sound like chewing gum stuff from the seventies and eighties: nice but not exciting. <br /> <br /> Lynie is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, but she is not very animated either. The only song, of the 23, that creates emotion, is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven". Now, if only some of the other 22 songs had that emotion, this could have been a better DVD concert.
