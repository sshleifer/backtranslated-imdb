The big fat guy 'Uncle Buck', played by John (eats a lot) Candy, visits the healthy members of his family for a week to take care of two cute children (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) and pretty but snobbish Teen (Jean Louisa Kelly). The scams begin when Buck prepares breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed twice too small for his body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but peppered with two or three funny scenes, including Buck trying to talk on the phone with his angry girlfriend (Amy Madigan) and his meeting with a very nasty clown. <br /> <br /> It looks like Candy weighs 600 pounds.
