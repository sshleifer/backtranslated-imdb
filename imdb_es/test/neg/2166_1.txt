The founder of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman, is The Crapkeeper in this anthology film composed of two films that were such celluloid feces that Llyod tried to rescue them by combining the two in an anthology film and throwing large quantities of nudes whenever possible. Works? No, it's still bullshit that I would have to scrape my boots if I came inside. Does anyone like this mess? Of course, young Mongoloid youth with the combined intellectual coefficients of a Vienna sausage have to laugh at something, I suppose. For those who have brains that are even semi-functional, stay away and see something less insulting to their intelligence, even "Friend, where's my car"? <br /> <br /> My rating: F
