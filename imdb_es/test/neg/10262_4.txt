I saw it last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I expected the sequel to have the same funny and spooky spirit as its predecessor. Unfortunately this is not the case. The configuration is similar to the first, in which a horde of carnivorous demons came true when released from a horror movie that is playing ... (The first was a movie theater, this takes place in a building of apartments and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and slaughter ensue. That is practically everything that refers to the development of the plot. It worked very well in the first part due to the effects of macabre makeup, fast pace and unpredictability. The sequel, however, does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters that do not matter to us in one way or another. If they were annoying or idiotic, then at least there would be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably killed / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people are simply waiting for them to kill them. In addition, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and outside it), are constantly trimming between them, which took me out of the story. There are some funny snippets, courtesy of FX splash and campiness. Like a steady stream of blood dripping through the construction of one floor after another, as if it were an alien acid ... The first demonic possession of a grumpy birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a child Spooky demon makes his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with a child. However, that sequence becomes a puppet thing of a ridiculous-looking rubber demon that springs from the chest of the human child who constantly flies across the room to his victim. I pulled a couple of laughs from that scene, but I do not think that was Bava's intention. The scene probably would have worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman, but hey ... Other little things like acting too jealous of most characters and bad dubbing do not help. In short, I managed to see the unrated version on DVD, and I can not imagine having to sit completely on the only R-rated version previously available, because FX and makeup were the only things I got. . The first role of the future hottie of the producer Argento, Asia is also remarkable. In fact, it probably gives the best performance of the entire cast and is barely on the screen. Argento / Bava fans may want to see it just to see it, but they're probably looking at their watch, like I did. Gore fans may have fun with some of the fx, but they will laugh at their chairs at the most awkward looking evil puppet since Little Selwyn from Dead / Alive. It could make it worse, but it certainly is not up to the original.
