First, I must say that I really love Udo Kier and I have always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this train crash from a movie. Udo does not even appear until much later in the film and everyone's acting is just terrible. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, the "action" is laughable and the plot could be summarized in a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something to redeem myself in this movie, but I found my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating myself over and over again, "Oh Udo ... why? ... Why? ??? .. " If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, do not watch this movie. It will only make you feel sad for them.
