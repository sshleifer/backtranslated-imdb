A ruthless killer has been hired to eliminate someone at the top of the United States government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is known only as the Jackal. Everything about this hit man is a secret. Aware of the presence of the Jackal but uncertain of his purpose, the Deputy Director of the FBI faces the biggest challenge of his career. To track down this murderer in cold blood, he and a Russian intelligence officer, who is in the book, get the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, The Jackal is not your movie. It's a slow spy thriller with lots of gadgets and cool weapons. Richard Gere does a good job playing a passionate terrorist who is helping the FBI for a cause deeper than just freedom. And Willis makes a good effort like the Jackal. The movie is fine but nothing more.
