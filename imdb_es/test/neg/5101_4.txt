This is the 1990 TV show, not the 1979 movie. It seems to be three episodes with a total of just under 90 minutes. Before I saw it, I thought it was one of the versions of the film, and I noticed immediately that I had a TV series Feel I did not care too much. I felt that the story was not there, and there was not much emotion or drama. I often watched the time that was spent on my DVD player. How I was really bored. I also thought that part of the dialogue was, to put it politely, not good. Also, I thought that the acting left a lot to be desired. but that's just for me, however, it's good clean and healthy family entertainment. Certainly there is nothing offensive here. Children are likely to enjoy it. For me, The Black Stallion is 4/10
