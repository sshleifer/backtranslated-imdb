L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These films tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the 6.9 rating you currently have suggests that it has also been. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities at all. <Br /> <br /> Some non-spoilers, for example, include a 5-minute scene <br /> <br /> where the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where you breathe. <br /> <br /> In case you ask, this is not, in fact, art. Nor is it a comment <br /> <br /> about humanity, which by the title seems to be trying to be <br /> <br />. It is, in fact, boring. There are numerous attempts in this movie to <br /> <br /> say something about humanity. One might think <br /> <br /> about himself, "How shall I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will, of course, be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> It is not that these options are not interesting when they are done well, only that <br /> <br /> They are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does everything possible to make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes - <br /> <br /> therefore, this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloody vagina of an 11-year-old girl murdered <br /> <br />; It's a murder mystery, remember? Later, <br /> <br />, some people throw at each other and have what <br /> <br /> the director wants us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it is < br /> <br /> devised and too symbolic, but worse yet, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I like being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity, they did not know it existed and they are a little <br /> < br /> fear of. L'Humanité tried to do just this and it failed, and I left the theater without getting upset, but I got upset, thinking that I had lost <br /> <br /> my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie for <br / > <br /> free.
