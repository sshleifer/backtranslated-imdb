When renting this, I did not expect to be dragged. In fact, I knew it was going to be horrible. I was just seeing how horrible it really was. That's what comes with the horror of low budget. <br /> <br /> "Snakes on a train", which should not be confused with the summer serpentine blockbuster "Snakes on an airplane" with Samuel L. Jackson, it's about a woman who is subjecting a curse maya that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within. Her only hope of survival lies in a shaman who lives on the other side of the border, so she and her fellow stowaway board a train bound for Los Angelas. Add a few passengers and hilarity occurs. <br /> <br /> On second thought, however, the story is not so bad. Nor is it half well. <br /> <br /> The performance in this movie rivals that of an original science fiction, if not worse. Trust me, it's horrible. Snakes were another problem. It was supposed to be rattles, I suppose, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes that do not attack anything and there is a jingle sound effect that becomes really annoying. <br /> <br /> The bloody effects on the other hand, although not at the level of Tom Savini, were actually quite good. <br /> <br /> And another thing, the ending only compensates the rest of the movie. I'm not going to talk about that here, so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself.
