I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had high expectations and I was disappointed. First, they used all the clich√©s of racism in the book. It was so predictable. For example, from the moment the young Latino appeared, you knew he would be a good guy because he looked like a gang member. The character of Matt Dillon has been played a million times, a policeman who had hardened over the years and would see the light to some extent at the end of the film. Predictability just ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast wasted in a weak script. The moral of the story was PC to the maximum. There were some smart twists, but not enough. The dialogeo was embarrassing at times. It was not all bad. I just can not believe this high score of movies so far. It was entertaining, just a little insulting to intelligence. I admire what this film was trying to achieve but it fell short.
