Visually, this movie is interesting. The light is thrown literally in a way, along with the cinematography and a seductive introduction before the titles, which had my hopes at first, but then, a b-movie is a b-movie, it's a b-movie, it does not matter how much. You see the show. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the best-known serial killers in the world. Active around the beginning of the 20th century, Fish's life is hasty and blurry before he started killing children in old age. This film is based on two themes: the life of Fish and William F. King, principal investigator of the case. What prevents this film from becoming a Hallmark show and debacle of the usual kind, as long as it deals with movies about serial killers, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn focuses enough on the actors b not to let their flaws shine too much, but at the same time they created a really boring and stereotyped view of the American police through the angle of the King. Of course, she was thoroughly confronted with Fish's encounter with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl she killed, although I'm not really sure if her mother was the crazy media that Flynn really tries to emphasize that she was . . I miss more the psychological diving in Fish, not to mention the little time that was dedicated to the subsequent capture of Fish. All in all, interesting for those who are in serial killers, but above all a disappointment; However, if the director made another film about another serial killer, he would definitely see it in the hope that the holes would be repaired.
