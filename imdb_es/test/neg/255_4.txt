I'm in two minds about FOLLOW, the film debut of Christopher Nolan. A part of me admires him for costing him $ 6,000, but a part of me hates him for being too artistic. In many ways, it reminds me of the cult film PI, a film that I did not like, and I can not understand the central plot of a man who wants to be a writer and follow people. Would not it be more logical for someone who wants to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess FOLLOW gives independent filmmakers the hope that just because they made a no-budget movie that cost $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and more than five hundred members They will comment, but do I have to wonder if this movie would be so appreciated if it were not made by the MEMENTO director?
