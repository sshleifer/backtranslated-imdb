I have decided to leave this program of my memory in the toilet of a bad television program in the darkness of oblivion, disappointing, meaningless, the television show of garbage from hell. <br /> <br /> The Skyler boy who is the host / star / The creator of this program is boring, uninteresting, amazing, not particularly attractive and not funny at all. In short, why does this guy appear on TV and especially why is he in a comedy show when it's not fun, pretending to be a professional con man? When he is definitely no more than an obvious simulator? Others have already said it here, but this guy is totally false and fraudulent. If you believe in any of these problems, I think you should seriously consider having your head checked because they are all false and possibly true. Are they so useless, like spending all day to cheat someone so they do not give him a normal meal in a restaurant? Seriously, this guy needs to leave, glad that this show has been canned.
