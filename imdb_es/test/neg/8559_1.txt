I have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and more recently I found myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real shame, because I like these people, I just can not believe that SOMEONE could do something so bad. like this? !!!! This was crap from every possible angle. From camera work to dialogue, acting, costumes and production design, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this movie seemed to have been taken directly from a porn movie that was filmed in the San Fernando Valley and mounted on a set with an even less talented team. <br /> <br /> I just can not get over the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best materials I've read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream come true and have come to all possible obstacles ? However, the people behind this movie show do not have problems to put it together and, in fact, sleep well after its premiere. <br /> <br /> Life, what a trip!
