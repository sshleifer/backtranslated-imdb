... once "Hands, the hands of destiny". That was worse than this, much worse: but I had one thing: I had beautiful women with negligence fighting against each other, for about 20 minutes. This has a fat man of 45 years of age with 3 boobs and a tail, in a canteen scene cloned directly from "Star Wars". Not to mention an obese, seductive blue Uhura, her thick legs and her ass hanging from some kind of crazy bird costume, in this Method Acting Disorder. Did you always want to act before a "captive audience"? She must have referred to the lazy poor who paid $ 8 in hopes of seeing another "Khan's Wrath", or at least a "Journey Home." Captive "is right, I wonder how many people in the theaters tried to cut their wrists while shouting:" Mother, make it stop ". <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about it," Final Frontier "is not only An absolute disaster is a cruel and unusual punishment This is Star Trek from hell This is Shatner on mushrooms, or maybe peyote This is where no man has ever gone and wished he had never had it in the first place Or, paraphrasing a review of "Heaven's Gate:" It's as if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the Devil for the success of a television series, and the Devil has just come to collect. " <br /> <br /> And I can not even begin with a drunken Kirk and a smiling McCoy singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" together, as if they were lovers in a dream of fevered gay madness. Then we have the Hideous Dynamic Duo of Sulu and Chekov, walking together through the woods ... probably on the way to a concert by Barry Manilow. Then there's Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother ??? !!! Yeah sure! It's amazing how these relationships we've never heard of suddenly creep out of the wood when we need a new plot. And do not forget Spock jumping through the air after Kirk when he falls off a cliff in Yosemite. Of course. Reach Kirk and save him ONE FOOT from the ground. Where did you get those clever Rocket shoes, Spock?
