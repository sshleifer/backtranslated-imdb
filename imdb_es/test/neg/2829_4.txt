After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I hoped that it was not the usual Duff films that were given away because no one would buy them. I was wrong. Sheens' performance is on a par with that of a ten-year-old in a pantomime production of the school and the same goes for most of the cast. Neill is satisfactory, but he plays Russian and is not helped by his hybrid accent between Northern Ireland and New Zealand, and neither is the rest of the KGB characters, all of which sound as if they were at a Cambridge Footlights meeting. In fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras that offer a strange word here and there, and help us to know, at least, where the hell is all happening in what is otherwise a complete mix. The "spying" factor is not impressive for the most part and is mainly that Sheen is adorned with various ridiculous costumes while trying to blend in with the background, quickly becoming not only boring but laughable. The plot has potential but is completely killed by the rest of the confusing production elements. This could have been much better.
