In terms of quality films, this is not one of them. Actually, it's the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen and I was quite impressed. The fight scenes are slow and do not have much variety. Norris only uses many round kicks on all the bad guys that come after him, which makes the fights quite boring. The movie is also quite short, but for some reason the film does not even seem finished when it ends. It's a nice anti-climatic ending. Anyway, I've seen a lot of bad movies, and this is not one of the worst I've seen. It's worth seeing, I suppose especially for Norris fans. Nor is there anything like seeing a group of platforms flying through the desert, which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.
