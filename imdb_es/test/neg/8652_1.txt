My God, WHY, I lost my precious time in this movie? It's pathetic, very weird and unrealistic, and one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. If my life. I am embarrassed by the films of Yash Raj, the poor have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most unpleasant and sexual. Movie I've seen by Yash Raj Films. I shudder for them, I really do. Along with the terrible performance (or NOT acting, for that matter) of Uday Chopra, combined with the lack of talent of "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki does not have anything good at all. Even the music is not up to the standards left by YRF. The director, Arjun Sablok, did a bad job here. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I expected more. Much more.
