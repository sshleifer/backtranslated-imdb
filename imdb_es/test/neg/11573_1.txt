Within the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew that I was in one of those "pick at the faults" movies. The acting was terrible, the script was even worse. Those who let these people write, write so much shit for a movie, they have to feed the Komodo. With Russian Mig aircraft posing as airplanes of the US Air Force. UU And pistols that can shoot miraculously between 50 and 60 shots, the quick shot without recharging is a bad detail for any story. In one scene, Komodo is killing special forces troops at night, while in another he explains how the komodos and cobras are cold-blooded and do not come out at night. Also, with the fantastic special effects available in the current film industry, they were only average even for this low budget movie. <br /> <br /> All this said, I saw it until the end with curiosity to know what other wonders are the bad movies. Doing could produce. Shame Shame, for producing so much rot !!! <br /> <br /> This movie should have been left on the floor of the cutting room !!!
