Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about a tense chef played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up carrying her niece when her sister dies in a car accident. While she deals with family matters, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> Ununnyun Maudlin's tale without chemistry among the drivers (she is a dead fish and he is fine, but not much of anything). Seeing this, I was wondering why anyone would want to see this since the character of Zeta-Jones is so disgusting. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best thing she does is cooking for her therapist or talking about food. Ugh I will not use any of the many word games that come to mind. I could not finish it.
