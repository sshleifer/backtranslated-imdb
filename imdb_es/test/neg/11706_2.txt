I can not express enough how bad this movie was. First of all, it is a waste of some legendary stars, although they are quite old and unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well, I guess he must have done someone a big favor, since this was his last film role. The script is a disaster and the film seems terribly devastating. I imagine that if I saw this again when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However, seeing so many good horror movies, this was one of the worst. The only really convincing thing in this mess was the very young and charming type of Alice Krige. The young main character was trying to act the best he could, but it was absolutely terrible. I was not sure how much it was due to his lack of skill or the lack of an understandable script, but in any case it was just bad. Do not look unless you want to see a group of old people who are somewhat scared.
