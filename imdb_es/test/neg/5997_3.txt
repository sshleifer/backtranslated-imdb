Potential viewers are warned that the current rating of the IMDb viewer for "Tomorrow at Seven" is an anomaly of low voter turnout. It has an interesting premise: an assassin leaves an Ace of Spades business card at the scene of his crimes, while alerting the victim in advance. However, the execution does not make sense, and to say that the movie has a lot of frames in the plot would be to imply that there is actually a plot. <br /> <br /> Chester Morris plays the mystery writer Neil Broderick, weaving elements of real murders by the assassin of the Ace of Spades in his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to overlook the man's eccentric secretary: "If you line up your relatives, you would have enough nuts to hold a Ford together." This line takes him unceremoniously to Martha (Vivienne Osborne), the daughter of the "crazy person", who offers to make the presentations. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson) just as he is about to complete a puzzle. Puzzle delivered by a messenger that morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learn in the next scene, form the bold black shape of the As of Spades that contains the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night". Now which person putting together a puzzle does not use the pieces with contrast colors FIRST! <br /> <br /> Initially I was intrigued by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles as a pair of police detectives summoned in Drake's residence. In general, their characters are colorful enough to offer real comic relief, but here they are simply annoying. McHugh's Clancy in particular ends up shouting objections to the inane comments made by his partner Dugan, and both often go in the opposite direction when real problems may arise. <br /> <br /> Now here's a question: in light of the identity of Ace's killer, why would he have invited a novelist and a couple of policemen he just met on a flight to his plantation? Louisiana? Especially when at seven o'clock, all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed. However, it is not Drake who is dead, but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The first suspicion falls on the pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) after a scene of dull lights, but Henderson has not yet reported the murder to his supervisor until long after he arrives at the plantation of Drake with everyone else. Can you imagine someone trying to get away with today, unless his name was Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> With the cause of death yet to be determined, the local coroner is called, but he is the first one that shows up (an accomplice of Broderick) is a fake. However, when the true coroner appears, he simply disappears immediately afterwards! In a second dark scene, a letter from murder victim Austin Winters is about to be read. It ends up losing when the lights come back, and because it can point to the killer, it becomes a track that must be recovered. So, where was the letter? Winters' daughter, Martha, grabbed her and placed her on the mantle of the living room! How much thought was put into this? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole thing is so absurd that the character of Morris solves the case quite easily. Although the film arrives in about an hour, it becomes a difficult task to watch with all the nonsense that happens. There really is only one humorous moment that is worth repeating; While they are on board the plane, the detectives have this exchange: Dugan: "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> Except for McHugh and Jenkins, I can not say that I have seen any of the other players in the films of the time, although I am a fan of most "B" grade mystery movies. from '30 through the '50. Fortunately, the couple is much better at supporting Humphrey Bogart in a 1938 gem: "Swing Your Lady," where laughter is intentional. The best I can offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters about half of this turkey: "This is just a foolish waste of time."
