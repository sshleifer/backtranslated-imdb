Review: non-exploitation movies. They have been around forever. Some of those that come to my mind are the film of Alucarda, The Night of the Devils 2, The Convent and, of course, the desecration of Dante Tomasellis. I can not blame someone for trying to exploit a religious / sacred image and twisting it into fear. If done well, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the subgenre of nunsploitation simply titled The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls who live in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls who act in self-defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and not tell anyone. Fast forward, 18 years later, the nun is seeking revenge from those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Do you need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company produces? Well, here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. That's. Oh no, wait, I think they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But that's it. So when I consciously rented this movie, I knew I was not going to see anything that was really good. Still, with all that mental preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the only good things that this film has in its favor is its elegant appearance. The movie has a good cinematography. It does not look like a cheap horror movie. The special effects of the films were good, with The Nun being able to travel through the water. Well, that was an image that lent itself to some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched themselves into corny territory, but sometimes they were cool enough to look at. I dug that scene with the nun throwing herself at people like a bucket of water. It is not a particularly deadly movement, but it is a great image. There is some blood here, but not much. A particular scene that involved the death of an elevator was great, but unfortunately the film peaked with that scene. And it was halfway. After that, nothing really cool happens and the movie transforms into an incredible borefest. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes The Nun, popping up every now and then to give us a fright, she would kill someone and then CUT! We return to the characters talking badly, going through the rooms, opening doors, you understand the exercise. And I personally hate that a horror movie becomes that. People opening doors and entering rooms. Boring! And when the characters speak their terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, a character decides out of nowhere that the nun becomes flesh and blood every time she is in the water, so that is the best way to try to kill her. And everyone says simply OK! And everyone elaborates this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave this information to that guy and why did others simply take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but his scenes like that make the movie look stupid. <br /> <br /> And another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this movie was the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a very thick accent. When they try to speak English it is very difficult to understand what the demons are trying to say. I prefer that they be nicknamed, then try to find out what they are saying and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD does not have English subtitles did not help either. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a movie that has some visual effects, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. I guess this just shows that you may have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience can not connect to, then you still have a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you really want to have fun with the evil nuns, rent any of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the creators of this film, they should say ten maria of hail and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they will be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5.
