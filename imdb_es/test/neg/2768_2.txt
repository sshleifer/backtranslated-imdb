I could not get face or face of this terrible black cinema. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the performance was fine, but the quality of the image was horrible! Although I bought this in a "Double Pack of Gansters" (8 movies on two discs) in WalMart for $ 5.50 and when you put the DVD, apologizes for the terrible quality of image that some of the movies can have. <br /> <br /> The plot was flip flopping everywhere, I could not understand it and I had no idea what was going on ... then "The End" appeared and the movie ended. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say do not waste your money or time on this! Or if you also bought the double Gansters package, just skip this ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
