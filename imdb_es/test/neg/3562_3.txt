This movie tries to say something profound; I'm just not sure what it was. Too much remains unresolved at the end so you can understand the main point. A couple of scenes really make me wonder what was left on the floor of the cutting room. I do not think the wall was very developed. I never understood what was really happening there. When the mother finally revealed it, I could not make any connection with the child's silence. What was the point of the child not speaking? Was he just delirious or did he acquire some kind of power? What was the scene with the burned girl about? Another power that the boy has or what? I do not understand how any character developed or the plot moved. They gave me the bully but what happened to the dog? Did the dog return or did Mom get rid of Fido forever? <br /> <br /> There were several additional elements of the plot that were more disordered than of use. Like the radio program in the background that discusses the Iraq war. I think that was supposed to create some kind of comparison with the pain and insecurity that Mother and Addison were experiencing, but to me it was a distraction and a tension. I did not buy much the link. I also found the teacher talking to Addison about not saying "here" to pass too much list. The mother who saw the doctor did not make sense, how did it serve the plot? Was that to show how desperate the mother was getting, or was it something about medicine that I did not get? Was that dad the one returning in the last scene, or just a boy? So writing on the wall worked? What happened to the dog?
