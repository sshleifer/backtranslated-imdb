I'm from Texas, so I thought I knew big hair, but the villain in this movie had huge hair. When she was on the screen I could not concentrate on anything but her hair. Take the stage presence! There also seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie. There was a traffic police officer writing a parking ticket that, somehow, did not realize that the owner rushed to the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who could not hear a huge bulldozer approaching until he was 5 feet away. All the hit men in this movie seemed a little deaf, no one had to sneak out of them. The "hero" of this movie was so garish and ineffective that it was funny. The bar fight was pretty fun. There is an invaluable scene in which the hero and his girlfriend had sex and, judging by their expressions, it was not good for either of them. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is in the set 50 Movie Martial Arts Pack if you want to see many bad movies (with some decent ones).
