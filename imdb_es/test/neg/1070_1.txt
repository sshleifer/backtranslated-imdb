It is fascinating how this title manages to slip through the average viewer as something new and innovative (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have thought for himself: "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I will strive to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices", unfortunately, he even failed in his scandalous idea. The film is a complete failure. Considering that he strives to capture the brilliance of "Elefante" by Gus Van Sants, it makes him look even more ridiculous: the most embarrassing misstep for a film director. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the suicide of a student in the school bathroom. This scene, already, shows the uncomfortable acting skills of everyone involved in this scene. Do not buy a single word of what they say. He continues, interrupted by small snippets of interview style of children who "live in their married lives" with each bit somewhat anguishing in its simple stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue. Thalluri means presenting the characters in this way, giving them a quick look at the junk food in their hearts ... and it fails once more. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally shouts to the audience "Yes, people! I stole this movie and for some curious reason, I'm proud of it!" by taking the most unmistakable narrative style of Gus Van Sants from "Elephant": he filmed scenes twice so that the viewer would follow each character involved in a scene in their particular form and role in a school situation. Hm, does not this seem very familiar? For me, this very tolerant level of tolerance had been violated right there, to a point where I could not stand this terrible movie anymore. What a shame, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official selections in Cannes since 2006, while everyone must have remembered "Elephant" (2003) in the same Film Festival a few years ago! So, how, in the name of the Lord, did this dishonorable swindle end up being shown there? I am absolutely disconcerted by this error. <br /> <br /> Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of audiences that are not (and can not be) fully aware of every independent film there is. As Elephant has little to do with conventional cinema (although it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story told in "2:37" had been told before! I can not say how it is possible in a film festival of such importance attributed to Cannes. It is sad and shameful that these things are transmitted and almost no one sees the true fraud in them. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is, of course, only commercial, worthless as an independent film and (at some level) rather a false parody of his obvious idol, "Elephant."
