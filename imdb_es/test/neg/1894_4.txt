Yes, this strange feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, it is another feature of the 1980s about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. In this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing, a wild young man raised by a lady from the stock market after his parents were killed by a dirty policeman in the take (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the lord of the local crime (Robert Davi) . Add local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you'll have a recipe for some uninteresting action sequences. Davi is the highlight among the cast, and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. Otherwise, this is a fairly lumpen action image that will not satisfy fans of the action and will leave Sayles' fans speechless.
