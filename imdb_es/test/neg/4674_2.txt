I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that I'm becoming one of those left liberals who are rightly mocked in South Park. Because I found it enormously offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? First, there is the old staple food that is that America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Second, and chilling, is the early meteor hit that hits some (no name? Why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "My God, imagine the tragedy that * could * happen". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It could happen to white Americans, and "that" would be tragic. <br /> <br /> Then, later, a larger meteor will arrive in Paris. Our cast on the floor is irritated, because this could mean that our children have less time than they thought. Not very annoying in America. It is not mentioned that many people have died. <br /> <br /> Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. A black man has never been so symbolic. Among a team of unconditional borers, their work seems to be on their backs, occasionally saying "Hey, man." Really. Why did they even bring it? It's not like it was small, it weighed that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, run a spaceship or even help fix anything that explodes. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor lost in a meaningless role), he seems drunk most of the time and hits things with keys instead of fixing them because "Dat is how we do things in Russia, "is quite horrible. <br /> <br /> All cemented of course by blond's site, All blue-eyed American children celebrate in the corn fields when they are saved and all is well. Because all death and destruction to the rest of the world are irrelevant. <br /> <br /> You expect bad writing, bad action, the unlikely plot (fat and middle-aged men trained in 12 days to be astronauts). ? Including one that seems to be delayed?). But I could not believe the racism and xenophobia involved in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone who is not American fed by corn. <br /> <br /> It is a chilling accusation of the attitude of a section of Western Society for the world. <br /> <br /> And it's also a fucking movie.
