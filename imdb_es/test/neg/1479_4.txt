So boring you will fall asleep after the first 20 minutes. I'm sorry, Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "films" that he directed, such as "Tristana", "Sans logique", etc ...) but here, the plot is extremely ... vain! Except the magnificent photography, everything seems stupid and there is no envy to know what will happen to these "media" actors. In addition, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often that it seems like a sham. Believe me, it's a pure waste of time (in relation to the plot), and 3 hours is a long time. Certainly the real reason for this total box office mess!
