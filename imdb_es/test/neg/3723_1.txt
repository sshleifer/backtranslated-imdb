WARNING! SPOILER! This movie is absolute shit. It is not entertainment. I do not have the words to describe the disgust I felt at the end. <br /> <br /> This is a badly made film about the scum of society. Throughout the film I kept waiting for him to improve. He did not do it. Instead, he continued to get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie that is as bad as this, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case it proved impossible. I have nothing good to say about it. How bad was it? Well, here's an example: Towards the end, Dan Akroyd drowns and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! This is not entertainment!
