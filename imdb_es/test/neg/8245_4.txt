I'm destroying my brain, but it seems I can not think of another movie like The Valley of the Gwangi. A western with dinosaurs? What can be more natural? You have to ask yourself why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> The plot ?? While looking for a mythical miniature horse for his circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the cast / characters entered a strange lost valley. There they not only find the horse in miniature, but also other more fearsome creatures. Dinosaurs rule this place. Would not that be an attraction in the TJ circus? a T-Rex caged? <br /> <br /> It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie, it seems that I have not enjoyed it as much as many others who have commented on the film. There are some parts that I actually find almost unacceptable. For the first half of the movie, there just does not seem to be much to do. It was not necessarily boring, but I wanted something to happen. The training would be an adjective that he would use. To top it off, the film presents a very artificial love story. He feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leaders only had to meet. But the Gwangi Valley is not a total waste. There are moments that I really enjoyed. Who does not like the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to tie a T-Rex? You just do not see things like that every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are awesome. There are some really cool photos of the Harryhausen miniatures interacting with people and horses. It may not represent the best of your work, but the effects are very nice. Still, at least in my mind, these good times are not enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate doing it, I have to qualify the Valley of the Gwangi in 4/10.
