I get the feeling that many people liked this movie (not all people, but many) because they do not want to admit that they do not understand it. People of average intelligence, so to speak, who pretend to be so avant-garde and modern that they think Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> Lynch, for me, is like Tarantino. Both are great, but none is the messiah as many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And they both make dirty movies sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, since this film was designed as a pilot first and then turned into a movie, it was not done with all the passion and foresight that one should include in a movie. Face it, much of the movie is unintelligible and can not be understood. We can all invent meanings, Lynch can have his own vision, but none of that matters. It was scattered incoherently on the screen. It is true that the first part had the appearance of an intriguingly interesting story, intricately convoluted, but then hesitates. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of the men with their phone calls, the lawyers ... are lit. I can almost imagine David Lynch screaming, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to everyone, "Look how crazy and weird I am! Is not it great? It's so weird and crazy!" Strange and crazy works if it is a by-product of your style. However, it is pretentious and tired when you strive to do nothing more than that. It's like all those Pulp Fiction flashbacks that came out after Pulp Fiction. It just is not great.
