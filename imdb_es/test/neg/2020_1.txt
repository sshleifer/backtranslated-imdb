OMG. And here I thought there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the amount of decisions needed to produce a movie. Conceptual approval The writing of scripts. Edit the dialogue. Foundry. Set and prop design. Location selection Interim. Synchronization. Cinematography. Illumination. Music. Sound and video editing. Address. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that each and every one of those decisions was taken wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a supposedly set movie In the 2900s, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta movie of the 1970s. set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is atrocious. The time of each scene is ridiculous. The performance is beyond the abysmal. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Take only accessories, for example. If you have a movie on a space ship built in 2900, how likely is it that you have the exposed pipes and hydraulic doors of a 1960s oil tanker? What, technology has not changed in 900 years? The "Professor" uses a standard tandy keyboard and Radio-Shack switches to "reprogram" the computer. What, have not yet discovered the voice control? Of course, the teacher is tied to a wheelchair. With wheels. Although, you know, they have an intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating one, or bionic legs or something like that. And apparently, this freighter was carrying an intergalactic shipment of rosewood coffins. How convenient. Then there are the weapons: the crew carries standard firearms of the late twentieth century. In a boat. In the vacuum of space, where a bullethole would kill them all. Good planning, support department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why continue?
