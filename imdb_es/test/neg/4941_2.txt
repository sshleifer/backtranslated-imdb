Do not choose this. **** Spoiler alert ***** The plot of this film is so aggravatingly bad that four friends talk about taking the bus from the airport by a very enthusiastic driver. In the shuttle with them there is a type of business that seems quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> Shortly after your trip, the ferry driver takes an exit ramp and a crazy driver tries to take them off the road. The end result is that they get a puncture. The driver puts one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the cat slips and the men's fingers are crushed between the rim and the shuttle. It is at this point that the driver reveals himself as a kidnapper and has taken all the people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the film becomes extremely slow and tedious, since the characters do one thing lame after another. One of the men is killed trying to escape, even that he lacks suspense. Finally, it is revealed that the boy from the milquetoast's business is in connivance with the driver when the boy from the milquetoast kills the other male friend by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of attempts to escape by women. Milquetoast is hit in the head with an iron tire, but he survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also hit and somehow survived a collision with a fence at high speed while kneeling next to the steering wheel. Somehow, he did not get through the window or get seriously injured with a collision with the windshield. However, the woman driving the shuttle is unconscious; however, he had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> Finally, he is able to subdue women and make them stay with them. An underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. One of the women is murdered. The other stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized part of the broken mirror and shoots / slashes at the head, but is capable (in what should be a very weakened state: severe blood loss, two head injuries and one to drag her out of the shuttle, drag her into a big box, throw her away and lock her up, all the time with her fighting fiercely against him. <br /> <br /> Now some people admire the movie's message about trafficking. people and how it is happening today This is a serious problem, but making an extremely boring movie about it does not entitle you to a higher rating.
