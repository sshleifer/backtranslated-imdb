Top gun without the internal animosity. Or the class. Or the money. Or cruise. An excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of the next big players to market their ability to run a matinee in which this really has nothing that anyone can get into. It's a shame because the first shot of Charlie Sheen opens with a great promise that is wasted almost immediately with an absurd wedding game. Barking <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a changing actor for me, but in this movie he's fine, particularly the action sequences. Michael Biehn is a first class action hero, but not a protagonist: Charlie Sheen is, for all intents and purposes, the protagonist, but never an action hero. There is a trick of hundreds that are also worth mentioning. 3/10
