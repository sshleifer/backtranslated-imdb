Based on a story by Ray Bradbury; A professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a small desert town, where most citizens would want him to stay away. A lonely child (Jonathan Carrasco) clings to him for attention; and both witness the landing of an alien ship in the rocky desert region. The aliens become images of townspeople. Kerwin must convince the evacuation of the city and falls in love with the child's mother (Elizabeth Pe√±a). The acting is quite superficial; the story line is not worse than some others; This movie leaves you with the feeling that you shortened in a decent ending. The cast includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
