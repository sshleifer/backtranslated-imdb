This is one of those movies with great potential. Actors brilliant, a debut of a very interesting director and a complicated plot "Survivor". <br /> <br /> But it does not work at all. <br /> <br /> To start with the good: The cinematography is dazzling. The beauty of the Namibian desert is shown as a ruthless environment, also in the photos. And then there's the performance. Fairly good. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from "Short Cuts" by Altman. <br /> <br /> Then, the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why the hell does Levring choose "Lear" for his game? The idea of ​​letting Shakespeare articulate his desperation and his inner longings does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies take place due to the choice of "Lear". They should only fit into Script by Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And sex. It takes about three days, then more or less all the characters feel sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easy way out when a crisis is needed in a plot. The part of Janet McTeer falls apart completely, mainly because of that ridiculous idea. Sex causes the plot to fall quickly to the ground. Instead they could have focused on the dialogue. There must be a conversation between all the characters, but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups. However, their conversation is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The King Is Alive" is not yet the worst film of the Danish dogme '95 yet. But comparing it with the most recent of the home movies of dogme '95 "Italiensk for begyndere" by Lone Scherfig, this flaw badly. It is not a good movie. It's a bad one But it's beautiful.
