This must be one of the most annoying, arrogant and poser movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretension. It is clear that there is virtually no argument, even if this part of Greek history is material for great films. He simply had in mind some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes and built a whole movie around him. Death is the main theme and it is repeated until the end, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the film, but unfortunately it is the film itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development at all, nothing, zilch. I usually complain that some movies have two-dimensional characters, but, oh, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is annoying to us and demeaning to some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, look like wood. <br /> <br /> And going to the core of the making of Angelopoulos movies: No, we are not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please, someone tells this boy that the symbolism has to be subtle. Theo, do you really underestimate your audience or are you just incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to do a Greek "meter". No matter how he tries, he can not get to Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only salvation: photography, costumes and music.
