I saw this movie based on the good reviews here, and I will not make that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first couple of minutes shows that a group of people has come together because of a tragedy, but I do not see what it is. Go back 12 hours and we can see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end have no meaning for what is about to happen. When the end is finally revealed, you realize that you only lost an hour of your life waiting for a great reward that does not happen and does not mean anything for what you have been seeing. The only connection these people have is that they have all had a "bad day", but even that continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If this was supposed to be a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
