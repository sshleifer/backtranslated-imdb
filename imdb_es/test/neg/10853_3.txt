A very bad movie, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: in an early scene, the Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; instead of remaining in their trenches to shoot them, they advance in the open to fight against them, contrary to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is supposedly the daughter of a white Russian and is obsessed with her Russian character, but does not speak Russian; A German aviator ravaged by guilt attacks an anti-aircraft weapon. However, the weapon does not fire shrapnel projectiles, but it receives a direct impact on its "plane", which does not look much like a German World War II aircraft. To be fair, when they were able to escape from the absurd plot and the consequent absurdities, there are some genuinely powerful moments: the representation of people who die of hunger slowly becomes convincing and moving, but these only manifest themselves even more. A movie to avoid.
