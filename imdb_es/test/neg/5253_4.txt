I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a good part of the film was filmed here, in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. It's not as horrible as other users say, but it's definitely bad. It is a monster that kills people in a sixth century castle and Lambert, the one who comes to kill him. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters suck, and the action is not too good either. Also, maybe the only thing that could have saved this movie, the special effects, are also very bad, the monster looks horrible (it's not scary, but it's horrible). Oh and another bad thing: the music. The film tries, and manages to create the atmosphere of the sixth century. But all the action sequences are presented in rock music, which is very bad. I mean that the action in rock works perfectly in a movie like Charlie's Angels, where that's the perfect way to film your action. But here, it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
