This movie fails on every account. To begin with, it is pretentious, striving to be "significant" and fail miserably. The script was banal in the extreme, nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to worry about any of the characters. Knightly was a waste of self-esteem time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The part about the soldier who went to war was a cliché even before the movie Atonement used it. The use of World War II as a backdrop was itself a cliché ... bombs, shelters in subway stations, etc. ... employees to import a bit of the drama that is so badly needed. Why someone thought for a moment that it was worth doing this movie is beyond my comprehension. It was another case of "let's get the costumes to look authentic, no matter the story, script or acting!"
