This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to overcome the incredibly bad delivery of lines and terrible emotions. The plot is quite interesting. A wreck occurs (apparently because it was made of ropes and balsa wood), and a couple of types are found on the shore. If this was not bad enough, a guy named Count de Sade also lives there. He lives in fear of the pirates and has gone completely crazy. Anyway, he has a great slave, a young girl and some dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and his wife, who is a leper. Anyway, things go wrong since these men have to deal with this nut case. He is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. The rest of the film implies an attempt to escape. It has an ironic ending that I will not reveal and rescue the film. I would not mind if it were you.
