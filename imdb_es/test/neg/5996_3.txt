The first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern British cinema. Director / adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a film audience. Fortunately, the quality of the address and editing improved significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage was done. From the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy clean the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Arthur, by Jonathan Firth, and Mabel, by Karen Hayley, who are given enough freedom to express their lines with the true comic sense that Wilde intended. The ostensible cables, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are by comparison tarnished and of wood. In an obvious attempt to spend every last penny on a meager budget, the work has been nominally updated to the 1990s, but in conjunction with the original script, the effect is rather a dramatic television drama of the seventies. The true moments of the comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive they are very funny, a sign, perhaps, that a more sensible pruning of the rest of the work could have led to a more balanced film with a better rhythm.
