I had read the reviews of this film in the newspapers and I must say that my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this successor is one of the worst movies in history. I would rate it among the top 5 of the worst movie I've seen. Why do I say that? First of all, there is such a thin story that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term "story" are sometimes kept loose, but most of the time the film moves without any purpose or unity. The whole story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it sometimes becomes a farce. <br /> <br /> The actors appear but do nothing to merit any credit or rating. The most embarrassing are the main ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who exaggerate or are extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are not brilliant either. To be honest, I really do not understand how they would want to associate with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh, where should I? start. There are many unnecessary movements of the camera that make the experience painful. Combine that with an extremely faultless edition and start looking for a wooden spoon to cut your heart. Especially the scene in which the whole gang is moved out of prison to be transported by car. The zoom of the camera for each person becomes boring and when it is in number 3 of 12, the message appears: wow, you are great and can do simple zoom effects, NO. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny, but it becomes extremely embarrassing and you walk away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please, explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ... if you have to choose between endodontic work and see Ocean's 12, I recommend the first one. Make sure they do all the teeth while you're at it ...
