I'm a fan of some of the holiday movies, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's out of place. Made for TV National Lampoon movies do not work well on TV. This movie is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were excited when this came out, but we also had to face reality ... it's a television movie. Randy Quaid is fine as Cousin Eddie, but he is better in a supporting role than in the lead role. Dana Barron sets the story as the first actress to repeat her role as one of Griswold's girls. She is just as pretty, but it does not help a slender script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made? Probably it was because NBC recently resumed another few years of Christmas Holiday presentation. There is nothing wrong with acting. Everything is in the script. It's just not so funny. People need to think before writing things like this. It's a Christmas movie that I do not recommend.
