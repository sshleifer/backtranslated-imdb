After reading _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can not begin to express how disappointed I was with this movie. Although I agree that some poetic licenses may be admissible, this film is in constant variation with the books, making an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the writers, directors and producers of the film have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's vibrant characterizations become figures of wooden sticks, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the realism of the books has been modified to include more appropriate ghost monsters for a caricature. And why does an Egyptian henchman speak Spanish? Geesh, it's no wonder that the movie has become a television miniseries. Did Wilbur Smith have any involvement in the making of this film? I can not believe I did it. Terrible, terrible movie. If you have read one or both books, do not waste your time or money looking at this money. I will be very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of supreme generosity convinced me to give this movie a '2' ranking, and that only for the beautiful, sometimes spectacular, photography.
