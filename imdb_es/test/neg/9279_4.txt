This film is a window to the world of Great Britain in 1973, a world of holiday camps, fags and birds. Actually, I was in Pontins Prestatyn while filming, so it's fascinating to see where I spent my childhood vacations and what world we have left behind. The "plot," as it is, refers to Stan and Jack's attempts to turn a job into a holiday camp (£ 25 a week!) In an opportunity to chase young women and liquidate Blakey. They are joined by the rest of Stan's family and some laughs are due to Arthur (Michael Robbins) and the persistent work of Olive (Anna Karen), as well as the sheer rarity of Blakey, but the idea of ​​young girls seeing any desirable thing. in the brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or the lustful Jack (Bob Grant) is simply laughable. Sufficiently harmless at the time, now it's just a curiosity from a bygone era.
