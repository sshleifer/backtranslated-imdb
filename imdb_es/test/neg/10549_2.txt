The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the surprising revelation that after Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura, who apparently was fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio) had freed his hometown of Tromaville, it became a pleasant place to live. This meant that Toxie no longer had use as a superhero and now suffers from depression and a feeling of utter uselessness (like the directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz should feel after producing this), Toxie now works as a janitor in the 'Center Tromaville for the blind. ' It is not long before the problems arise. However, the head is ugly. However, an evil chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid and insignificant reason, but to do so, you must get rid of Toxie. After the evil president's first plan (Rick Collins) fails, he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home behind Toxie heads to Tokyo, Japan. Once there, Toxie starts looking for his father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his search. Meanwhile, back in Tromaville, Apocalypse Inc. moved to kill and without Toxie, citizens have no power to defend themselves. Toxie finally finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) who has been made to believe that he is his father, however, Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz, this follow-up to the hit The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically shows that the first movie was a coincidence, a lucky accident combining the right combination of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence and so bad. -It's a good movie, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a load of shit in comparison. The script of Kaufman, Phil Rivio and Gay Partington Terry with a lot of credits of "additional material" does not contain a single funny moment during its full duration of 102 (without director cuts). The visual gags are terrible, Toxie walks through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to mix, for example, or a scene in which a bathroom with a bad boy is heated and while cooking Toxie throws a lot of vegetables and spaghetti. a scene in which he places electric wires in a woman's nose, sticks an antenna on her head and a microphone in her mouth where a Japanese radio announcer speaks, a bit where a bad Japanese boy has his nose burned in the shape of a fish, a bit where Toxie takes a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or the stupidly stupid and sober facial expressions shamefully malicious, a literary type has a head for a fish and becomes literary for sushi, the horrible comedy music and sound The effects and the whole movie in general is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. The gags of bad taste are not there this time and the silly childish childhood humor of the first is also missing, it feels like a real step back from the original and do not forget that here is Troma, which is definitely a bad thing. There are some bloody fights and some serious gore and violence, at least in the 102-minute version, supposedly uncut, that I saw, heads smashed with bloody bodies, crushed faces, intestines, roses poking into someone's eyes and thorns wrapped around his throat, ripped off his ears, his arms cut off and a very graphic and bloody scene of a man being cut into pieces. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not particularly convincing and occur mainly in the first twenty minutes. The acting is of shameful proportions as I have already mentioned. In regards to the action, there is a pursuit of ultra-cheap looking cars at the end and some dazzling and unattractive fights using cardboard ninjas throwing stars at one point. As for the horror, there is nothing that separates a few bloody pieces. As for the comedy, this is very funny. In fact, The Toxic Avenger, Part II sucks at all levels and, to top it off, it is also atrocious, most of the cast seems to be people taken from the nearest corner, continuity does not exist, cinematography is a basic point. Shooting and special effects are anything less. One or two bloody scenes, apart from this, is total, simple and simple, do yourself a favor and look at the original again.
