Six months after the passing of the high school sprinter Laura during a race, a murderer begins to kill the rest of the athletic team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that is the absurd plot of the 80s slasher Day, a lackluster addition to the genre. that offers very little in terms of style, originality or decent blood. <br /> <br /> What it does offer, however, are some amazingly horrible musical interludes, some familiar faces (including an early appearance of Scream-Queen Linnea Quigley), and a bit of nudity (a prerequisite for any slasher movie!). <br /> <br /> So forget about the scenes of death: they are boring and quite bloody and, instead, enjoy the movie in a more memorable way. Garbage elements: rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the Roller nightclub, which is accompanied by a long song of heavy rock, 'Gangster Rock', played by the unforgettable and terrible crime, an improvised session of improvisation on the part of the students of the school; Christopher George condemned him as the head of the coaches, Michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who abandons his students (who, for some reason, find it quite irresistible?!?!). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the action is accelerated a bit, with the discovery of the bodies of the children sacrificed under the stands, and a rather twisted scene with the corpse of Laura in her robe and beat, but all this comes too late to save this film from mediocrity.
