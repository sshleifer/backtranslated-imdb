The new celebrity fight is terrible. They kill popular people and make low budget celebrities win. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil flip? Lil flip and Lil Wayne should die. Lil 'flip sucks. The fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' Bow wow and Lil flip was MAD corny and short. They should just kill them all. Why did Tobey lose with Jake and Christian lose with Adam? They are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking instead of fighting, which can bore viewers. Everything seems rushed for some reason, can not they just make a long fight? The old Deathmatch is much better.
