The most fertile man in Ireland revolves around Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy boy towards women. Everything has changes for Eamon when he is seduced by a woman (as far as I can remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his virginity, but discovers that he has a superpower. Despite having protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. The doctor tells him that he has a very high sperm count. Her mother comes up with a brilliant idea that makes us see babies with ginger heads at the end of the film. He begins to help women on both sides of Belfast to conceive babies. First, voluntarily, and then with the help of his colleague he runs a business. The most fertile man in Ireland has his funny moments, but he needed to create better jokes and a better script. I could not help thinking that it gave me the impression of a television comedy instead of a movie. Kris Marshall is a different name on the silver screen but it does not shine like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in this or that movie. As if I was really in love (I think it was very funny in that). Well, it was good to see it, but I could not help falling asleep from time to time. ** outside *****
