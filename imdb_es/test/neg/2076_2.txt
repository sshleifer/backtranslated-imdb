When I saw this in the cinema, I remember making a face at the bad performance of one or two minutes in the first scene, and immediately I said "no, this has to improve". He did not do it. The performances are fairly uniform in teak and pine and no, there is NO sexual chemistry in this movie, only the uncomfortable postures of a reasonably beautiful and discreetly untalented actress who seems to have been born to embellish the cover of "Interviú" and not much more . If the scriptwriter thought that turning Mérimée into a character was an incredibly original creative tactic, perhaps more should come out. And Aranda, if she had reflected a little more on the matter, she would have realized that Carmen's story is CRYING a parodic, iconoclastic, reflective deconstruction, not this matter of leaving the brain on the tourniquet. Of passion ersatz and dialogue of comics. This is contemporary Spanish cinema at its worst. <br /> <br />
