Kazuo Komizu, who has not made a decent film, directed this "notorious" commotion and should be ashamed that it was a success in its release in Japan. <br /> <br /> Yes, it presents scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? It has the style of a bad American movie filmed and badly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> It seems that it has gained notoriety for its list of anti-social acts. <br /> <br /> There is a big difference between this and the horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone likes their movies a little wet does not mean they accept trash. I like this. On the contrary, that type of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less trash than the average player, because he has seen a lot and has become too demanding. It is a pity that the production companies do not realize that. <br /> <br /> A critic here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film "almost obsessed with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed him. I do not agree. The subject is never the subject. The problem is how that topic is treated. In THE RESTRICTIONS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the graphic representations of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is pitiful.
