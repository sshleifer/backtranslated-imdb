This movie is a definitive 5. I finally caught her on HBO the other night. I remember when he appeared in theaters and told a friend that it would never be a success because Americans did not want movies about history, especially films that were more about ideas than action. I do not know if that was the reason why FMLB did not do it well, but now, after having seen it, I can add some observations of my own. <br /> <br /> First, while Dwight Schultz has been good in Star Trek and The A-Team, since the protagonist of this movie is unpleasant. I kept waiting for him to shout in the style of Jon Lovitz, "I'm ACTING!" The phrasing and the tone of voice sounded as if it tried, it had to be an ACT-OR, in a scenario where I had to strangely emphasize several words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I enjoyed the clever positioning of the character of Paul Newman as a manipulator who, at every step, strives to drive these cats (scientists) to achieve their goal. <br /> <br /> Third, there was a discussion about the moral implications of the creation of pump A and whether EE. UU I should use it. Probably not enough, or with the depth that is justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, there seems to be a lot of twists thrown for a dramatic effect. I do not know how much of the events in this film are real, but things like having the test bomb in your chains or a laboratory accident caused by a cup of spilled coffee (and as a result a dead scientist) stretching the limits of credibility. Maybe those things, or events that were similar, really happened, but it felt as if several scenes were added only for a dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> FMLB was fine. I need to read more about the real events to know if it was exaggerated or just for the most part accurate.
