For any Nickelodeon fan who used to see the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good. You had entertainment acts like "You can not do that" on television. You had weird but good shows like Pete and Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But like Disney, Nickelodeon has plummeted, limiting its demographics to shallow preteens and giving us bad excuses to invent new and innovative shows. While trying to see Zoey 101, I shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The adjustment could not have been more false than this. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, which has everything a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in each room, cool bedrooms to hang out, etc. The children in this program are rarely seen in class and there do not seem to be real teachers. It seems more like a place you would spend on a good summer vacation instead of working and studying while you prepare for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that discouraged me. Each episode consists of problems of children, situations that they themselves caused and problems that must be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in everything she does, and each of her friends asks for help when she feels she is in serious danger. Only taking it to have no other side. I've been through school and I can tell you that no one is like that. Chase is mute. Logan plays the arrogant tough guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is very unrealistic in what he does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is fine, she is a tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique to these characters and different from other personalities? Is being stereotyped the best that the creators of this show can create? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with the sense that there is a lack of creativity that involves their roles. There is nothing to be surprised or surprised. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the show is clearly for the intention of targeting children of adolescence, who face a stage in which they must evolve from being children. to be an adult. During that period, they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions and do the right thing for them. Zoey 101 does not contain any of those values. In this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotyped personality is all you need to be successful. I'm sorry, but that just is not true. People can not expect things to be delivered to them as the actors in this show are and just let those things stay there. If I expect things in Zoey 101 to happen in real life, then I would be living in a fantasy world locked in a dream house. Nothing in this program is related to those who face health and money problems. It also does not relate to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that only falls flat on his face. It shows a horrible message to the children and I think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it does not have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a child act and look stupid. A horrible sight, and you must forget about the rest of the garbage that Nickelodeon has been doing in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
