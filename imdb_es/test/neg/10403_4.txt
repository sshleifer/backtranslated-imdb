Stanley Kubrick, a director who has the highest esteem for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, the Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) brought the film to circulation, leaving it alone for hardcore. Fans and completistas. After watching the movie for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already perfected his photography profession for the LOOK magazine, and had made some short documentaries. Like many novice filmmakers who came after him decades, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, simply to go and make a movie, at a lower price, more than likely to see if he could do it. On that level, he succeeded. However, the film itself definitely is not. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that the movie is a failure because there was something I liked about it. Even though the story of the film got in the way, and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to direct, not being a theater man), his ability to produce and capture some great images gets his seeds in this film. . Sometimes, there are some close-up shots and quick shots in suspense / action scenes that are eye-catching. Unfortunately, this is all I can say about the movie. Although there are a couple of "name" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances in general are boring and very routine. <br /> <br /> In fact, that is the main disappearance of the movie for me; Every time I see a Kubrick movie, including his previous film Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can tell who made it, since his style was distinguished, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It was not "artistic", as I could have imagined (which is often the case with new directors such as Scorsese and Spielberg), but when I saw this film, I not only felt that it was not Kubrick, but that it seemed a lot to me. from the time I was watching a B movie (or even C) by a director, that time I forgot it, not quite "Ed Wood", but it was very close. The music is as standard as it can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to have less attention. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, as others have said and I agree, this is a "doodle pad" of an innovative future, showing some shots and some attention-grabbing editions (the best scene in general is when the soldiers take the silly girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend, except to those, like myself, who just saw everything for Kubrick (or, maybe, I have to watch every war movie of ultra low budget never made), if only out of curiosity.
