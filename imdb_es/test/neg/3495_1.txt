I had gone to the cinema hoping to see a great movie based on all the word of mouth and great recommendations. By the time the opening sequence began, I knew I was in trouble. Music and credits tried so hard to evoke the emotion that I wanted to throw up. all I got from this movie was a clich√© of characters, a dialogue created and a non-emotional script. The director / writer Paul Haggis' has managed to get excellent reviews with his manipulative and honest writing, but he does not fool me. Some performances were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is a little overrated but he was decent. The ridiculous was too much in the nose. he must stick to rapping. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression of what ever. I do not find anything interesting about her. Sandra Bullock is always the same in all the movies, that's fine. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Philippe was also fine. but as for the script and the bad direction, this is one of those movies that is so annoying that I took the time to write about it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, what a waste of time.
