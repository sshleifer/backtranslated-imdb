Supposedly, a film about a magazine that sends journalists to investigate UFO reports with a more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole thing and the other an Australian, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the nonsense of UFOs. Everything is silly, some kind of money that makes snowshoes. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this movie is really a hoax and a trap to promulgate the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one that I've heard before. . This is an ad hoc explanation that, in itself, is not biblical at all, but is invented by certain modern theologians who can include anything in their mythology. The paranormal? It is real, simply demonic, unless it takes place in a Christian context, then, of course, it is from God. Simple, if it's not from God, it's from the devil, stupid! So I guess since the ninth symphony of Beethoven was not inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or so would the logic ad absurdum. <br /> <br /> We are informed that, since the Bible does not speak of life on other planets in the Universe, there is none (a version of the fallacy of Ad Ignorantium) and that God created the universe so great , so great to show us his almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's observation: if God had created such a huge Universe and would clog life on Earth alone, it would have been a tremendous waste of space. <br /> <br /> So, what are UFOs? They are demonic activities and they refer to the Christian event that will soon be trembling, to the breaking ... I mean the rapture. Before the tribulation, true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing massive panic, confusion, car and plane crashes ... whatever. Therefore, Satan knows that this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abductions that can then be used to explain this otherwise unexplainable event. Everything is part of Satan's plan that, of course, will prevent people from seeking God or Jesus and falling in love with the lies of the Antichrist. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc explanation also typifies the theological mix by explaining one mystery to another, In opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange and the mysterious as far as possible, first by the known , if not only for the known. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping directly at an alien. Kidnapping when a child is missing and not counted. I think I would first see more mundane explanations, such as the child having escaped, been lost, kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, supernaturals or Satan or something like that . <br /> <br /> This kind of deception or cheating on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often attracted to Free Rock Concerts, who can start with something innocuous and suddenly switch to music open Christian, followed by a sermon and an altar call. This kind of cheeky deception that one might think would be more Satan's ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be in its agony, these boys feel that anything goes, any tactic of deception or deception is acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which faces serious opposition from both secularists and confessions. like Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world that can replace Christianity, since Islam is much more cohesive and unified, and logically more sustainable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should offer little advantage to humanity, since it would be replacing a system of intolerant thinking with another. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's bet. The Australian atheist who is skeptical about everything that is said. Well, if you are right that there is no life after death and death is just rotting in the grave, do not worry ... but, what if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, the statements imply that reality is leaving. conform to nothing more than an atheist or Christian fantasy point of view, is a false dilemma or a black and white fallacy. Even if atheists are wrong, this would not necessarily make Christianity correct by default, or if Christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, therefore, materialistic atheists are correct by default. <br /> <br /> For all of us We know, the spirituality of Native Americans could become the best description of the ultimate reality and we could all have used it if we had wanted to treat the Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This movie should have the correct stamp in the box: Caution: contains religious propaganda and has no informational or entertainment purposes.
