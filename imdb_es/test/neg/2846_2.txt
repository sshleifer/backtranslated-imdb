Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of the handsome Hart Bochner. One afternoon, she arrives home, calls him "darling" and prepares a drink in silence, only to discover that he is angry. The minutes go by as she obediently holds up her frown. Suddenly, she gets angry, accusing her of infidelity in the total absence of reasons to do so, calls her the word C, hits her head against a cabinet, hits her and pushes her to the second floor. Balcony, breaking his hand and a couple of ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital where, she reveals, she is deaf, although we realize that she reads her lips perfectly. This avoids all the discomfort associated with an ASL interpreter or the fact that she utters words in a mock language. <br /> <br /> It's fine. Let me expose the basic elements of the plot. This beautiful and devout disabled woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, her bank account has been emptied by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man who approaches her in a bar, it is believed that She has murdered her now disappeared husband, and is persecuted by two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other one seems not to like all women and is ashamed of his presence. The end finds her alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash, alone, tearful but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, an emerging questionnaire. There is only one multiple-choice question. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." Do not sound sexist. One could easily pose a scenario about a decorated military hero and a trained warrior who is captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escapes to take revenge and ends up with the woman he loves, whom he believed that Perdido long ago weather. <br /> <br /> The address is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from his point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses who watch her, that is, the camera, an echo of each scene in innumerable second-rate films in The stretcher he moves hastily down the corridor and people in a white coat, starched and festooned with stethoscopes, hover over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner has played several evil people in an interesting way, some of them are stupid ("Die Hard") and some are more than just rude ("And The Sea Will Tell") . His virile beauty has a kind of evil tinge. It would be too easy to cast him as a hero. Pleasant, intentionally insipid performance by Steven Weber as the dumb cop, perhaps the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Its range of action is limited, but it is in full screen here. What makes it an object of interest is its almost stereotyped beauty. She is like a high school dance queen. Very feminine Of course, she can not help it if she slips or moves her hands so gracefully. Nor can she do anything for his nose. For most of its length, it is perfectly normal and attractive, but at its tip there is an outward bulge that follows the natural flash of its nostrils. The tip of that nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie - Pfui.
