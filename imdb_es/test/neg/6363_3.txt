I did not particularly like the Sliding Doors or Twice on a Yesterday, so I certainly did not have this bad second-rate excuse for those movies. An idea that has been made to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is of poor quality and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity simply to get a grade of R and certain scenes that simply were not necessary, but were there to push the limits (I do not really need to see a child urinate or fight with a diaphragm, especially when they have absolutely no connection or use in the film). <br /> <br /> The performance was also very poor, the only actor I found least satisfactory was his daughter; The rest were two-dimensional and quite incredible. The people I saw this left the room in half; I managed to finish it, but not without a quick shipment through part of it. <br /> <br /> In general: there is nothing new here, it is a generic and boring movie. The few funniest moments are overcome by fools or stupids. This would be boring even if it had not been done before. If it was not a rehash, I would rate it as five, but even for an Indie movie it was missing a lot, and as a rehash it also loses its originality: 3/10.
