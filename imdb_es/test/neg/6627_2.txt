Or at least forced retirement! This movie is horrible, horrible, terrible, bad, rotten, rotten ... well, you get the idea. DO NOT under any circumstances look at this piece of rotting garbage unless you have a death wish, because it is sure to kill you. (I only survived because I missed the first half hour). Carrot Top is a bad comedian and an actor even worse. I can not BELIEVE that there is someone to finance this enormous waste of time and money. It just shows that some people do not have scruples if they think they can earn a dollar or two (literally ... I can not imagine they make more than $ 2!). <br /> <br /> And someone, please. Tell me what possible motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (a moderately decent actress, above all, at least) had to sign on this pile of steaming manure. Was I so bored during that dry 3.5 seconds between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or did he owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (also known as Carrot Top)? <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10, and that's probably too high. I try to keep my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since I did not see all this, the contents of my stomach fortunately remained contained. I do not think I'll see it again to know if it's really worth a 1!
