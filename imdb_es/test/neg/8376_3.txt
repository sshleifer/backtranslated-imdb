Let me start by saying that I do not remember laughing once during this comedy. From the initial scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself as a neurotic loser, weak and self-absorbed, unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word or forming a coherent thought. I guess we're supposed to feel attracted to their fragile vulnerability and encourage it through the process of coming out of a deep depression. I suppose we should sympathize with him as he stumbles upon a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but actually provoked by his own contemptible nature. I did not get even the slightest hint that Solo ever had a redeeming character, which became disturbingly evident when he could not feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or flash of conscience gave me the hope that he would ever realize that his life is so miserable because he is a person with little life that is absorbed and self-pitying. I did not develop any connection with this character. He did not seem to mind, and neither did I. In fact, I wanted to break your knees at one point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the movie. It was simply an accessory to be used, neglected, despised, abused, coveted and eliminated on a whim. So be careful. Even though "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> The role of Scott Caan is fun and credible as the best friend / cad overexploitation. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic, I always want to see more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was deliciously repellent. Lynn Collins' role as "stripper with a heart" was well acted, but the character was at the same time absurd and clich√©, not to mention that there was no chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Barely. Comedy? If you say so.
