This is probably the only movie I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious and unintelligent movie with absolutely no artistic merit, and is a denigration for a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. <br /> <br /> In order to appreciate "The Stupids", you must take into account a little-known but very real maxim that the director Abo Kyrou talks about: "I urge you to do it. often sublime. " For any movie to work, the movie must establish and follow its own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, the movie may work. For example, when you see "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional comedy, it is a complete and absolute garbage; when you see it with the understanding that it's really a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" had not accepted the reality he created, the end of the air tank explosion would not have worked. But, many people think that "Jaws" is very overrated for this kind of reason, and they are not wrong. But it has its strengths, is not it? The point is that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it immediately, while others will never get it no matter how often it is explained. Jim Jarmusch made a convincing defense of "Showgirls" once, and even afterwards I still can not see him from his P.O.V. Although it does not mean that I am wrong. If you have the right mood when you watch this movie (and NO, I DO NOT WANT TO BE BORED, I'll put it in bed right now), you can enjoy the movie for the silly, cheap and useless late slapstick. Farce in the style of the 80s / early 90s that is. <br /> <br /> The defenders and those who hate this movie are right: it's STUPID, and that's the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted the idiocy of Navin Johnson. And because he takes that and runs with it, the film focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and define the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do this and would not use that logic correctly; Bad films are bad because they are invented as they go, while movies like "The Stupids" know where they are going, what they do and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can not defend the film From an artistic point of view, that's why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes are very shallow and the quality of the live action probably ruins what would have worked like a cartoon. But I can not deny that it is entertaining in its own way, and that is why I defend it. I bought it immediately, and I pity those who do not. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was attracted to this movie because of the delicious appearance of Christopher Lee (when he heard him say "Drop the record!" it would have been worth the rental price even if he hated this movie) but I was surprised to discover that, apart from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I never got bored or disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, due to their cartoonish context, were hilarious (particularly the airbag explosion). They were silly, but they were fun, and the film does not pretend to be something else: a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it has fun. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly why works.
