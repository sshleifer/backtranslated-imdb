This series is formulated and boring. The episodes are the same every week, simply with slightly varied settings. A purely evil character makes a bad action, Walker goes after him and ends up in a karate match. The villains are super stereotypical villains super cliche, the good ones are pure, honest and holy, and the lines of the story are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally invincible for everyone, except for the least demanding fans. It's certainly not Norris's best job. Your other work may be clich√©, but it usually does not last for weeks. If you like snooze-fests festivals of formulas, boring and repetitive, then this is for you.
