Well, what can I say? WHAT THE F ** K? There really is not much to say about this, really. The only way you would like this is if you, like me, like the bad and bad horror of what you laugh at. <br /> <br /> ACTING - VERY DISCONNECTED! Just watch the last scene with the leading actresses running! Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE Scam! But in a bad way! Simply horrible! <br /> <br /> Gore- Really not credible. In one scene they use one of those knives that have a cut piece that fits a part of the body, etc. By using this, with the addition of red ketchup, their assumptions 2 seem real, although they really do not. <br /> <br /> Predictable plot 'the kids get lost in the woods on the camping weekend' the movie got scammed from Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Scary quality killer mask if Clowns scare him, a little Incredible that someone chose this as his disguise though. The director obviously realized that all the good disguises had been used in all the other horror camp movies out there. <br /> <br /> TOTAL- 3/10 * / ***** pd- stay away from CAMP BLOOD II, this made him resemble the LORD OF THE RINGS.
