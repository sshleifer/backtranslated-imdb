An insane assault on the senses of the spectators. This is a mix of various films in Hindi and English, poorly made. The name is translated from a cast of multiple stars of the 70s, which also features the 2002 version. The story is taken from the 70s star 'Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy - "Nagin" and the visual effects taken ( a horrible attempt) of The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> In a school environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who confuses a fatal assault against her by two students as a collective effort by our heroes. It turns out that Manisha is a Cobra snake (Nag) reborn as a child in this life and her companion from the previous life, now a supposedly powerful form of all forms and forms (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge his rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Thus begins the wave of mad slaughter, where the avenging lover begins to choose each man in the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. The effects are extremely economical: computer-generated skeletons, changing bodies and motorcycle stunts complete the farce. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Nagin includes Raj Babbar playing a Catholic priest who gives temporary relief to our children with more "" Medallion multireligious "correct from the religious point of view (the original Nagin only had one" Om ") Sunny Deol interprets the love interest of Manisha in her current life and the final savior against the powerful Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> The music and the songs are below average. <br /> < Avoid if you do not, cheap luxury fantasies.
