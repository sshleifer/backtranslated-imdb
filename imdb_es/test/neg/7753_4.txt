I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I have it in spades. She was lovely in the romantic scenes; Too bad Bill Paxton flew on autopilot during the entire effort. I almost lost my lunch when he pulled his big fat white man behind his flight suit to say "commit" to Julia. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Julia was very competent in French while watching her in 'Sabrina'. I saw 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia doubled her own dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film about a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American aviator. Maybe they wanted at least a familiar name for the British / American market. For my unknown eye, Julia's features could be passed on to the Belgians. <br /> <br /> The whole movie had a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War II. I imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the period of occupation than the French or the Norwegians. The wildest fight of all took place in the Balkans, where Tito's communist supporters adapted to the Germans. <br /> <br /> I noticed in another review that 'dbdumonteil' believed that Julia Ormond was an American instead of the current British nationality. Maybe Julia's acting skills were big enough to convey that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie several times, I suddenly realized how out of season, the movie is. It was established on June 16, 1944 when the American plane crashes in a Belgian agricultural country. The trees seem to be mid-autumn with many leaves and the climate is warm. People walk in light clothing and the grass is still green. There is no smaller trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The real plot of the movie was a disaster. Where to start? For anyone interested in the history of World War II, the film turned out to be a farce. The reconnaissance aircraft used was a huge converted bomber with 4 engines. These planes existed, but they would have required a mass hunting escort to have any chance of survival. In fact, smaller and faster planes were readily available and would have been much more suitable for the task. The vital code books of the movie would never have been taken on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete their mission, while the commitment of this information would have been a great defeat of intelligence. Even taking into account the premise of the film, the first items that will be removed from the aircraft would be the code books. They would have traveled to Berlin 10 minutes after the German troops arrived at the scene of the accident. <br /> <br /> The house of the Daussois, where the "Major Brice" took refuge in a farm where no one had the least interest in agriculture. The food would have been very scarce in Belgium at this time. The Germans would have required substantial amounts of locally produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American aviator. Anyway, there would not have been any fuel available to run it. <br /> <br /> The twist of the plot where Henri Daussois turns Americans out of jealousy is pathetic. He would have had to reveal everything he knew about resistance in order to live. He would have had to function as a double agent to thwart any effective opposition. The woman on the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> The 'Brice Mayor' was caught in civilian clothes towards the end of the film. That made him a spy under the laws of war and subject to execution without defense. He would not have surrendered docilely to face an unhindered interrogation by the Geneva Convention. It is better to force them to kill him and forgive his friends if possible. <br /> <br /> I have not read the novel on which this movie is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows a lack of abysmal development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, screenwriters could easily have produced a script that would not miss this opportunity to offer a much better movie.
