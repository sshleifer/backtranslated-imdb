Well, of course, everyone has the right to express their opinion about one thing ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, 1968, student demonstrations, general strike, youth, ideals, love, etc. I'm sorry but I did not feel LOVE, ROMANCE. A lover who is fine that his girlfriend goes to bed no matter who. That's love ? But not only that, the film is very long and, for no reason, I had to stop seeing it several times because I simply lost interest. I waited for something to happen but ....... NOTHING. The only thing that impressed me during the movie: the gypsy violinist playing in the streets, yes, that was good. I do not think that art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and waste of time!
