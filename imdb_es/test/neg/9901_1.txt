What a disaster, and I do not mean the "destruction" in the title. I could continue with the hackneyed plot, the terrible effects, the cast (really remarkable) making a face while delivering the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there were no palms in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I need ten lines to post this in the IMDb. Well, I think a DVD release with shots could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal the favor he was asked to appear on this thing. Maybe Dianne Weist shows us the bag of money she must have taken to get her involved. Maybe the executives of the CBS will apologize ...
