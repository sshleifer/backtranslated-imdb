This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. I guess the plot works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions these characters take are incredibly STUPID! Like, incredibly stupid, not sensitive until the ninth grade! Basically, the whole movie consists of capturing these 4 idiots, repeatedly, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. It does not make any sense and it's not entertaining at all. Stabbing yourself in the eye is more rational, and probably more fun than seeing this. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** The end is hilarious !! The only good part of the movie! I almost died laughing at the end! All that stupid movie, and it ends with the silly girl who is sent in a cage to white slavery in Asia! Fun! I thought it was a totally incredible ending to a really horrible movie.
