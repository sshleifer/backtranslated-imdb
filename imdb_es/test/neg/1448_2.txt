The Power began to look promising, but soon it became boring and tedious to see. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it. The idea is "decent enough" and this movie would have been quite entertaining if it had been done better. However, after the first ten minutes or so, it soon becomes boring; We do not have good death scenes and we have to listen to a lot of conversations. In the end, one of the possessed men finds his death when he melts in front of two girls, but it is not very interesting and, definitely, it is not bloody. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend The Power to any horror or slasher fan as there is little to gain from it.
