As a fan of semi-films, I had heard about this infamous film a long time ago. I heard it was basically a $ 15 million movie about the tyrannical rule of the Roman Emperor Caligula, with hard pornography. What surprised me was that it was a porn movie, but it had great actors like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren. A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this movie came back to my head and, finally, my curiosity got better, I foolishly rented the DVD and I saw it more foolishly. <br /> <br /> In the first 30 minutes I was watching acts of sex and especially violence that would get an NC-17 even by current standards. Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man with a closed urinary tract and then pour gallons of wine and then cut his stomach with a sword (all with a very graphic detail)? And a scene in which a boy cuts his ass and feeds it to dogs (again with very graphic details) ... and this just rubs the surface. The argument for this movie from those who like it, seems to be the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses. When in reality what this film really is, it is pure exploitation. From beginning to end, you see only endless tortures, beheadings and all kinds of violence and derisive behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophilia, simply never stopped). There is no vision of Caligula in itself, which could have driven him to go crazy, the horrible childhood he had that made him a sadist when he was an adult. This is not a historical film, it's sordid. Even the porn in this movie sucks, and for a lot of this when I was not gagged, I was incredibly bored. By the time I finished, I was depressed, I did not feel like eating and this movie does the impossible, it can actually stop you from having sex. <br /> <br /> What were these great actors thinking when they realized? inside this. I read that the pornography segments were filmed after the main shoot was completed (which explains why none of the main actors is in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so bad). But still, and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. Right in the opening credits says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents." And the scenes in which the famous actors really participate are completely repulsive in themselves. Apparently, the director Tinto Brass wanted his name to be removed from the entire film completely, just like the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole were begging people not to see this when it premiered at the Cannes film festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is poorly lit and dark, as if the film had fallen into a swamp before developing, and that is when you are lucky enough to see a scene that is really focused. The sound is badly bent, a lot of the music is uncomfortable and the editing is tremendous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this movie. My advice ... Do not look at this, do not look at this, do not look at this ... for me tomorrow night I will see something lighter ... like DAWN OF THE SKIRT!
