Undoubtedly, this is the WORSE comicbook movie. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (1989). Yes, worse than the 1979 and 1991 movies of Captain America. Oh, yes, it's even WORST then the Superman IV movie: The Search for Peace, written by Christopher Reed. Sheeshh ... that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only acted in another movie and it was only on T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This movie is from "D". I had the opportunity to see it on the SciFi channel in 1997. I had heard it was bad enough, but that night I had nothing else to do, so I realized I had checked it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. It would have been better to see repetitions of different strokes. In addition to having the weakest special effects and worst acting I've seen, the entire script was horrible and was not well directed at all. Fortunately, a NEW Fantastic Four movie is being made, and I hope this version does justice to the heroes. I expected a new SPAWN movie in the future, but it has not materialized yet. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this movie. If you see it televised by cable, take a look. However, be careful, it is most likely to change the channel after the first 15 minutes.
