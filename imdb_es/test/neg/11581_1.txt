I can admit immediately that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. And that's not saying a bit, because I consider myself a bit amateur when it comes to a fucking movie. But this is beyond the bad. This movie is so horrible that there is no fun anymore, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It is almost impossible to review this. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I will ramble on about some of the stinking points. First, the CGI has to be one of the worst I've seen. I can not believe this movie was made in 2005, the CGI reminds me of something I could have seen in Babylon 5 when CGI was new and new. It is poor beyond belief. Second, all the actors seem to belong to the worst type of daytime soap operas. And looking at their resumes, I see that I am right ... Third, being able to breed huge reptiles is not comparable with the other technology that they invented in this film: the gun without recoil with infinite ammunition! Seriously, Michael Par√© shoots 100-200 times without reloading in all other scenes ... As if that were not enough, there are also planes that change shape! At first they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are completely different, and in the third scene they are again F-16! If you are buying archival material, do not mix it like this. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there's a lot more to say, but I think I'm going to stop. Everyone understands what I am saying. Honestly, I did not think that this type of film was made anymore. It's like something Ed Wood would do. Completely ignorant of quality, no matter how you see anything ... It's almost incredible in everything that is horrible. If I could give it 0/10, I would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. That is all.
