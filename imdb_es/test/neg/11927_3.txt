The animated series of science fiction of MTV "Ã†on Flux" comes alive with Charlize Theron playing the main character, a freedom fighter who fights against oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 thousand years in the future. For her last mission, she was sent to kill the city's leader, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but discovered secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux is in the category of good premise, mediocre execution. An interesting story, however, the movie was a bit boring. Many people say that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that is not true at all. It can be a disappointing movie, but at best it's an average movie. I've never seen the animated version of the movie, so I can not compare the two. It's probably better because they have the opportunity to explain the story more. The movie is not so confusing, but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The performance was good, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems to be dedicated to the movie. The rest of the cast also offers decent performances, such as Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it is taken too seriously. It takes the same serious tone throughout the film and that becomes a bit exhausting. There is no humor and the movie becomes a bit boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the movie is so serious, the dialogue sounds corny and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but that's not really about the movie, so do not expect just an action movie. The turn at the end is not amazing, but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a little weird but they still look pretty and interesting. The images were also done well, so the movie at least looks good. Therefore, the film can be a case of style on the substance. Interesting to look at, but it may not attract attention for a long time. In the end, it's not the best movie there is, but it could be a decent rental. Rating 4/10
