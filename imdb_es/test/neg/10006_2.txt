Being a fan of Japanese cinema, I expected more than this. I can not really bother writing a lot, since this movie is very poor. The story could be the most beautiful romantic thing in history, too bad it could not stand the horrible performance, the disorder they called the rhythm and the Japanese history "peculiar" standard. If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, arguments and twists that seem too "different", then forcefully stay away from this movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could have told you how this movie was going to advance, and that's not good in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: his role in this movie is really just a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you do not have to suffer for this movie waste. <br /> <br /> 2/10
