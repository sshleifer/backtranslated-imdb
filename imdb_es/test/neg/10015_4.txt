The earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are hiding in a huge mansion surrounded by lush lands, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with contaminated blood The Final Executioner is the story of one of its victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to end the legally sanctioned hunters, led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan has been trained to kill by the former NYPD police officer, Sam (Woody Strode), who usually walks around giving moral support to his student and turning him around for canned meat. Strode is by far the best of the movie, although it does not look good and only appears for about a third of the execution time. As for the story, it's a mix of elements from best movies and stories, such as Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner advances at a good pace and offers reasonable entertainment for action fans with less discrimination.
