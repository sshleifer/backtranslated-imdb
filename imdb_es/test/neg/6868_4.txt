I did not like this movie. For me, it did not make much sense. It was difficult to understand what was really happening. I did not think it was scary, either. However, I did think it was silly, even absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the protagonist of the film, which appeared in 2003. It was also, coincidentally, in "Silent Hill" in 2006, which she also hated. I also found it confusing and useless. "Visitors" is not that bad, but I think it's certainly below average. There is simply nothing special about it. The script is too confusing and there are things in the movie that do not need to be there, in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress, if she has more to work with. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
