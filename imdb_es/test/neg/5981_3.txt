What a waste of a great cast. I thought I would see it because it seemed like a good stoner comedy with many well-known actors. It turned out to be a meaningless collection of boring stories that intertwine about various characters with minimal connections to each other. The characters that start looking like decent people, but end up with no nice or interesting feature between them. Calling it comedy was also a stretch ... the only thing that made me laugh was the song by Jack Black, which was basically Tenacious D. I expected something important to happen, but I ended up with nothing but 97 minutes of my life wasted.
