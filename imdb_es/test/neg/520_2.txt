This is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems never to end. The acting was bad, the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a fifth grade science class. Dennis Weaver is a great actor and should never have taken such a part. My advice, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE!
