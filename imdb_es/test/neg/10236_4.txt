Time has not been kind to this movie since the days of sound transition from silence. The plot has a gangster who falls in love with a social partner who wants to help his violinist the luck he loves. Of course there are complications. The problem with the film for me is that it has not aged well. The performances are everywhere, with some emotional scenes that seem so exaggerated to be laughable. A late exchange in which Carol Lombard threw someone out of her room made me howl with her delivery of songs. There are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the film's technical limitations get in the way of true enjoyment. Normally I forgive, but this time I could not follow the flow (again, the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). It's worth a try with forgiveness (and remember that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)
