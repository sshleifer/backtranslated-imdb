I just finished watching this movie and I found it largely as a waste of time with little or no redemption factor. I do not really understand where all the positive reviews come from: the animation is clumsy and unrefined, the plot does not make any sense from the objective point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in what it is trying to happen. It goes off like an intriguing and suspenseful movie. I have never read the book, so I can not tell if the film was true, but as with most movie adaptations, it tries too hard to get as much information in as little time as possible. The result is a disjointed and illogical story that really does not allow you to understand or relate to the characters or, in reality, to anything. In general, I felt completely separated from the characters and the plot to the point where I could not worry about what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if its normal standard of animation It's a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
