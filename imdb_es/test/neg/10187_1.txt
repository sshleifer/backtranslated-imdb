This is the worst movie I've seen to date. 85 minutes of absolutely bad acting (half of the cast seems to be suffering from Asperger syndrome) frightening wigs, strange makeup (including tidal lines around the wig areas) and more sacred than the characters with more sacred than the dialogue that It makes you want to throw up. A comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to see it, is the overwhelming number of costume changes in which the unfortunate cast appears from scene to scene. Was this film backed by a manufacturer of desperately dubious pastel casual clothing catalogs? Was the cast paid in clothes for their efforts? They certainly did not deserve to pay with anything else! This frightful effort of a film offers a rambling plot in the first half, merging into an equally confused Christian arc in the last Bible. All the cast and production team must be burned at the stake, or at least crucified!
