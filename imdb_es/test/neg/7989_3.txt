"El Mago de Menlo Park" was deeply responsible for many things that we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the film camera, the electric . the automobile battery, the electrical network (possibly its most important but least remembered invention), the prefabricated house and innovations for the telephone and the telegraph, as well as the teletype tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is more than 1,000, much more than any other American inventor. <br /> <br /> But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He often had great legal struggles over the precedence of his inventions over his rivals. The best example is the telephone, where he was one of the seven or eight rivals with claims against Alexander Graham Bell. Actually, Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had devised independently of each other in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the receiver and transmitter of the phone that Bell did not develop. Still, it was part of the Supreme Court's huge decision of 1888, which was the longest decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (a single volume of its reports!) Written by Supreme Court President Morrison Waite, which, by the way, killed the poor President of the Court for too long to complete it. <br /> <br /> In 1886, Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of ​​power grids for large cities. This was George Westinghouse, inventor of the aerial breakdown of the railroad. The Westinghouse firm had received the help of a new inventor and Edison's former assistant, Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "alternating current", which was a rival system of Edison's "direct current". The Edison system was basically a straight-circuit electricity system. The Tesla system allowed the current to be changed from one circuit to another, it was actually a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to beat this rival with an advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with power lines. Edison from the beginning put his lines underground, so they would not be in danger because of the weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to leave his lines open, like telephone lines. When there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on the Westinghouse lines (in particular, an incident in which the technician was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified spectators in Manhattan's financial district), Edison began to insist that the alternating current was much more dangerous than the DC current that shone. /> <br /> One result of all this was that Edison helped some subsidiary inventors to acquire the Westinghouse CA generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself always denied having invented the electric chair, but helped several minor figures along the way. To read the full story, EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, by Mark Essig (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison experimented with cats and dogs (experiments that he liked to show the public). In the long term, despite helping in the invention of a new method of execution, Edison failed to dislodge the public support of the Alternate Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903 he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the cinematographic camera. It helped to "suffocate" a well-known public elephant ("Topsy") that had killed several men. He did it by electrocuting the poor beast with air conditioning. But all the murder is in the movie, and you can see it to this day. It's a sorry-looking movie; whatever poor "Topsy" had done was a poor beast, not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosions of sparks of electricity that show the death of the elephant, we realize that it will soon be over, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouths of modern film audiences. However, I am sorry to say, it is likely that he has obtained benefits for Edison: his description of the film in his movie catalog shows great pride in his achievements here. In 1903 it may have been an exciting entertainment for many Americans who saw it. One is glad that more people are horrified by this today, sometimes one can feel that the human race has improved a little.
