Imagine a new exploding version of The Defiant Ones with a black girl and a white girl joined together. Set the story on some island in the Caribbean where drug traffickers rule and the revolution has arrived. And make the black woman be from the Huggy Bear ladies' stable and the white woman be a diluted Patty Hearst and you have Black Mama, White Mama. <br /> <br /> In those waning days of the drive-in theater this article must have been a big hit of age. All the hot buttons of the seventies are pressed on this one. Even though both of them fill their clothes better and will receive some whistles from the men in the audience, nobody will confuse Pam Grier and Margaret Markov with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look at the new fish that arrives. Margaret is a rich girl from the state who took charge of the "revolution", while Pam is your high-priced prostitute who has been serving the local drug lord and got tired of that and tried to leave the island. > Margaret's revolutionary comrades ambush the bus that transports them from the women's prison to the city, but they get lost in the escape. They both have different agendas, but like Sid and Tony, they can not agree on which agenda comes first. For some interesting moments, the police, the drug traffickers and the revolutionaries are looking for these two inflated chain friends. <br /> <br /> Just so you can not think of the wrong ideas, the leader of the revolutionaries and Markov's Kanoodling partner is called Ernesto and is played by the Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole disaster was filmed in the Philippines that started their own film industry. <br /> <br /> Location photography in the Philippines is everything that Black Mama, White Mam, has to recommend. But if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation movies, this is one for you.
