I have no idea why I saw Ali G Indahouse, except for the fact that Salon seemed to think that a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for an Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never see that program since the movie is not funny at all. Comedy? The torture was more like that. It was just the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She was not in The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I'll have to check out Boston Legal one of these nights to see how she's doing in something worth seeing.
