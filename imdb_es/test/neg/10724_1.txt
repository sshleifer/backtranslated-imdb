How terrible to fail. Not only the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, George Segal's vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the influence of Jim Carrey, not only will star, but also produce this excuse tired, ugly and useless for a comedy. It could be taking the comedy to a whole new level, instead, it goes by what you can assume is a safe territory. Money, money, cracks, Christmas. But I am sure that this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's how I felt. Aware as I was of the desperate attempts I tried on the screen to be funny. And failing, miserably. It could have been a mirror comedy, scandalously politically incorrect, of the days after Enron, but no, that would be too high, too risky. What a pity!
