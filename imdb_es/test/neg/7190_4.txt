OK, everyone is so excited about this movie that I hardly dare to add a negative review, but I just did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say first that I saw the film in Russian overdubbing, so I will miss it. some dialogues, but not much. <br /> <br /> First the beautiful things. There are some funny moments (the Elvis impersonator, for example). The actors seem well cast, also the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the disadvantages of this movie. First of all. There is almost no story and in the end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So there is no drama or suspense. They tried to solve this problem with an emerging issue among the actors mentioned above, but that story evaporates. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this film are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous group. I am willing to believe that flying in some specialized doctors in the states helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the really interesting questions that need to be addressed are: who funded the campaign, what did they get in return, how was the opposition handled? Do you broadcast some commercials? <br /> <br /> So, what we have here is a film, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that can make the film relevant or just a very good political thriller) without a plot or subplot
