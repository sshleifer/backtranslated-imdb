I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love vampire films B. But this has almost nothing in its favor. Part of the performance is horrible, especially by 3 of the male protagonists. The story is not particularly interesting. In a relatively short time of 88 minutes, it still seems too long and you will find yourself quite a fast forward. There are a lot of kung fu attacks. It sounds great. It's not when it's done on a low budget. It becomes repetitive very fast. There is a bit of blood and blood, there is nothing to get excited about. There is a good job of cables where you can see the cables. It has some good landscapes being filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth the rent
