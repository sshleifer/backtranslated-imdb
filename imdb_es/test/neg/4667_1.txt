<br /> <br /> I liked some of Hollywood's blockbuster action from the 80s. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action movie in the 90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I think, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamelessly designed and achieves the worst clich√©s while looking to thrill the audience. The melodrama is so spicy and horrible that you can not wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several independent features led by teachers such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to get on the shopping cart. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetic of the great special effects and the precious and little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That's the norm these days and I'm beginning to wonder if there's a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems that they only use hacks and committees to write the easy scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grandiose and sincere human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can only think of one good aspect of this movie that involves Liv Tyler's father who does not even appear in the film. Aerosmith, the band of Steven Tyler, offers a theme for the film: a ballad that really rises and at least throws a little strength when the final credits appear. <br /> <br /> I cry for Western civilization if people like this Predictable, cumbersome movie. It is synonymous with superficiality, lethargy and diminution of the human intellect. I would even prefer to see the eighth Friday the 13th.
