This is one of those religious horror films that never explains why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than those of "good". We have here a satanic cult that can: 1) "move away" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill through dolls of small children, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a greater distance, and 5) cause drastic automobile accidents in which selected people become spaghetti, while others (children, in this case) survive unharmed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces of "good" "I can: 1) sit without being able to do anything, 2) run out of ideas, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) lose the time doing nothing, 6) reading comics while the dozens kill people, and 7) getting too late to satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror film, I have to assume that the world of that The movie is inhabited by God and by Satan, I also have to assume that Satan can not be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the film has a world order similar to Hell, in other words, where were the priests in this movie? Did you know something? The best thing the priest in this film could do is to guess that there are some witches, nothing more, to have read all those books in his studio. At first sight of the violence, this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically , only to end up in a major panic attack So, is this supposed to be God's contribution to fighting Satan? Ridiculous. Every good movie of religious terror has the powers of "good" equipped with some form of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least SOME concrete knowledge of how to fight against "evil". In that sense this movie is pretty idiotic. As is the casting of the Martin droll to play the high priest (!) Of the cult. There is very little threat or astonishment to see the peculiar Martin lead a satanic ritual. I mean, it did not have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but could not they have found someone who looked less funny? Also, why does the couple return to the city after their car has been left out of the race? After his "friendly" meeting with the people of the city, no healthy person would have returned; They should have continued walking The man's explanation to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is that "who knows what's in that direction".
