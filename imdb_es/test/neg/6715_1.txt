I sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why is a horrible script like this approved in the first place? It is not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it is not adequately explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> Having the wife explain the plot through flashbacks is very bad, bad, bad. Having such a tight edition for the fight scenes is also bad! Such a fantasy edition only appears in the trailers. Everything looks cheaper! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian guys at the top of the movie? Who is the boy who is being tortured? Are you with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie did not deserve to be released in theater. But in the first place it does not deserve to be produced. It's a Hollywood joke.
