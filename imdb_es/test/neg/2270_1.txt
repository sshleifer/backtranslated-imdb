Comparisons between the 1995 version and this are unavoidable. Unfortunately, this version falls short. <br /> <br /> The casting has no inspiration and wood acting. One has the impression that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is presented as pompous, but his inadvertent nonsense that Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> The Musgrove sisters are so unpleasant, that one does not understand why Wentworth or anyone else would give them a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne lacks feelings. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the deep emotion they both felt to each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this case, it is difficult to understand that Anne spent years saddened unless she had read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the relationship of the main characters. <br /> <br /> In the scene in which Wentworth enters with Anne and Mary having breakfast, it seems to Mary that, as Mary thinks, they are only a little known. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth enters. (The first time you see it in years), the tension is dense. Resentment is coming out of Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost defeated. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth courts Lousia, it is as if he were really invested, the underground currents are missing. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger with Anne. He is flaunting his courtship in front of Anne, as if to say: "look what you left, I do not need you anymore". <br /> <br /> However, she still cares if she suffers, like the scene in which she asks her sister and the Admiral to take Anne back home, she illustrates. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels Anne's shock that she would care if she were tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that he still cares. In this version, he just keeps walking with Lousia as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The pivotal scene in which Anne is talking to Harville about who loves the most time, man or woman, is totally ruined. The actors are reciting lines without an emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads Wentworth's letter, it's as if she's reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Contrast this with the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at her second chance. We are there with her while reading the letter. The director had both actors read the letter and you heard both voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne's at first is incredulous and then evolves into joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what just happened. The 1995 version did not have to explain, we met and we rejoiced for the characters. The only thing that this production has in its favor is that it kept the plot of Mrs. Smith intact, while the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br /> However, the 1995 version included part of Austen's original ending. The scene in which the Admiral orders Wentworth to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to return home (which he and Mrs. Croft are renting) after they get married. <br /> <br /> This is a production to avoid at all costs.
