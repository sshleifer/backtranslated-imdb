I think Downey maybe was inspired by the new French wave. <br /> <br /> Who was not? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what you just created here was more in line with the new crackhead wave. <br /> <br /> A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no, in fact. In more ways than one. Including watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stand it after a while and I started to move quickly through it. It would have been wiser to have omitted it altogether.
