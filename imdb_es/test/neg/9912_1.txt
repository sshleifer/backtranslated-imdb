I hoped that this film was originally assumed before the election. The last chance for CBS to launch an excavation of Bush. This movie was horrible, but I'm still watching it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS got the same people who "provided" the memo to make the semi cut in half sequence. What's wrong with the story of the bad boyfriend? Can you think of acting or dialogue as an Ed Wood movie? Whoever created this script, please do us a favor, stop writing. If you want to watch decent grade B disaster movies, see Earthquake, Flood, etc. Avoid this mess of a movie. Hint to CBS to avoid showing us this shit. Give us re-runs of CSI instead. Better acting and more credible.
