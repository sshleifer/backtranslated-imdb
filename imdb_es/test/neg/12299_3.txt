My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable television on a lazy Saturday afternoon, thinking it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. With this promise, at least, the film fulfills its function: its character is ineffective and adheres to almost all the clichés of horror films. Like the movie. A cataloging of their studied adherence to them would be an exercise to remember something that I hope to forget quickly, so I will not. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the false leads: everyone seems guilty, instead of just the two suspects from the start. The "discard the logical and the obvious, and what remains is" the rule of bad horror films works well in this case. The only surprise that had an impact on me was her final entanglement of the indeterminate ending cliché: Jane will keep her appointment with her rescuer attempt, who will tell her the identity (obvious to the audience) of the second plotter, prompting her to another game Round hysterical of the victim. Fortunately, I'll never know.
