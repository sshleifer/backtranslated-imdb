"Nuts in May" may be one of the worst movies I've seen. If Ed Wood were still alive, this would be the kind of movie he would be doing. To say that this movie is bad would be the underestimation of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of evil that happened; "It's so bad that it's good" or "It's so bad it's GODDESS." This movie falls in the last section. The unintentional little humor he has does not make up for the slow, hard to understand and boring majority of the movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Anglos Take a trip to the countryside for a bit of R & R and camping, there they met Ray, who will soon be Jim (I'll explain later), whose tent is next to our main couple. Throughout most of the film, the two protagonists go sightseeing on the beach, in a rock quarry and in other interesting places. Among these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism, the collection of fossils, the duty of an appropriate citizen and a proper diet, all I want to see in a comedy. They bored anyone who heard them. The dialogue is not only bad, but the rhythm in some scenes is so slow that sometimes I feel as if I was the dose. The scenes would be prolonged forever and just when they begin to accumulate and something is about to happen, the scene ends. Halfway through the movie, I thought to myself: "Nothing is going to happen in this, it's really a movie about nothing". <br /> <br /> The characters are annoying and repeat things constantly. In one part I felt that the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. The scene that I am referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it our two boring Britons play some music for us, in reality they were the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over again. The idea was to make Ray sing with them, but Ray knew, like us, that they are the worst composers known to man. This scene was more than tedious, for the fifth time that the song was played, I began to question the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words can not describe how horrible this movie is. The first thing that catches your attention is the unbreakable British accent that has the majority of the cast. Remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Times for 10. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, our tree hug, incoherent, gets into a fight with some of Ray's friends who do not respect the rules of camping. Our hero is so outraged that there is a climatic battle between our hero and the chief of the underworld. To resolve their dispute, the two men get involved in a stick fight. This is a fight of sticks! Now this is where the unintentional humor begins. I laughed so much for the ineptitude of everything I thought: "This can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this hysterical battle, our hero runs behind some bushes to mourn and the other man calls Ray and calls him Jim for some unknown reason. <br /> <br /> A fight of sticks, a weeping nature that loves 40 years. and a character name that changed 3/4 to the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> However, I was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes, which to summarize ends with a long catch of pig. . Why? who the hell knows At one point we see a pig grazing and the next the credits begin to play on the screen. One of the worst endings of one of the worst movies of all time.
