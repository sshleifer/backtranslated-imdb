This film does everything possible to capture that feeling of bad Canadian classic film: <br /> <br /> "strange" and hateful characters (some); "peculiar" city with "peculiar" people; a "quirky" cafeteria or restaurant (cafeteria here); Many pictures of Canadian things for postcards (things from the ocean here); Much mention of "I have to leave this city"; boos openly. <br /> <br /> And it is successful in all aspects. <br /> <br /> However, something to keep in mind. I could not understand if this movie was just trying to be an "extravagant" comedy after the North Exposition or something surrealistic like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. The editing of this film jumped senseless from one thing unrelated to another without rhythm or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we did not even know where we were jumping. Take, for example, the first shots of screaming at teenagers in a car. Who are they and what did they have to do with something? And this sub - uh - plot (use that word frame loosely) for children that seem to span generations. I do not think they really do, but the editing makes it seem like they materialize from a flashback, all of a sudden, to the current time. Hey, what did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. If not for the laughs. Or you want to try to get out of the inept edition.
