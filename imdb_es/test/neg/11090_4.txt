Julie Delpy stars in this horrible film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France in the 14th century. The film tries to break the image of romantic cavalry of the heroic medieval knight, showing a rather sad image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, whom his father told him to keep his mother safe and await his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. François murders him in defense of his father's honor. As a father as a son, François grows up and abandons his family, also to go to the same war. This configuration is in some way an explanation of the coming events, since on their way home, we already noticed that something is wrong with François. The war has not gone well, he has changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter, Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from the captivity of the English. She is pure of heart and they let her take care of the farm while her father was gone. In the absence of her father, Béatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens Béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. But, on her return, she realizes that she lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, including his own daughter. From this point, the film shows several ways in which François torments his family. Starting with humiliating her own son and ending with the rape of her own daughter, Béatrice. <br /> <br /> Prepare the film in the Middle Ages to soften the blow, as the viewer may say, that this kind of people Of violent acts were carried out in difficult times. And in fact, many films about the theme of Incest, such as "The War Zone (1999)" by Tim Roth, which are contemporary, were more impressive because of that. <br /> <br /> Delpy appears in this movie with several daring naked scenes In fact, she seems to be angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I got angry when I saw some scenes of animal torture. I think, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed to make this movie, which really bothers me. The quality of a film falls when real violence is used against animals. I hope this movie is reissued without those scenes of cruelty. Those scenes do not contribute much to the story of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is too long. The script is problematic. We did not get to see François and Béatrice before the war, we really do not get the answer as to why so much has changed. I would have broadcast this movie, however, I have to mention some scenes that made it worth seeing this movie: <br /> <br /> * The scenes of a small child who is capable of killing in cold blood are really shocking. I saw it for the first time in "City of God (2002)". Here, François, murders his mother's lover, while his father goes to war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The scenes of Béatrice that are raped by her father until she discovers that she is pregnant with him are really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns his cloths and cleans. She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with the hope of having a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * The scenes of humiliation of the brother in which the father pours the head of his son into the food, humiliate him and then complain about the war. Later, dressing his son with women's cloths. <br /> <br /> The film won the César (French Oscar) for Best Costume Design, I agree, the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the period of time. The location of the film is Château de Puivert, a true 12th century castle and a historical monument, located in Aude, in south-central France. Beautiful castle and mountain view, it really helps you to establish the period of this movie. The film was also nominated for another 3 César awards, but all were snatched from the hit French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Goodbye, Children", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Released as "Beatrice" in New York City, March 1987. It will only be screened in France in November 2007. I saw it on YES3 on May 3, 2007, at 5:45 PM, at work.
