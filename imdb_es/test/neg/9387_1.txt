With NBC's "Thank God You're Here," the network may be trying to replicate the successes of ABC's improvisational comedy, "Whose line is it?" in which the presenter Drew Carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast members invited to improvise scenes of some kind. On the NBC show, Dave Foley and his co-host Dave Alan Grier supervise a handful of notable comedians who must improvise throughout several scenes that begin with "Thank God you're here." He takes himself too seriously (why do you have to repeatedly remind viewers that actors have never seen the stage before?), Both co-hosts seem less enthusiastic. After watching the continuous sub-couple, the actors' ungraceful attempts to request some laughter, I wonder if the live audience is genuinely laughing at what is happening, or if they are also improvising. Wait for this time slot filling to be of very short duration.
