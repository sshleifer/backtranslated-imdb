Is it just me or most of the actors in this adaptation do not take age into account? <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave, although she is a superior actress, seems like she should be joining her children instead of falling asleep on the couch. (I would have loved to see Brenda Blethlyn in the part, despite her connection to the latest Pride and Prejudice.) <br /> <br /> Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only ones I felt were up to par. of his characters in Spirit and performance. Everyone else seemed confused or out of place. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I'm not very familiar with Dr. Who (I've only seen a few episodes so far) or I would definitely have soured this even more. <br /> <br /> Too bad Mansfield Park has not yet seen his screen (big or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to successfully balance all the complexities of the characters.
