If there was ever a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, then that movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong with basing a sci-fi movie on a sexy, sculptural female android? Surely such a movie could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately this movie is pretty useless. There are a number of flaws with this production, however, there are two basic problems that completely destroy the entire company. First of all, it is a comedy without comic snippets, or at least a movie in which the potentially fun aspects are presented in an incredibly funny way. Second, the title character is underutilized underutilized. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but in that case it was a terrible decision, since it is still easily the best of the movie. I do not think she really needed to be a great actress to achieve the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, what we have left is a lot of relief for the comedy, which is often made up of pointless jokes about the great sci-fi hits of the era like Alien, Star Wars and 2001. Written and nothing funny , and he does not even have a plan to push things. The story basically is about a space shuttle from the police that is sent to get a rock. That's! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept film was one whose plot could be described in a sentence. What he did not define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than one sentence, perhaps meaningless? <br /> <br /> This seemed like a sure winner, but it failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to fake Star Wars and combine it with comedy situations for adults. All he really achieves is to leave you cold and a little irritated at not being close to what it should have been. A Barbarella for the 80s, this is not it. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this movie ended, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a horribly violent and horrible way. And for that reason, Galaxina has derived a large amount of its cult interest. I just think it's a shame that Dorothy does not have a better movie to immortalize her.
