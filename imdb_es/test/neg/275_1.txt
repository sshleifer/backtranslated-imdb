What a ridiculous waste of time and money! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I am disappointed by Julia Roberts, by far, she is the most talented member of the cast. I think his ability to act truly led to the movie. Friends Buddy Boys club was a little too fake, and to add insult to injury, why bother choosing Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a movie. She lacks the ability to screen chemistry with anyone, not to mention that she lacks the ability to act. She lacks chemistry with the other characters: a kind of reminiscence of "America's Sweetheart's". She made the terminal "The Terminal". This movie is going nowhere, what a pity, please, do not tell me that "13" is on the way.
