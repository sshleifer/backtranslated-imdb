This movie is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced to the North American drama. The characters were all very weak, especially the little charismatic Goya and the misinterpretation of Bardem, who was only good in his classical interpretation, when he acted as a French ally. <br /> <br /> It's just another missed opportunity to have spent the money On a good movie. I guess it was not a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director should think a bit if the movie makes sense or not before losing that money. Maybe they do not get upset, since they have profits before releasing them to the movies. <br /> <br /> No more hope in the cinema ...
