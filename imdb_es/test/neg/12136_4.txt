Can anybody help me? I lost the last viewing moments and I do not want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I got right where they are in the train car and she says "what about that drink now?" and smiles. What happens after that? Is there more dialogue or action? Are you sure it does not end there? I was a little bored in the movie and I expected it to improve. I love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK television series in which he participated on some nuns? I'm looking forward to the name. Sean Penn was brilliant, Madonna ate your heart! Everyone else, in fact, the movie was a bit predictable, it was a 'spot a star star cast'. The end took me by surprise. I really thought that she had burned her boats ... if you're a fan of any of the stars, it's worth seeing.
