Without really being the worst science fiction movie ever made, or the worst I've seen, "Time Under Fire" is still way below average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as a story of X-Files, combining the mysteries of the Bermuda triangle with time travel. Very soon the elements of other genres (too many) are mixed, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a television series. Soon, 'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, not only mixing too many genres but also can not create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that help viewers remember the film until tomorrow. Acting is bad, and the rhetorical lines in the script do not help at all.
