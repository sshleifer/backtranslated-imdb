Although the movie was just the one, the closed subtitle was the best I've seen in my life. Most of the time the spelling is terrible and the subtitle is not synchronized. I use the hidden subtitles although I can listen well but I find many actors muttering. Also many times the sound track cancels the dialogue. Thank you!
