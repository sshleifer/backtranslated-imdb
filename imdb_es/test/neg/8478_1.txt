-So the weak excuse for a story in the generic loss of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but who can not make his career on the ground. His super hot wife is more successful and she does not seem to care that he is a loser, but the man is not satisfied with that and wants to get more out of his life. One day your dog brings you a magic mask that changes your life. Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask, he tries to recover it and that is the whole story. If that was exciting to you, then someone needs to give you some water to wake you up. <br /> <br /> -This movie is terrible. There really is no other way to say it and I just can not stretch it enough. The only good thing about all this was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was sexy, but apart from her, there is nothing in this movie that is worth seeing. I know it's for kids and that's why it's so stupid, but what about adults who have to take their children to see this crap? Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrible shit. The original mask was a very good film that had a great mix of comedy and a great storytelling. This is a failed attempt by pirate filmmakers to take advantage of the franchise and, judging by the ridiculous BO gross, I guess the franchise will not continue anymore. <br /> <br /> -The director of photography must be severely beaten because the sugary colors of the film will make you feel like vomiting. If there was music, I did not pay attention because I had already pierced my eardrums to avoid hearing the horrible dialogue. Then there is the performance or at least what happens to act today. You could see an infomercial and see much better acting in that than in this movie, but I can not really blame the actors, since it is the director who is to blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to make another f ** king take If the new line is looking to start a franchise with this, then they need to improve their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will see any garbage that comes out <br /> <br /> - Bottom line if you are a sadomasochist and you love torturing yourself, please check this because it is painful to watch, but if you are not and you really like watching movies that are good, then avoid at all costs
