Overambitious and shoddy; and, sometimes, too dark illuminated. The DARK REALITY scenario is not even close to being original. Basement dark and damp. Prisoners kidnapped. Fearful survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends that she will travel with a backpack all over Europe. She does not leave the city. They take her from a rainy sidewalk, drug her and wake her up chained in a dungeon. Finally, she realizes that she is not alone and when she meets some of her fellow captives there are different thoughts about survival. His cellmates begin to die one by one. Can she gather enough strength and courage to see the light of day again? Others in the cast: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
