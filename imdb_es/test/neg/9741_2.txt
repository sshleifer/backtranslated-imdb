Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the sheets and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices that his trash is gone again ... there must be someone stealing it from the sidewalk. He goes on roller skates behind the garbage truck. When he finally arrives at the garbage dump, he is surprised to learn not only that "other people's garbage" has also been stolen, but that there is a secret meeting of an organization in the landfill. It seems he is determined to defeat the garbage collectors of the world. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster visit the police station and a Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, since Joan also disappears. Will they meddle in their problems? This is just a stupid movie, stupid, with the guilty of being the terrible script. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from books end in this movie. Arnold is quite nice, since Mr. Stupid and the other cast members try to make the movie work. The production values ​​are very high, with the dog and the cat belonging to the Stupids that add a little strength to the film. But, everything is in vain, since the plot is wandering and weak. Maybe, someday, someone will try to translate Allard's funny books to the big screen. So, if you love to laugh, rent something else while you wait for a new production and, of course, go look for the books too. But, stay away from being stupid, since anyone who watches this movie until the end could hardly be called intelligent.
