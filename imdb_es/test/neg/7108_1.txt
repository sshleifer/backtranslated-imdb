My poor Tank Girl, they ignored all the good things about you. Why does it have as little to do with comics as possible? I would have loved a movie that would follow the plot, or at least I had the right characters. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS US TANK GIRL? She is Australian, damn it! And she is not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either, she lives inside with Booga as a savage. He does it because he wants to live that way, not because he has to because Malcolm Mc Dowell is acting like an imbecile. And why are you taking care of those children? The only children in the comics end up being violently drowned by her, it is terrible that they have turned her into a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic comedian and Sub Girl is ... another sarcastic traitor with a strange sense of humor. In the movie, Jet is this little thing and Sub is this middle-aged witch. And Booga also does not look like or resemble what it is supposed to be. Although maybe the hot / human love was too much for the box office of the United States? The humor was so lame as well. What happened to all the things about the Smiths and the brilliant jargon they used all the time? What kind of line is "it will take a long time? I do not want to miss Baywatch". Even programs for young children may have better material than that.
