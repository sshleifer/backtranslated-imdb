After reading the most brilliant comments about this movie, I decided to rent it out despite some suspicions about the television movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm up with the movie and find merit in it, but I could not. The story never appeals to you or sounds real and the acting is superficial at best and ridiculous at worst. Everything in this production is amateur. <br /> <br /> It's always a joy to see him, Mary McDonnell can be the only artist to escape this disaster without damaging his career or reputation. I will not even bother to check the name of the protagonist. I hope he has done commercial again. <br /> <br /> Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, seemed to be channeling Katherine Hepburn all the time by appearing as if she were really drugged at home. Maybe she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If I can prevent a person from losing 100 minutes in this gut, I will feel vindicated.
