Okay, of course, this movie will never win an Oscar. Citizen, this movie is not ... BUT why should each film be examined? When was the last time you saw a movie that was funny, not because it was good, but because it was silly? Does not someone remember Roger Corman, king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. Just enter without waiting to think, and get ready to throw popcorn to the screen.
