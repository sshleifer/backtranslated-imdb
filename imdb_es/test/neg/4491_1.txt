I suspect that this board will soon be filled with comments from overly emotional people who praise "Dear John" as a "pearl" and a "roller coaster" and all the other empty words typically used by the audience of this film. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not the target audience of this movie, but I do not dislike romantic dramas, as long as they're well made, so here's my objective view of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not good. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot twists, the development stagnates where it should have been moving (right in the middle, to be precise), and as for the end ... it almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said: " Hey, let's shoot a very fast last scene, put a little sentimental soundtrack on it and end up like that. " Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfried could not save this. Channing Tatum also gave a good performance, but only much can be done with a faulty script. <br /> <br /> Speaking of music, it is unbearably predictable and silly. From the folk folk singer, smoky and irritating voice singer (probably chosen to attract the majority of university-age girls who will go to see this film) to the "shining string and piano" combo that is used excessively, only It bothers who pays more attention to the film as a whole than to their own "feelings". The movie has a good start and the biggest conflict that throws us into the second act was promising. This was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolds. Then the movie just dropped the ball. Beyond that, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it does not work the way it should. If you want to see a really moving movie about the prolonged love you expect to meet, go see "Notebook", which was really excellent.
