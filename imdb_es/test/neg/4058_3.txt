"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad essay to make a sequel in the course of a year. The first movie was cute, mimosa and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing in a basketball team is pretty far fetched, but he challenged to do enough stunts to save the concept. Even human history had some explanation. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. And the audience also gets emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for the badly made sequel. It's terrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes good ideas and turns them bad. The guy who changes the main plot in a way, this time, the K-9 plays football instead of basketball. Do not worry about how much time you spend thinking about the subject, for the benefit of a doubt, you enter with an open mind of an attitude you have with a movie like this, there are no positive thoughts when it comes to making a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eight grades. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. In the first film, human history involved him losing his father in a plane crash, with which the audience can relate, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating once more. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, do not like anything. Why? If I were in your place, I would love to have an additional father in my life, especially one so good. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him and became a local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The history of animals is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school soccer team, the Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like some of the funniest Home Videos in the United States, they can even catch a ball without stumbling or plummeting each other. Then, when Bud shows up one day, he shows that he can play as a receiver for them, and he is without a doubt the best player on the team. <br /> <br /> Buddy is extremely cute in his football suit. Oh, he is enough to melt the heart. The dog is the best in this movie too. Too bad he did not do enough stunts for him to draw attention to the fact that no one asks questions about a dog playing on a school football team. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad subgroup. They conspire about Russian circus workers who like to steal amazing animals, of course they try to catch Buddy. But their weak minds are governed by animals and end up making what seems like a "Home Alone" scenario. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more ridiculous than the first one too. . The Russian kidnappers add a lot of lamebrain slapstick that, I must admit, made me laugh, at the stupidity of all this. There are too many sequences that detail the nature of an inflation and very few scenes that represent the real reason why people will see this movie: to see a dog playing in football. <br /> <br /> The performances were also quite embarrassing. I liked the presentations by Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the degree of acting in general would be equivalent to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments near the end by a couple of football players, but that's not worth mentioning. Will the children enjoy this movie? Maybe, but they will even get tired when the felt arguments become too long and deep. Most likely they will complain that the dog did not have enough time on screen, and that they will stop the quick script change and protest against boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash compared to origami to "Air Bud" , as I did. <br /> <br /> I guess they'll think the dog is adorable.
