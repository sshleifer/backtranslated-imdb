Anyone who pays to watch the Troma films knows and appreciates what they will get. Having said that, I did not think it was possible to make such a bad movie, and still be convincing. I found myself looking only to see how much it could get worse before the end. First, it's an Indonesian action movie with a leading American character who looks and acts like the bastard son of Christopher Lloyd and Rambo's "Taxi." He puts up signs of himself dressed as Sly's "Cobra" all over the place and even has a custom shooting range (with action cuts from his biggest enemies) in Jakarta, although he's in the CIA and just arrived days before. There is a lot of action related to the use of weapons (there are no flashes in those M-16, only sound effects), motorcycles (that go through the walls), karate (where nobody makes physical contact) and even some sex (where all the actors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should be at least reasonably plausible, but not here. It involves the most dangerous drug cartel in the world that strives to find a "drug detection device". Why would they need it? That never reveals itself, why not kill the drug-sniffing dogs? It does not make sense, but, it is taken seriously. You have to congratulate the actors because they really seemed to think that this movie would make them all famous and they tried to "act". Better line? "Now dance to your grave, dirty slut! Best scene?" Rambo jumps to a flying helicopter, pulls out the machine gun from Baddie's hand, come on, fall, shoot a helicopter as it falls, the helicopter explodes, the mannequin pulled on the water F ** king genius If you can not appreciate the garbage, do not look at it If you can, it's great One last thing, did I mention that it was run by the three Punjabi brothers?
