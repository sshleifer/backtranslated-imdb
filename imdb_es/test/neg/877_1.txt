While I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a movie for girls if it's okay. This however is beyond the bad. You have the history of the book, the girl is divorcing, the boy with problems appears. The magic of BOOM happens and his demons are banished when he realizes that his life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now, although I can believe that such things can happen, I am not an idiot. It would not happen during a geriatric weekend, it would take time. However, here the producers know that they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the changes of the two to happen, I suppose that one night of blows and one night of grandparents and grandmothers who go like dogs in heat could be enough if you thought romantic novels were the gospel ... but most people do not. <br /> <br /> Now, if that is not enough ... the producers remembered that a movie for girls needs to make the spectator cry ... Well, they tried to make you cry when the two older adults got nervous because they failed ... so, how could they hit you again? Why I know, kill one of the characters for no reason, except that a random death will surely cause a tear ... and now allows the teenage daughter to magically link with a heartbroken mother for no reason. besides the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal, but who cares). <br /> <br /> So there you have it ... girl find child, child find love, death finds the child and mom cries ... What a movie is not.
