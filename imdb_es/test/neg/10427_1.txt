And I've seen many movies. I saw this in the theater in 1989 and to this day I remember the sick urge to go out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of cinema, this film has nothing to offer you. It is above all a pathetic showcase for the writer of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. When we see the progression of Belushi's life on the screen, Woodward appears in the film as a ghost character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing over him and weakly utters "Breathe for me, Woodward." There are too many terrible things to mention all of them, the least of which is the opening that Belushi has by jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named "Angel". I'll leave it like that.
