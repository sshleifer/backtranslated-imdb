When Hollywood is trying to understand how an "intelligent person" is, they fail so miserably, finding it difficult to put words in the mouth of the supposed "genius". <br /> <br /> Correct, any genius walks around trying. Rub in your superiority in each case. Sure, they hang in bars and choose fights? It is not as if they were autistic nerds (generalizing wildly) that they never tan. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are a genius, you know everything about Mathematics and History and Politics and, of course, you are constantly aware of the current events and an exhaustive analysis of them. Because these things, like, they all go together and things, you know? <br /> <br /> In addition, you walk with a smile all the time. You are just a presumptuous child of one who knows what, that's all. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you smoke, like someone who never smoked before, but you smoke because it's like cool things, you know. And you are different That is understood. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight? You're a bully A bully who finds time to study 10,000 books when he does not lift weights. And when he does not smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regime. <br /> <br /> And you go out with a 30-year-old college student? Minnie driver Well, I'm not even going to comment on Matt Damon. Team America has already hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dream of a Beavis and Butthead type student (in other words, 95% of them): "Yes, that's how it would be if I were a genius". But stupid people and stupid authors in this case can not imagine the lives of geniuses.
