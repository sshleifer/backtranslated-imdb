They even die hard. John Wayne fans will have to admit that this movie is a disaster. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is behind the gang that killed his parents, led by half the Apaches, half white renegades of Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), posing as a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many plot points to tell, but those that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) handcuffing a Zanti captured around his boot, so everything Zanti has to to free himself is to remove his boot Tobin's friend, Dusty (George, pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife thrown in the back and returns as new to the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin mounts an improvised log canal through a drainage channel surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and without his mark, he chases (actually goes after) Zanti on foot through the desert . Zanti looks for relief and drinks from a puddle of water, but OOPS !, he did not see the sign on the well of water that says "Do not drink poison". When Zanti falls dead, Tobin resumes his pursuit after the rest of the gang, and captures the entire batch by blowing up a wall of rock that seals a secret passage to Dusty's cabin: how convenient. <br /> <br /> At the close In the scene, the new Sheriff Tobin is seen talking on the phone with the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), the daughter of Dusty, Ruby, who previously in the film was a target of kidnapping of the Zanti gang. Apparently, the studio intended for Wayne to get the girl in virtually every movie they made with him, since this kind of ending is completely predictable for almost all Lone Star movies.
