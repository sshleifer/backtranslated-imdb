One of the worst shows of all time. The show would start with smart comments that would be totally out of place and out of place. The fat computer geek was amazing, the beating of the bible, the bad girl, who are these actors? I've never heard of any of them, except Cole, who was totally amazing in the part. Every time he opens his mouth, you wait to hear: "You see children ..." Removing the plug was a murder for this horrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this show makes a slug like Ice-T more credible as a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.
