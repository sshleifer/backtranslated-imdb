A pretentious horror movie that looks like a telenovela about a drug that sends you to a fantasy world where strange creatures hide. The film has some good images, but its strange mixture of what is real and what is not, is not going anywhere. Worse still are the vague pronouncements in voiceover of one of the characters. It seems to announce a more serious film, more significant, but I do not think that they have not even entered the territory serious or significant, so trying to sell excessively the meaning becomes silly. There's not much to say, people talk, take drugs, have visions ... talk a little more. It's not bad as much as meaningless and boring. Boring is the sin here and the reason why you want to avoid this.
