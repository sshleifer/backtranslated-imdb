Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest blockbusters and Never is a farce surprise of the Empire Strikes Back hero, Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the middle of the unfolding plot, Bond's mission becomes more of a Hollywood romp (at some point when Basinger enters). What about Klaus Kinski? I still think that Largo's casting does or, as is evident in both films, it breaks the story. Worst of all is the attempt to ignore the old hairy Connery as the sexual symbol that it was in the sixties. The 1980s was a sterile time for Bond films, although For Your Eyes Only is a great title. Sometimes, when I need to waste some time during the holidays watching this movie on the often re-launched Bond festival chain, I think the best attribute of the movie is its score, and I do not like it very much.
