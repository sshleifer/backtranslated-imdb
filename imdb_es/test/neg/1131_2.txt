In fact, it will be a blue Christmas if you submit your family to this. I loved the original movie, and this was not worthy of being its sequel. Actually, for all intents and purposes, it is not its sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns. Of course, that character turned out to be Eddie's hilarious cousin, but it's just not hilarious to be the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of a crazy relative who performs crazy pranks, along with Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was necessary in this film to be a success, and it definitely was not there. As far as I'm concerned, a movie is not a "Vacation" movie unless the good "Clark Griswold" is in charge.
