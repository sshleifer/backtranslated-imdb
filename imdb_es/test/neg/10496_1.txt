I saw this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent, otherwise there would be no way to have seen it until the end. The first scene in which a group of vampires with very bad wigs apparently electrocuted with several slow-moving weapons handled by an even slower Van Helsing aspirant ... in black and white ... with voice-overs, marks the rhythm for all Rest of the movie. The fight scenes seem ridiculous, the dialogue would be funny if the performance was not so bad, what goes through the plot does not make sense, and the production values ​​decrease (from the fold of the hero's Spike layer to the Cheap cheesy wizard's cloak, his leading vampire moves around). <br /> <br /> I've seen some bad movies (check out The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of all time .
