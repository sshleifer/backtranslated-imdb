The director Godfrey Reggio must be a charming and persuasive man for this terribly failed project that has seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resounding in his two previous Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, heads of laughter, etc., are mixed without any purpose. The parade of banal images is mostly generic actions of Getty Images et al, and hard-drive digital manipulations are amateur in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Could have pointed out that applying a solarization filter on almost all the paintings was a VERY BAD idea? The raw loop, the layers and the distortion of the images are reminiscent of a first-year Photoshop class. And to make matters worse, the computer animation sequences are more ingenious than a 1980 Wall Street pie chart. This does not mean that the aesthetic improvement alone would have rescued this movie, but a little effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as a visual food for the music that accompanies it. I feel compelled to point out that Philip Glass's score will certainly satisfy his fans. It's not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what Glass does best with Yo Yo Ma's enchanting violin contributions. If you decide to watch this movie, be sure to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence. While you may already be familiar with Michigan's central railway station, once majestic but abandoned a long time ago, 89 minutes later, you will find yourself remembering this picture of the decline of the twentieth century as the critical point at which you should have directed to the signal to EXIT / press the STOP button. You have been warned
