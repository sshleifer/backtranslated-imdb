What can I say? This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are, really, horrible). The performance was amateur, the sets were boring, and the camera work was of poor quality and sophistication. This whole movie seemed like a final project for the university. I had to keep convincing myself that a teenager had made it look good. The most disturbing factor of the "movie" is that it is not even a movie, it is recorded on video. That was very annoying. Besides all that, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot is so basic that it makes my eyes cry. Not to mention that they steal at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. If there was a zero star, this movie would get it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scares this movie is how bad it is.
