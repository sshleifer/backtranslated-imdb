For starters, I am not a person who qualifies movies that I have not seen, nor am I a person who qualifies movies 1 when they do not deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic plot was extremely formulated, and while it was not great, the plot deserved a 5. The part that really bothered me was anything that made reference to swimming in the movie. I compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. There is no character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. A team of six swimmers going to something called "Nationals" and "regional" without mentioning how they qualify. second. This same team that goes to whatever this meeting was was, without swimming, a real encounter at any time of the film. do. The rival program goes from being a high school to a club team, to a high school and then to a club team again. re. In the scene in which Ellis is interviewing for a job, the placards show the achievements of the high school state and the locations in the nationals, however, the team consists of between 5 and 12 swimmers, depending on which of the 3 meetings are made. my. A team of 5 men and a girl win national / regions whatever. F. The girl wins an event of 100 butterflies for men. Sun. In this race, said girl beats two men of a team that the previous year was among the top 3 in the nation. h. The announcer changes a race from 200 breasts to 100 breasts back to 200 again in the lapse of time in about 45 seconds. I. In the final relay, the 4X100, which is swimming in a pool 50 meters long, sees a swimmer doing two laps. j. In this same relay, the teams anchor the crazed swimmers and leave the blocks, provoking an inspiring talk, which lasts approximately two and a half minutes, or approximately 3 times longer than the leg would take in a national match. k. The film begins in the month of July or August, assuming that Ellis was submitting the application before the school year began and that the pool would close in 3 months, so, assuming both are true, the swimmers went from I can not swim. to win national / regional, whatever, in less than two, since the pool had to be cleaned and the children did not start practicing for a while. l I'm sure there are a couple of hundred more, I'm just trying to block them from my memory. 4. Throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmer's time. 5. If you are going to have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras who know how to swim well. 6. The scene where the child is kicked underwater is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> That said, all the swimming scenes were too slow, the swimmers had a horrible technique, and the idea of ​​being able to qualify for a national encounter within three months of learning to swim is an insult for swimmers everywhere. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you still do not believe me, let me tell you that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I have. Once seen, and this comes from the type that Gigli has, Soul Plane, Hands: The Hands of Fate, Skullduggery and any other total amount of garbage that has been filmed. Please, do not go!
