Looking for something shocking? Ok, well ... the image is that. That is all. This film tries to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolisms and ends up being annoying. I'm not sure if the director's purpose was to present a profound message to his audience, or if he simply tried to scandalize them with blood, sex and violence. I'm thinking that it was probably the first ... but in the failed attempt ... it just ended up being a piece of artistic trash with lots of blood, some unpleasant characters and an excessive dependence on religious symbolism. If you're looking for an independent film to criticize for your attempt to use the metaphor ... keep that in mind. If you are looking for a blood film that will make you feel dizzy and uncomfortable ... here you are ... If you are looking for a movie that will irritate you until the end because you realize that in the end, the message was stupid. ... the movie was stupid ... and you will never get back those minutes of your life ... this is surely the movie for you!
