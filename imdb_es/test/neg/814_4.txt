"Jaded" offers a premise with potential, since it analyzes the rape of a woman by two other women and asks the question "when is rape not rape?". Unfortunately, the film seems to suffer from bad direction as it goes along with legal minutiae when trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of malicious and misrepresented characters only to end abruptly. "Jaded" is a lame material only for the tearful-eyed couch potatoes in the mood for a dark drama.
