This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that movie, I was a little disappointed to see this. He is supposed to have started as a kind of children in the nature movie, and merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean Tina Turner. One of the main problems with this movie is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter! Actually, nothing will ever happen, if you plan to see this secondary action movie (you can even call it that), be sure to see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet, both. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even the Thunderdome battle sequence is boring, Max does not even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the right way) and after watching this movie, it left a bad taste in the mouth.
