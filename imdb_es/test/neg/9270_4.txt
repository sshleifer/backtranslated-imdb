This is a very strange movie, with a nameless cast and practically nothing is known about it on the web. It uses a familiar approach for those who have seen the likes of Creepshow in the sense that it presents a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and combines them into a connecting narrative of the people involved in the segments that get off a bus. There is a narrator who talks about relationships, but their conversation adds nothing to the mix and adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well ... I swear I have no idea why this film got an 18 certificate in the UK, which would put it in line with people like Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist . Nothing here is even remotely frightening ... there is no gore, sex, nudity or even a bad word to animate things, this is the kind of thing you could expose on children's television and no one would dare. I can only think that if I had obtained the rating I really deserved (a PG) would not be dead to a horror fan, so the dealer probably slapped BBFC until it gave way. Anyway, here are the 3 stories in summary: 1. A man is dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his girlfriend. 2. A man who lives in a dirty apartment is understandably frightened when a living organism evolved from his six-month-old tuna casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service ... that is, until she starts acting strangely ... And there they are. Some of them are quite funny due to their extravagant facilities (my favorite is number 2), but you have the feeling that they were intended to) frightening and b) morale plays, unfortunately they fail miserably in both aspects. To summarize then, this movie is a dark curiosity ... for very good reasons.
