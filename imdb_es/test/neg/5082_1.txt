Frankly, I'm surprised to see that this movie is receiving relatively good reviews. I will be completely honest and I will say that the only reason I got over it is because of Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons particularly related to his acting skills, although I believe that in recent years he has proven to be a better actor than his first leading roles in the late 1990s indicated. <br /> <br /> As for action / suspense movies, this movie fails in almost every respect. The acting is fine, I suppose, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes little sense, a fact that the filmmakers try to hide by adding absurd references to the theory of Chaos, as if convincing anyone that the film is really "smart" '- but, again, judging by other criticisms, some were. Do not be fooled: the script is a boring mess, derived and no other element of the film makes up for it. It is likely that Wesley Snipes has never had a less interesting role in a movie, and Statham is a completely boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
