There was a great hype of this movie and the advertisements made it look like it would be great. Sadly, like Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 embarrassment of the original Bring It On. There are shameless stereotypes throughout the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. Hayden Panattiere's performance was mediocre both in terms of performance and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally shrank with fear because the cast embarrassed me because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was so stupid. My recommendation to the creators of any future Bring It on movie is that you hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the "acting" of the cast was terrible and their lack of cheerleaders made them completely useless for the film. Only great character: Kirresha.
