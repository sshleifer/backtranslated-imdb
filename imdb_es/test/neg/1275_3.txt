I may not do it well. I mean the movie. It does not make me happy or what I have to do. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this is a simple family movie with children for actors. Just admit that: all movies of that type can not pass the barrier of 4 out of 10, no matter who is playing in the movie (for example, Antonio Banderas was playing in that kind of movies ... two or three of them they can not remember the exact account)). I got bored I almost fell asleep just because the subject is so clich√© and the actor's performance was so predictable. But I'm sure my son will love this movie when he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster, I found some fun or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were incredibly cute. The trick with the painted windows of the police car and the blows that the child received in the head for a golf ball ...
