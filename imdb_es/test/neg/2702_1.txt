As a fan of the previous series, I must say that this is, in the best of cases, a parody of a much loved series. First, the old series would at least try to follow some military structure. I know in this P.C. World is not what needs to be done, but do not turn it into care bears. In the previous series, Beachead was a hard soldier, now he is a teenage mutant turtle. Another thing is the flying tank, it's fine, it flies out from the base of the cobra and bounces off the helicopter and both are fine. Let's face it, if the next one is not better, this could mean the end of G.I.joe.
