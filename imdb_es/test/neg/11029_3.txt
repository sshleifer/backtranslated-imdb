This film does not have a very clear image of what it is or wants to be. There are some good bits when Stewart is on the screen and they give him some lines to work with. At first it works better as a romantic comedy, but the story continues towards a more dramatic territory and gets lost in the process. During the last fifteen minutes, the twists of the plot are just a series of dramatic clichés. <br /> <br /> The part with the plane feels like a movie left over from another spliced ​​movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why I can think about seeing it is if you want to be able to say. You've seen all the Jimmy Stewart movies.
