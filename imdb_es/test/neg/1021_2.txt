Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor efforts. A formula movie is not necessarily bad if it pays off, but this movie does not. It's a grueling mix of film clich√©s that can be traced back to a thousand different films of the past. It is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but action without direction, like a journey of the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (without explanation) follow them. Obviously, this was invented as an excuse to shoot and escape the scene that borders on the absurd, with people coming and going through the doors and running through the windows while shooting guns at each other. It makes you believe that someone told Becket that there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said: "Great, let's shoot a scene there." <br /> <br /> Do not even waste the rent money on this one. It's a bunch of fragments and random pieces from a hundred different movies thrown together to call an action drama.
