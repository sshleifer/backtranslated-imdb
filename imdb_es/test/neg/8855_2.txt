Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Straw! The BBC has lost a lot of time in masterly productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and HBO's Carnivale. Well, then the budget may be much smaller but the night before on 'The Street' was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotyped, insensitive and a great waste of time. Television (British television) is not as good as it used to be and is falling increasingly behind the American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of brutal violence on the part of the "local gangster". There were no indications that this man was "crazy" enough to hit a man he has respected for so long. There were no regrets when he did and this should not be the kind of character that would back down when Bob Hoskins called his son a thought, in a demonstration of "bravery". <br /> <br /> I wish it was more eloquent to express my disdain for this program, but I am not and, although I can not prove what I mean, believe me when I say that this was garbage, shock TV, that does not offer a real perspective of life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
