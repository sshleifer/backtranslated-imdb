The version of "Mame" by Lucille Ball is, in my opinion, one of the worst performances that has ever been saved in a movie. After seeing Lucy in her various comedies more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, however, this movie is a fiasco of incredibly bad casting, music and dance. Robert Preston is the only one who keeps the grace with a part small enough to pass if you blink. I do not know what she thought, and I can not imagine how she was advised by the studio or the director, but I actually shuddered to see this shameful performance. It could be very cruel and suggest looking at it to laugh, but it is too pitiful to even qualify for that. Do not waste your money or your time.
