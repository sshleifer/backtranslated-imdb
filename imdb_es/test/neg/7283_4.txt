HANA-BI has many quiet moments and a fairly slow pace. Unfortunately, during the many reflective interludes, the viewer is left to reflect on the recent scenes that have just been seen and many questions arising and bothering. <br /> <br /> For example, why did not the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was trapped in the sand and the tide was rising around him? No rescue was seen or hinted at. <br /> <br /> Could it be true that the Japanese police are so inept and inexperienced in arrest procedures as not to first eliminate the suspect's ability to search for a weapon? This detective-level Japanese police did not seem to have experience with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why does not the main character's right eye blink? Having a blinking eye distracted and had no explanation. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the main character spending all their money to have to borrow money from the shark lenders? He was not seen playing. Being a non-entry level government employee, your wife must have had full health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was the single man doing in the middle of nowhere in the natural park? What was the reason to be there? <br /> <br /> How on earth could the gangsters find the main character and his wife in the remote nature reserve? It did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And once again, how could the gangsters later find the main character and his wife in the remote mountain? Fuji resort? There was absolutely no clue available for these gang members to know which country the main character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the right specific time. <br /> <br /> And a third question, how could young detectives know at which feet of the Japanese coastline they will find the main character and his wife? The Japanese coastline must be vast. Were all these characters supposed to have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach: WHERE did it come from? She seemed to have no transportation or companions with her. And why in the world was he still trying to blow up what was left of his kite after it broke apart? This was weird. Unintentionally, Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and fluid and added a lot to this movie. Photography, images and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> At one final point, the wife was too nice to look at. Not once did he come close to looking like a sick person dying. She looked very healthy. In any case, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically ill. The husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly discovered gay man would treat a respected wife ... a love for friendship, but not a close tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed film, without a doubt.
