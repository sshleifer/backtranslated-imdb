This movie is one of the worst examples of hype. People who read IMDb's comments might be tempted to see this total waste of time, as I was, by fake tag lines like "A Backslide to the Horror of the 80s" and what does not. This movie stinks, from acting to the direction of history. Horrible, the whole board. And I really like GOOD horror movies, I'm not a snob at all. This sucks For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre The Beginning, The Other, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and I really hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre make ) Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes (re-make) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore does not triumph over originality or originality.
