..but unfortunately nobody thought of killing Van to save this damned production. The only positive thing about him in the movie is his pleasant singing voice ... Too bad the songs are mostly tasteless and sappy. Why did he hate Van so much? Well, throughout the movie, it looked like he was doing a sales imitation of third-rate Soupy Sales, with a lot of muggings, jokes and too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he "taught" the class: these children laughed at EVERYTHING they did. Wow, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the movie, it was the most obvious one. Of course, having John Gielgud (a charming actor) playing an Asian was ridiculous, as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother! The conclusion is that because of these crazy casting choices, the film was doomed from the start ... and the worst of them was the awful Bobby Van. Now in real life, he could have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material he was given here, he just wanted to tear his tongue out to shut him up. <Br /> <br /> Now I also mentioned the songs - egad, those terrible songs !! Frank Capra's original LOST HORIZON was a subtle delight in everything, and not a single song or dance number in the film. So, why did you decide to add a bazillion of songs that did nothing to help the movie? They only served to make it look like a sticky mess, like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a very sweet movie for children, which can not be enjoyed by anyone over 8 years old. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can eliminate these problems, you have the basis of a decent movie. After all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden under all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (although he certainly is not equal to Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was an almost perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection? Who wants to wade the molasses? <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie was included in the book "The 50 Worst Movies" by Harry Medved. Although I also disliked the movie, it was not bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mainly because it was a big failure at the box office and because it was published just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book is simply not one of the best selections of the "sacred room" of dreck.
