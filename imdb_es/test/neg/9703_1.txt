From the first shot of the film, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering through a field at dawn, invoking all the clich√©s that cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the rebellious female character with a strong mind in the drama of the time, I knew that I expected something. to make me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> Joe Wright seemed not only not to have read the book, but to be under the regrettable mistake that what he was filming was not really Jane Austen's subtle and nuanced comedy of manners driven through the delicate and gleaming social interaction in English art salons of the eighteenth century, but a sort of U-certificate from Wuthering Heights. Therefore, we treated each scene between Elizabeth and Darcy that was unfolding outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriate landscapes and often under torrential rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It deals with different negotiation strategies for the consolidation of the 18th century society. What was completely ignored, so the Bennet house was a chaotic and chaotic place where everyone shouts at once, runs, leaves his underwear in chairs, and the pigs roam the house happily; the dances of the society become country dances to the rhythm of a dance orgy in the Matrix Reloaded style; and they all say exactly what they think without the slightest consideration for property. <br /> <br /> The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the vacuum created by a society in which no one says what they think or want to say due to overwhelming consideration. for their property, and the tragic problems of their characters arise from misunderstandings and poor communications enabled by that gap without words. Therefore, both the brightness of Jane Austen and the factor that allows her plots, particularly in this film, to work completely were erased. The subtlety in general was not in any part of his film, he sacrificed himself in favor of an excessive drama that was completely related to the material and the performances. <br /> <br /> It was so obvious that I was trying to be a * serious * movie. The humor, which is Pride and Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and its appeal, was repressed almost in its entirety in favor of all this melodrama bare-faced, and when allowed, was handled so awkwardly. Pride and prejudice is a serious narrative that presents serious points, yes, but those serious points and most important issues are not only intertwined with humor, but are embedded in it. You can not lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bones of the story, and hope that the themes remain. Not even when you replace their techniques with your own mystical and false numinous hard-hand photography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature, sensitive and clear. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as a laughing schoolgirl with an empty head, and the second half as a schoolgirl with an empty head who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential feature of being able to see and laugh at everyone's follies, including his, his strength and composure, and his fantastic clear vision were lost and replaced by ... what? A lot of giggles and looking into the distance? Instead of being able to keep her head when everything about her was losing hers, she started crying and screaming at the slightest provocation, and she was not really furious either; No, these were attacks of petulant whistling. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the bounds of society and maintaining an impugnable property, the Elizabeth of Knightley did not He had no respect for the convention. In addition, he seemed to think that wandering barefoot through the mud in the eighteenth-century version of monkeys turned her beyond doubt into a strong and strong spirit, and therefore, nothing in the character as written or performance had to hold it up. An amazingly subtle and bland performance. In this search for weakness and weakness, Matthew Macfayden skillfully matched her. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet seemed weak, inefficient and permanently stunned without the wicked sense of humor and ironic detachment at the expense of the human relationships that make Mr. Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, especially since both were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of the emotional impact. Mr. Bingley was no longer friendly and meant well to the point of madness, but it was played as a complete delay for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing with Jane was so inconsistent that she could not have tried to do anything with The character at all. The script veered violently between Jane Austen's literal fragments, delivered with a remarkable awkwardness, and a totally contemporary language that would not be out of place in a modern romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Simply get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the anguish.
