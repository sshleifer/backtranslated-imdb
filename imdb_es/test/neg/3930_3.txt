A cheap and sad heist movie with a poor characterization, a lot of stoic emoticon underbite style (think of Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheese cliches thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few bad flying judo rolls executed in the style of John Woo. Even the squibs look awful. At no time in the process is it even remotely like America. Three old crooked cars are not a country. The Mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the end is like a murder for mercy. I could not get there soon enough. Even the robbery jewelry looks like the cheapest costume jewelry available. The horrible dialogue and irremediable exaggeration of all those who receive shots end a true loss of space and time. It is worth seeing if you want to know how not to make a low budget film based on clich√©s.
