I had a very difficult time sitting through this movie. Unless you really are very pro-adultery and you like to listen to ENDLESS people talking about their sexual exploits, I can not see how you can enjoy this movie. Geez, most of the main characters behaved like weasels and their bragging about their MANY infidelities became boring. About the only thing I appreciated about this was the FOUNTAIN scene in which the only character urinated and blood splashed everywhere because he had acquired an STD: BIG SURPRISE !!! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the general unpleasant nature of many of the characters, the sequel is VERY interesting and more realistic, it's worth your time.
