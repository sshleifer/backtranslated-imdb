The intention of Steven Seagal is worthy of praise, and his performance in this film is equal to that of many others, if he ignores the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two elements of the plot, which extended my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point. <br /> <br /> First, how is that a carefully designed variation on an unpleasant germ, whose antidote should be? In the same way that a large laboratory, carefully researched and designed, is it cured by drinking tea from a flower that grows high in the mountains? And what about the grandfather's family seems to be about the only people who know anything about this? <br /> <br /> Second, and this one really takes the cake: having gathered enough healing to fix an entire city, it would not do it. Do you expect the army to land the helicopter and start taking flower bags to all the houses? of this small city? No, instead, they decide to spray the flowers all over town and force the sick people to go out and pick them up again. Simply foolish, unless, according to the natives' belief, the power of the drug somehow depends on you having gone out and collected the flowers yourself. <br /> <br /> Add the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title, and you might think that my vote in this movie is really high.
