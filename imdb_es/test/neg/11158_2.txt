End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've seen. Confusing direction, serpentine script loaded with lame dialogs and open plot hollows, MTV style editing of fast shooting and poor performance in every way. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that End of Days is not visible. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action movie ridiculously stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic, the film dies faster, so End of Days deserved a lot of box office reception in its second week after opening in the United States. <br /> <br /> I will not go into details. Explaining why End of Days violates the law of film logic, but here are several problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the Devil comes out , the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. Without clicking, there is no energy gas manipulated to light the fire, nothing. How could this happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his annoying partner Kevin Pollack somehow magically come up with the name "Christine York" after examining the phrase "Christ in New York" taped on the body of a victim, directing the base of data on the computer and, viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who have been in contact with the character of Arnold later in the film turn against him? I laughed out loud when I recognized that the good stepmother turned into a wicked stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in Romeo + Juliet by William Shakespeare. His ironic transition from that movie to this one was absolutely hilarious, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> All explosions and incredibly huge shots. What did you expect in Arnold Schwarzenegger's vehicle? <br /> <br /> The devil took a human body composed of flesh and bone, but it is invisible to bullets and explosions as it heals through that body. Logically, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> When the Devil demonstrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character encounters the solid Christmas tree that is supposedly an illusion and * falls on him * physically. <br /> <br /> The devil is able to pierce the person's brains and twist a victim's head 180 degrees, but he can not kill Arnold's character as he always intended. <br /> <br /> How the parents died of the Devil's object of desire and why the evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all. <br /> <br /> In the sequence that is a steal of speed, Arnold and the object of desire of the Devil manage to escape from the meter Shock of the train by the short distance inside unharmed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire violently and die of fatal wounds seconds after the impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold suffers the brutal beating of the Mafia sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang on the wall, but the Devil forgot to take the time and the opportunity to kill him for reasons of convenience . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over. The body of a man, Arnold is suddenly his bodyguard? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold's recital of dialogues cringos in particularly ridiculous scenes like "YOU ARE A BOX OF SHARING WITH ME!" they are the perfect forage for MST3K, as Eraser did with the classic line "You are the luggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ridiculous. So are the pseudo-religious babblings about Christian theology that involves the end of the world precisely at midnight and the fanatical murderers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is very ironic that End of Days uses insults insults that abuse the deity while rambling on Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and frightening, and therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The indulgence of the director's excess is a factor here. Surely he does not know how to make a coherent action movie by the Air Force One scriptwriter, who was only forced to write the script for a large sum of money. <br /> <br /> Therefore, End of Days is a film without value and redeeming value, except for the campaign spirit: Arnold is the worst since Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
