Adenoid Hynkel, a humble soldier in the First World War, rises in the following years to become the implacable dictator of Toumania. Create an aggressive anti-Semitic war machine and cultivate a small toothbrush mustache. Does it sound like someone you know? <br /> <br /> From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this box of soap to urge Europe to take up arms and challenge Hitler and Mussolini. Since the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead, and no strong desire to get entangled in the civil war of Europe (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the United States, not the other way round). It is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic. <br /> <br /> The story involves, on the one hand, Hynkel, the vulgar and repellent, and the reign of terror that he ineptly presides over, and life in the Jewish ghetto where Every person is friendly, humane, Brave, etc., etc., Chaplin is Hynkel, and also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). It goes without saying that Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering. <br /> <br /> In 1940, the truth about the Third Reich was still unknown, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less. more than a perfect historical forecast, but even by the standards of the day in which Hitler is seriously wrong. Comedian and sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All it does is humanize it. When Hynkel, the soldier not very warlike, plays with the big gun and the plane upside down, he becomes attractive instead of despicable. As a dictator, he inspects the technical innovations of his subordinates that do not work (the parachute hat, the bullet-proof uniform, etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be left aside. In fact, the Hynkel regime is made nice and friendly by his clumsy body. <br /> <br /> In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this controversy badly considered. In the background, he was still a dinosaur on the silent screen (check out the humor, with gags like staggering up and down the semi-conscious street, or the pantomime of the coins in the desserts). The hero Schultz is destined to represent a criterion of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz is more like a character in the operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way credible that a figure of Schultz (if such had existed) would say to the FÃ¼hrer's face, "his cause is doomed to failure because it is based on the stupid and ruthless persecution of innocent people"? And how does Schultz get to be in the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive persecution, why does he persist in wearing the uniform of the Ruritanians? Chaplin still did not know the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is totally out of place with the gloomy spirit of the time. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of "silent" comedy sets, loose in the narrative line of clothes. It's about the direct scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man with the accompaniment of Brahms, and the balloon ballet (watch the segment recorded in reverse). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard is the implacably perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are incredibly nice, and the Jewish refuge in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so too Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, challenging, witty, hard-working and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of Judaism in the ghetto cage. "Wow, am I not cute?" She asks, after the barber gives her a makeover. Too cute by far, is the answer. She does not look like the truth, because Chaplin has turned her into a caricature. The 'would not it be wonderful?' The speech that Chaplin puts in his mouth is typical of the author: too verbose and emotionally cloying. <br /> <br /> Jack Oakie is as good as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. It brings a mouthful of much-needed comical verve to the proceedings, but the underlying weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is foolish and ineffective, how can we fear him? And, anyway, the start and stop stuttering of the train projected backwards is a good example of Chaplinesque of a gag that persists far beyond its comic value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel? uniform?
