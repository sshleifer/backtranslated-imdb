Although it is not a complete waste of time, 'Eighteen' really was not as sweet as it pretended to be. Nor are they the ages of the actors they portray? 18, my ass. McKellen could have appeared in the film telling us that he was 30 years old and asking us to create it. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible in adolescence in Parts II and III of 'Back to the Future' (well, maybe not, probably credible.) If he can overcome the obvious age defect, he will have either the emptiness full of acting or overexploitation (the so-called anguish of Paul Anthony, the lifelong moments of Clarence Sponagle, and although I am in favor of Brendan Fletcher, it is better to see him, and more, in 'Freddy Vs. Jason') incomprehensible scenes (a marriage faster than Britney Spears, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help urinating, but still has a free hand, I guess this was the writer's fantasy), a complete movie of despicable characters ( Anthony may be playing someone who is 18 years old, but acts as if he were 12 years old and some strange "John" was released so that Anthony's character, Pip, can save the day? Was there really a sex scene in front of a baby? ?) and pr√° all the characters question theirs. Sexuality by strange actions / scenes. On the positive side, I enjoyed Ian McKellen's voice-over, seeing a heterosexual / homosexual friendship (rarely well represented), love of puppies (of someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is,) good punctuation, some decent dialogue (I love the separation) Of gays and pedophilia? I wish more people would realize that) and acting from the protagonists (as well as Cumming.) I really can not recommend it, since it really is trying to be too many things. gay tolerance, gay hustle, homeless people, epic of World War II, priesthood, first love, defective judges, etc, etc, etc? with a very small budget.
