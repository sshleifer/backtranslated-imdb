What the hell happened to RGV? There are so many wrong things about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start, first and worst, music. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that told you the mood, quite pathetically, I might add. Second, lighting: do we really need such dark scenes in which we wonder if the projector is still working? And finally, if you are going to Indianize the Godfather and the Godfather 2, keep in mind that many of us have seen. Nayakan was a GF1 scam, but better done and more entertaining. I have seen a similarity in both Company and Sarkar and, while the RGV Ab Tak 56 was brilliant, these two films leave much to be desired. People will no longer be impressed with corrupt politicians and the rest. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, who is good enough to be RGV!
