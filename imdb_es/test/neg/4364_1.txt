I'm sorry, but this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. I can not believe that after doing the first of the series they were able to obtain a budget to make another one. It's not that the budget could have been a lot; this is the least fearsome film I've seen and laughed to the end (I really can not believe we saw it until the end) but I think it's because we could not. I can not believe it.
