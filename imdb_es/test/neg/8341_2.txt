I saw the trailer of this movie before seeing Titanic, and I must admit that it whet my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a chicharr√≥n humid. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is beyond belief: she is supposed to be 13, not 4. But scientists, firemen and peripheral characters no longer offer anything. This movie is located right in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those 2 movies are completely frightening. This has some reasonable effects, but in general it is 1 out of 10. Do not waste time
