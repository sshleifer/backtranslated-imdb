The most predictable movie I've seen ... extremely boring, I feel I've seen hundreds of movies with the same story as this one. Acting is fine at best, there is really no action and there is definitely no emotion. Capable actors with a terrible script, I think it could have been written better by a tenth grader. I felt more like a task to see because I expected something in this movie to differentiate it from all the other garbage, but this fit perfectly into the pile. The whole movie was waiting for something good to happen, but it never came. I never rated the movies and never reviewed them, but this movie was so bad that I had to log in here and post a review to try to save some poor souls from wasting their time (and / or money) with this movie. I hacked it and wish I had never wasted the space of the hard drive. If I spent $ 10 to see this in theaters, I would commit suicide.
