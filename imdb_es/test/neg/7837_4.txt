The maximum risk is quite surprising for a person who has seen more of his movies. Director Ringo Lam made an average action movie, which can be compared to most other medium-quality action films, which is a special predicate for a `Muscles from Brussels` movie. It has a rather elegant style, an interesting atmosphere and, finally, the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry for his performance, he does a relatively good job. Of course, you can not compare the Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) With "Ronin", but after watching "Knock off" it's a good movie ... on special standards, of course.
