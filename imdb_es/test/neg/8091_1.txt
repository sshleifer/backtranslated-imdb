This movie is trash, it looked very funny in the previews, but I did not laugh once through the whole movie. Do yourself a big favor and do not waste your money on this, do not waste anyone's money on this. I gave it a 1/10 believe me, I would have given less if I could. I am a 15 year old boy and I thought it was crap if you want to watch a good movie go out and see Jay and Silent Bob counterattack.
