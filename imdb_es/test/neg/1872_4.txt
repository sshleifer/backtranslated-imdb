I just heard "The Rain People" at Turner Classic Movies one night. The film premiered in 1969. Shirley Knight plays Natalie, a Long Island housewife who, for reasons unknown, leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. On the way, she picks up a former football player "Jimmy" (James Caan), who has been expelled from his university and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns on the road between these two, as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize that she is mentally limited and can not take care of herself. He is going through his own struggles, it goes without saying, and he is not in a position to worry about him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown sometimes; she makes some strange calls to her husband, who begs her to go home. Natalie tries to leave Jimmy several times, only to re-enter her life through the circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and worried policeman who befriends Natalie. You have the feeling that this movie is going to end badly, and it does. This movie is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat deficient. Francis Ford Coppola directed this and, of course, would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing "The Godfather". It goes without saying that the actors are good, as they would all have futures ahead of them in the movie. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and seems to simply inhabit this character. This movie is still little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is one of the first Coppola films, and I confess that I had never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies for taking it to a new audience.
