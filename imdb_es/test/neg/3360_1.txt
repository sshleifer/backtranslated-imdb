Jack Frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be frustrated if they are fired with super-soakers loaded with margaritas. How about that for a plot? The film is based on a premise so ridiculous that it barely raises an eyebrow when the characters are killed with barbecue tongs and are impaled by carrots. You could even say that the whole movie is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). <br /> <br /> It's true that there are some fantastic phrases that include a comment about the Murderous Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> Just times are difficult, but that does not justify the willingness of the actors to participate in such an absolute gut. <br /> <br /> For those fans who expect to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept it as a simple phallic carrot that crawls on the beach with cutesy comments.
