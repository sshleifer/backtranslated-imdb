Beneath the soft spoilers. <br /> <br /> The perspective of the war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the initial scene of the European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment value here, although the images of the dust bowl are interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is quite forgettable: Herr Docktor Coburn, with a rather bad accent, and his daughter joined America with the help of Wayne. Apart from the dust bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the film is one that looks better in retrospect. Coburn's discourse comparing Naziism to a malignant disease worse than cancer and describing successes (then current) as a momentary burst of energy from a patient just before death was disturbingly accurate and Dr. Scherer of Varno played with precision to publish images of unrepentant Nazi war news that justify their actions. <br /> <br /> When viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it to entertain you outside the perspective of World War II, you should say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
