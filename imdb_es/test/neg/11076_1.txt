Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they find a formula that works very well, sometimes they try bravely to tell a worthy story despite the problems of time and budget, sometimes they are so bad that they are really funny ... and, sometimes, they are "La Caverna". <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain whims that make you guess, should allow you to get interested in the characters and their motivations so that you really have some kind of reaction when they die. However, The Cavern chooses, instead, to introduce elements that work at the beginning, only to be denied by their own lackluster narration. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgettable and any real story that can make any of them even. Remotely interesting is revealed in a monologue of 30 seconds, which makes it impossible to do more than laugh, since the characters are chosen almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least frightening way possible. <br /> <br /> (To spoil the scene a bit, a victim is taken during a complete blackout that could have been a little scary if the sound effect used to indicate that he killed does not remind you of removing a pot of macaroni and cheese too thick Add to this formula The camera that works makes me think that the director saw too many videos of Nine Inch Nails and an ending that, in an attempt to be shocking, is not good for anything but annoying and confusing the viewer, and it has an almost imperceptible horror, a film that fails on all levels. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest with you, if you want a horror film and claustrophobic caving go and see "The Descent", and I feel weird saying that because I did not do it particularly, enjoy that movie either.
