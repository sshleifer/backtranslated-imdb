With Al Jolson at the height of his popularity and Jazz Singer by Warner Brothers being the highest-grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would produce some vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer had the sensation of being the first speaker, the Matinée Idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker), and has to settle for just its visual antics. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol was one of the first directing works for the renowned Frank Capra. The first pair of complete functions of Capra for Harry Langdon reveal a very colorful and excessive style, which made Langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unmatched. A couple of photos later and Capra has learned to calm down a bit, with some pretty regular and decent camera work. However, he still does not show aptitude for shooting physical comedy. The longest comic routine, performance on stage, seems to have some good gags, but everything is divided into many different camera angles, and there is no possibility that the comedy flows naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a good part of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are too many of them and none of them is especially fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, Capra would eventually mature into a good dramatic and romantic one. Director, and you can see it starting to develop in this regard. He cuts the line and approaches the love of Walker and Bessie in the scene in which she looks at him for the first time when Don Wilson gets up, carefully establishing the wordless connection between them. Then there is a beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together in the masquerade, which is very reminiscent of the love scenes at the Capra exit in the early thirties. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic time is good, but there is nothing that makes him stand out. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is also a pretty good actress, with a very expressive face. Congratulations to her for getting involved with physical comedy and losing her dignity with children. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, that actor of resounding and cheerful character that seems to appear absolutely in the late 20s and early 30s. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol is one of those images that has won more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director who later made a handful of masterpieces. In itself, it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of Capra's work before meeting Robert Riskin, it was a disappointment.
