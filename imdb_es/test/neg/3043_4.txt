This movie had the potential to be a good high school thriller. Instead, we got a boring festival about a spoiled and pampered babysitter. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming to be killed. It was obvious that they were just killing time. The main character was insipid and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotion during this movie. She was there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The children survive, so it's obvious that they're going to let Jill survive. The only reason he got a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer comes FINALLY) are really exciting.
