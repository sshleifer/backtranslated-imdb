My tolerance for an unsafe address was overwhelmed by some of the options of this good and time-consuming one. <br /> <br /> When the "romantic" intervals were of a nature to get me out of the story. and in "How and why-did-the-filmmaker-do- / that /?" In mode, you have to imagine that something is missing there; I think moderation and good taste. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a capable and empathetic actor, usually. I think he did not like the project or the people, and it shows. I do not remember anything the other boy did. I can not even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it does not have to be good to entertain; Some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even witty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie ($ 2.00 purchase at the video rental site) against the writer's advice; I understand that you were tempted to remove your name from the credits. A matter of pride, I bet.
