For people who have no idea what a comedy is. That not only includes the people who liked this movie, but the people who made it. What could they have been thinking? Madonna playing judy holliday? Please, she can not even play MADONNA (if there really is a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne has been well paid. He deserved every penny he received, because if this did not kill his career, nothing would. I am sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left the feeling that they had chosen their pockets. Apparently, Madonna has overcome the point of feeling embarrassed by her almost total lack of talent as an actress, but you can not help feeling ashamed for her anyway. She has no connection with the rest of the cast; It seems that she appeared on the set and said: "Well, I'm here, I'm going to embarrass myself by making the worst impression of Judy Holliday that anyone has seen, now stay out of my way" and then proceeded to do exactly that. I know that the phrase "Madonna rotten movie" is redundant, but it certainly fits this. It is painful to see an "actress" totally inept and without talent to make a fool of himself, but apparently it does not bother him, since he does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only remotely funny thing about this "comedy" is that he actually managed to find people who gave him the money to do it. Now that's funny.
