This person is a so-called actor who has to resort to blasphemy, vulgarity and slander to try to make others believe that he has talent. I have often seen that comics use a little of each one with effect, but when all that can be said is related to them, it is a sign of a deformed mind affected by drugs. It makes me wonder where his brain will be twisted and fried in a few more years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit that I could not see everything, too stupid for words. The amazing thing about this is that someone really believes he is a philosopher! It is not surprising that self-esteem and decency are diminishing and perversity is increasing. Could it be that the UFC could have been a factor in your dead brain?
