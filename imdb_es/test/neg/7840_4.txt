"Maximum risk" is a step aside for Van Damme and just one more part of the insipid B action movies that we have come to expect from the films with the Belgian male martial artist. The movie has holes in open pitches, nonsense in abundance, a disorderly conglomerate plot, and a beautiful Henstridge that spends most of its time looking like it's waiting for a signal. The "maximum risk" is not distinguished in any way and probably will not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences. (DO-)
