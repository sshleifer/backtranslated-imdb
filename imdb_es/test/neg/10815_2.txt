I can not help but forget that incredible scene in Alien, when the alien came out of one of the men's chests. Or even in Predator when the invisible monster sneaked over the bewildered soldiers and tore them to pieces. Both films expressed fascinating ideas about the characteristic of the common and ordinary creature. Return to the era of the cheesy B movies and see big men in fake costumes parading killing people in small towns. Now recognize that the two previous films revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve it. Do not try anything new, and worst of all, The Cave does not even have good blood. Shame on them, shame on everyone. <br /> <br /> The Cave's one-dimensional characters go for sexy spandex. It seems to everyone that they do not care when they witness the death of their colleagues. They simply walk along, without the knowledge of the evil creature lurking in the dark. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have the two brothers, the black man and the sexy scientist. The rest (for the rest I mean all those who find themselves with grisly deaths) are even more uninteresting than the others. We have the Korean assistant, the risky outdoor girl, a Russian scientist and two divers, both without sense of emotion and stupid enough to roam alone. This film surpasses being extremely clich√©, since all but the black, one of the brothers and the scientist, come to an end. It also seems that only Americans can survive terror, since Russian and Korean die. Do not be offended if I leave you details. Anyway, there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> To be direct, find this cave. They enter the cave. They get stuck in the cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them is spread in the cave. More die in the cave. They leave the cave; only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a frightening monster, which really does not seem to bother them. That is the simplicity of the mediocre plot. It does not even try to be original. He even has the part where they decide that their leader is not capable and they separate. We have seen it many times before. <br /> <br /> In a movie like this, people do not care about the performances, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is so sad. Cole Hauser was especially unsophisticated and I do not mean Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is unquestionably the best of the film. His acting is actually decent. He portrays the guy who calms everyone. All other actors are average at best. In a show like this, that's not really bad. <br /> <br /> Now to the reason we're going to this movie genre; The action, of course. Well, to my regret, the action was boring. The scenes of death are boring, hell was the whole movie. There is hardly any blood at all. Either they disappear and find themselves later or they are attacked and die without bruises. Seeing the death of the Korean man was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's pretty amazing. Bad things about the shadow of most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were well made, and they were. The only thing wrong is that, as everything happens in a cave, it will be dark. I found it extremely difficult to distinguish between the walls of the cave and the monsters. So it was quite difficult to even see the creatures. Although I liked the special effects, the monsters were nothing original. They all looked alike and were not scared at all. <br /> <br /> The Cave marks the directorial debut of Bruce Hunt. I do not see what I was trying to achieve when making this movie. Obviously he made a big mistake. Almost everything about this movie reeked like a scent bomb. A smell bomb is probably even more pleasurable than seeing this disaster again. Only the most forgiving viewer will find this as forgivable. I gave up all hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "what the hell was that" for the third time.
