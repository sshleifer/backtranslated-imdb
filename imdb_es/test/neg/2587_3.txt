The "Black Widow" by Debra Winger in 1987 is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> This is like a boring version, and Jane Seymour usually does it better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is pretty poor at this too. Simply playing his usual role as a rebellious and bored child. <br /> <br /> Maybe the two were Dr. Quinn's to get excited. <br /> <br /> If so, go grab a copy of "Black Widow".
