This is due in large part to the plot of the captains. Although it has grown quite a lot, it is partly the story of a wealthy boy who is shanghaied as a member of the crew aboard a cargo ship and becomes a man in the process. Moran's title is a young woman who also grew up on a boat that is owned by her father. When the load burns, she and the crew members are evacuated to our boy's ship. However, the captain has contraband in his mind and his intentions are not honorable as far as Moran is concerned. The inevitable occurs: our boy falls in love with Moran and her for him. In the end, evil is subdued and lovers are united. An interesting dialogue indicates that Moran does not belong to any man, "or to any woman". (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless like Moran and neither is she too attractive. Valentino does well in a romantic, action role. His sexy construction and physique are shown in advantage and the role is quite masculine. He is very attractive. This is not a great movie but time passes. What it really shows is the beauty and sensuality of Valentino.
