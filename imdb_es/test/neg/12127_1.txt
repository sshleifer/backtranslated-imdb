This movie was terrible. The performance was scarce, but it is difficult to know if someone acted well, since the writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst movies. I discourage anyone who sees it. <br /> <br /> If you have to see Cry-Baby, I recommend you to silence it and simply comment Mr. Depp's mouth by the hour and hour. half.
