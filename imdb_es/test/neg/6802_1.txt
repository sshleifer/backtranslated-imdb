I do not know how this movie has received so many positive comments. One can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed," but those things do not make up for the empty plot that was full of sexual innuendo. I wish I had not wasted my time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, it was a bad excuse to promote strange and lascivious behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that this kind of life is normal and fine. From the beginning I asked myself what was the point of this film, and I continued to watch it, hoping it would change and I was disappointed enough to continue in the same direction. I'm so glad I did not spend the money to see this in a theater!
