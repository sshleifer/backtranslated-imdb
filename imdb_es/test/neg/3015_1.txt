1) Men over 25 who refer to themselves, without irony, as having "game", or who are a "player" or a "ball player". Gentlemen, from now on it's a quick descent to star in your own real-life version of "A Night at the Roxbury." <br /> <br /> 2) saying "The V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." in itself it is not bad, but when preceded by "The" it instantly becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. This goes double for whites. <br /> <br /> 3) People who make TV shows based on things they do not know are not good and then appear in the IMDb posing as "fanatics", (... right ...) in addition, one of which is "United States" (hey, me too!) to bitterly insult the members of his potential audience for inevitably thinking that his program sucks. Less 1 point of additional demerit if you use some variation in the justification of oh-snap-nice-one-bro that "if you do not like the program, obviously you can not have sex". <br /> <br /> 4) Canadian Hip-Hop / R & B Feel in Massari ... a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day, Massari gets the gas face by the simple reason that its low-cost brand American Aping Uncool and General Aqua Velva Douchebagery are complemented by the general sensitivity of "Keys to the VIP". <br /> <br /> 5) Last, but not least, "Keys to the V.I.P." ... for all the above reasons and more.
