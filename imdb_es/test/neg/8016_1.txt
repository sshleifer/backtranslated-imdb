This movie is an almost complete waste of time. I am studying the book for my level of English A, and the film only contributes in one way, and that shows that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The performance is made of wood, the filmography is laughable, and the so-called dramatic scenes of the film made the majority of my class (including myself) make fun of their texts. The book, although not my favorite literary option, is much better than the movie, and the sound track is simply irritating. Do not look at this movie unless you are looking for a timeless and quality plot transformed into a waste of meaningless media.
