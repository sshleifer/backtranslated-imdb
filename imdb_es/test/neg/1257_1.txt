An insult to both poker and the cinema, this film manages to turn the most dynamic, brilliant and fascinating figure in the history of poker into complete boredom. It's still a fun movie to make jokes, from the clich√©s of gangster films of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. Hilariously, Stu Ungar wins his three World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. His infamous merchant abuse? 1 scene Your coca habit? 1 scene His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They could not even get real poker players. What did they cover? Lots of high angle shots from the inside of a house in the suburbs. Oh, and a montage of Stu waking up every day and buying meat that does not make any sense. Why do I care so much about this little summer camp of the Sopranos that tries to take advantage of the madness of poker? Because I think there's still a great movie to do about Stu Ungar that waits for someone willing to do it right.
