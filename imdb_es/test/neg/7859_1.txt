"Heaven Can Wait" is a crushing bore and a misogynist lie covered in candy. I can not imagine anyone else than film students sitting today. Don Ameche is in almost every scene, and although he has a mellifluous voice that undoubtedly contributed to his successful career in radio, he does not have the charisma to carry this film. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence loveable and fun, so he orders Ameche to play the role as smoothly as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on softness translates into a main character that is both boring and completely unpleasant. You do not want to spend any time with this man; I would put you to sleep. You would not leave him alone with your daughter, no matter what his age. Something spooky would happen. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie is pretty boring. Scene after scene consists of static photos, excessively illuminated, diorama-like, shirts and busts filled with Gilded Age carefully dressed resting in overcrowded Victorian salons. There are so many ruffles, ornaments and curves, both lilac and sky blue and pink that you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore pornography, but it presents that hatred with a candy cape and a small sweet bow on top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is disgusting. In one of the most odious scenes in the film, an old woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
