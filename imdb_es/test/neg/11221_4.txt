I share the same opinion with respect to Underworld than the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I sat for 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was about and, more importantly, why the author and / or the director had made certain decisions for the plot . In general, I found that the movie was unbalanced, which consisted of strange plots that (IMHO) really had nothing to do with the movie. Also, when writing a thriller, I would say that you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story was filmed ...
