I think the problem with some reactions to this movie is that, with few exceptions, they do not focus on the main disconnect, hence the main division in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those that are taken by the visual design, beautiful costumes and variety of elements that go into the film. Some fans of children's films love color and animation, and all the "magical" effects that do not scare, animals that change shape, etc. Some culture vultures like the complicated references, the layers of different elements of folklore and the fact that they can see Zhang Ziyi singing and almost imitating, in two different languages, what was really meant to be a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other side, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a mix of folk tales is not a story at all, and that it is easier to believe in magic when There is enough thought and care. I went into the technical aspects to make it look real. <br /> <br /> In other words, ideas can be beautiful; But when you put them on stage they have to deliver. Here, they do not. <br /> <br /> A good folk tale, from any country, has a clear story, a point and characters that interact strongly with each other. This is missing for everyone. A few gestures too sophisticated for opera, Western and Japanese, do not replace a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fan of fantasy, I must say that I have sat through some turkeys and that I have loved some, but this one really tries to do too many things, at a low price. Put in Zhang Ziyi to try to add some glitter smells to exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no plot; There's half a plot, which means you're still being dragged, and then you fall back when another dance number starts that is not very well executed. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to know that they are starring in a movie. Unless you really like watching the amateur video of other people, this is not good. I would like to try this on real children; I think they would leave it for Uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes.
