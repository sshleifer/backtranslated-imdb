This is the result of the city of Milpitas California that makes a home movie and submits it to the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey, this movie is rightly considered a bad movie. Part comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of actors who do not act. The plot has something to do with a giant monster that is created from garbage and pollution in the area and goes on a rampage. The monster, which we do not see until the last 20 minutes, looks pretty attractive, but it is not good enough to justify seeing the previous hour of boredom. Frankly, even lovers of bad movies are going to have a hard time getting to the end. This is a stinker.
