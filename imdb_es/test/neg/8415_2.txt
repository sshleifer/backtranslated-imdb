I was hoping that Pulp was an interesting movie, but I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pulp has a very small history, and what you never have is what interests you. It was a real struggle to keep seeing him. When it's over, you tell yourself "eh? That's it?" This is one that you think about after seeing it: why did you get upset? <br /> <br /> It's very bad because Michael Caine is a good actor. I also expected to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on the screen for a total of maybe a minute. Scott is one of the best girls of all time of noir femme fatale and this was her last film. <br /> <br /> Oh, well ...
