I do not pretend to sound pretentious here, but calling this the next cult classic is another example of the lower standards that filmmakers have for themselves. This film is an offense to everything we consider sacred, and not in the "artistic" way of offending. This film becomes the archetype of the DANGER dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.
