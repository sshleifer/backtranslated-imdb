I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper movie and I was surprised to discover a poor quality direction, an uncomfortable dialogue, a mediocre rhythm, slapstick non-motivated gags and a general roughness that permeated the film . It's just not funny! The sets seemed cheap, Donfeld's costumes, usually excellent, are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. All the characters in children's books do not come close to representing the married couple whose life is upset when they lose their job. For a film that seems to point to the injustice of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers have no problem being unfair, allowing stereotypes of Hispanics, blacks and gays to play at such a cruel level. The look of the film resembles any episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. In this world of white-collar robberies abound the fashions of the seventies that only give an air of implausibility to each situation. Out of a clever initial idea, and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this exercise dated social commentary becomes forced and petty for minorities, especially for homosexual people. If you want a better Caper movie, you'll be better off with The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. That's funny!
