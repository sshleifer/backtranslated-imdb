Supreme Sanction is a film about an assassin who works for the government of the United States. She has to kill a well-known television reporter, but she forgives her life when she sees that he has a small daughter. Because he has not killed him, he becomes the next target of his employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not good, although I've seen worse series movies. A hitman with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of the fight against terror ... What's next? Aliens rescuing the victim ??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win any prize for the script. And the performance is not better, I'm afraid. Some well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had many accounts to pay and therefore accepted to play in this movie, along with some other actors who probably do not even know what a camera really looks like. Neither does the movie do any good. <br /> <br /> So, why should I watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do than watch an action movie and you're tired of the 10,531 repetition of Mc Gyver or the A team, this could be the movie you want to see. Otherwise it will be better that you leave it alone. I give it a 3/10.
