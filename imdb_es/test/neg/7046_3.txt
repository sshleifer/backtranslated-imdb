It really is a pity that there is so much controversy surrounding this image (in other words, the infamous affair between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), since this attracted a lot of attention to a very forgettable film. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And, to make matters worse, the film is full of amateur actors who can barely speak English. I would have really preferred the subtitles, it would have made the experience less exhausting. Back to the rotten performance. The neo-realist movement was big in Italy when this movie was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (like Umberto D from De Sica, Children are watching us and Miracle in Milan) because they got a lot out of non-professional actors. They behaved like normal people, but in Stromboli they act like normal people who TRY to be actors and behave very badly, like children in a school play. <br /> <br /> By the way, ... if you're waiting for the movie to have a good ending (so do not worry about your time commitment to the movie). The plot was totally unwrapped and silly, so much, that I really realized that I could not care about the characters. Like the island they inhabit, the film is desolate and without color or life.
