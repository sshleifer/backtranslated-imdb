Three words: What a pile ... Two words: Do not bother! One word: Sucked! There are zero reasons to see this movie. Even those Seagal groupies should stay away from this movie. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. Martial arts move well, but cinematography is pathetic. The film actually goes in slow motion every time Seagal gives his "death movement" to his victims. Worse, it shows the same movement three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid Seagal's performance was stupid, but I still give this movie a "6" for acting due to the cast cast whose "villain" roles were quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The argument is simply silly. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. Your character also has that dedicated work ethic, which means that all of your packages are delivered to the right people on time, at no extra charge, and nothing gets in your way. Not assassins, political leaders, explosions or even death. <br /> <br /> I expect some level of violence in a martial arts movie, but there are several scenes in this film of random and horrific acts of violence that lend themselves in no way to the advancement of the film or its history . There is a reason why this movie went directly to the video and there are many reasons to avoid it. Nobody should bother with this gut. <br /> <br />
