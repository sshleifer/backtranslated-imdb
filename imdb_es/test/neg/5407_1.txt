This is classified as the worst movies of all time. No investigation or thought at all came into this movie. Action scenes were released at random intervals that made no sense in the context of the movie. Items appeared and disappeared randomly, etc. It is obvious that this was led by a "specialist coordinator", who should go back to his old job. The skeleton man mounted a horse throughout the film, which, surprisingly, could change color at will. Either that, or someone thought the audience would be color blind and would not notice. The blood would be on the actors in one scene and the next would miraculously disappear and then reappear. It seems that everyone who connected with this movie forgot to look for inconsistencies.
