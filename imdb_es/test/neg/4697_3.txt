I just came back to see, "comedian." It was good. He kept watching the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I like to pay $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, it would be an excellent feature of HBO. If this was something I was watching on television, I would be hooked. It gives a surprising insight into what comics go through before and after they take the stage. It will interest anyone who likes to watch comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the cinema, I like to entertain myself. I'm not there to be educated. Now I know what it is for Jerry Seinfeld before he goes on stage ... great. But honestly, I'd rather just laugh at their jokes than worry about some of that. <br /> <br /> One more thing: with the bad attitude that Onry Adams has; I hope to see you taking my order from Burger King before seeing your HBO special. He was not funny. He's the kind of person you love to hate.
