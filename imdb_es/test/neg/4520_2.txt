Wow, even American Idol and So you think you can dance you have more things for adults now than WWE (at least the auditions have several people who abuse the judges) and here is WWE, which shows one of the worst movements in the history of television, by becoming PG. Now, when I change sometimes to see what is happening, this is what I get: <br /> <br /> 1) Hornswoggle, the ugly dwarf who shares his space with the main participants so apparently there is no reason, except to thrill the young fans and of course, defeating Chavo Guerrero, a capable fighter, in each fight <br /> <br /> 2) A guest host (arghh ...!) every week to ruin the teaspoon of Fun that was otherwise present. All these hosts are cheap B-category celebrities who try to catapult themselves back into fame, making horrendous 5 year old jokes and making silly references. <br /> <br /> 3) Cryme Time and a fighter (forgot her name, most likely Eva) giving lessons about several words of "calle" (sob) that are neither street nor fresh. Before they were funny, they stole things and they were loud mouths. <br /> <br /> 4) The divas are dressed in outfits that can not be seen, and they put on their best to look "sexy, intelligent and powerful (by the way, I hate this slogan) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? Those were the times.Also, these divas are bad fighters, which adds to the misery.I've seen some old WWE matches in the Vintage collection and the divas there were "amateur" non-amateur. /> <br /> 5) The movement of PG restricts many things: there is almost no blood during games, DX is terribly irritating, John Cena does even more of his act of patriotism, crowd with many children (who are so annoying) , almost without "heels", etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yes, why keep PPV so often? One in each month, have you lost it? No real enmity and rivalry is created and those that are made seem false and fair until the PPV takes over one. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and some of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat Ching is the longest running television show in history" (every week "<br /> <br />" The BRUTAL and VICIOUS assault of (do not use it for no one else) Randy Orton / Legacy "<br /> <br />" A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, the husband of Triple-H !!! ??? "<br /> <br /> The WWE is almost on the verge of disappearing Hope Vince gets up from her dream and does something (brings back the TV-14 or the attitude era) 2 out of 10 for the current status of WWE.
