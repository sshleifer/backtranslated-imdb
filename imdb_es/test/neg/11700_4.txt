This story had a good argument about four elderly men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to take revenge on men. This story from time to time made me fall asleep during the movie in the middle of the exhausting music of the elevator and the thunderstorms so consistent. But it is worth waiting at the end when we discover who is the mysterious woman who continues to harass the elderly in their dreams and interfering in the life of a young man. What I liked most about this movie was the suspense in which the young woman appears to men just before her death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her call them, I thought: "Not that face again." But it was a good movie, I just wish the pace was not so slow or that the performance was not so tedious. And what I also liked about the movie was the 1920s flashback, very authentic and the original costumes.
