So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to have almost no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has launched into a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the success of the films is understandable, as it has exuberant graphics, fast fight sequences and some great characters. However, if you have not played FF7, you probably do not enjoy this movie, as your story continues from the game without a previous explanation and you are likely to miss the plot even if you have played. Secondly, there is no character development, without prior knowledge of the game, your opinions about the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for fans of FF7, the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's great to see all the characters you grew up to love from the game played in an incredible computer animation. One last complaint, the movie, at least in my opinion, tried to cram too much in less than two hours and, therefore, the last half hour or so seems terribly hasty. If you played and enjoyed FF7, then it is a worthwhile watch, although it is nothing special. If you have not played FF7, it is better that you play it first before watching this movie.
