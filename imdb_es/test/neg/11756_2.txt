This is, by itself, a film above average, but why on behalf of Bog was it made? It is impossible to treat it as a thing in itself because it is a remake almost shot by shot of a 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic. You can not see it without the 1960 film stuck in your conscience. <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we give credit to Van Sandt and his associates with anything other than the decision to use different actors, slightly different sets and color? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive but lacks the firm determination of Janet Leigh to become a respectable middle class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought her unsuccessful attempt to marry and settle down, the despair of a forty-year-old woman. And Heche does not project anxiety like Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking out the window of his car illustrates the weakness in the paper. In the original, the officer asks: "Is there something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not, am I acting as if something is wrong?" The officer hesitates before answering: "Well, frankly, yes." That exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, without a doubt, is the replacement of Vince Vaughn by Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins on paper? Perkins is twisted, like a bird, with a long neck, wrapped in an exterior of external charm that masks an interior emptiness. Every movement (eat sweet corn, with the apple of Adam wagging) and each expression, the faint laugh, the dry laugh, are right. He simply can not be improved. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a corpulent man with short hair who has just been released as Lance Corporal of the US Army. UU To suggest his psychosis, all he can do is superimpose a maniacal laughter on what appears to be a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn does not even stumble upon the word "fallacy" because it resembles "phallus.") He might be hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a UCLA soccer scholarship. <Br /> <br /> The address deserves some comments. I do not see what he adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while furtively looking at Anne Heche. I am not opposed to it. I wonder why it's there, just like I wonder why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And, I suppose to impress us with the amount of color that is added to the visual experience, it seems that Van Sant have lost a bit of the more subtle things of Hitchcock. Heche is given underwear of all colors: green, pink, orange and mango. Is that a color? If so, what the hell is the color? No matter. The point is that in the original, when the camera travels for the first time through the window of the Phoenix hotel, capture Janet Leigh in bed with a half pure white slip and a white bra. Later, after she has stolen the money, we see her again in her underwear, this time both the slip and the bra are black. It's a small thing, but Hitch's. <br /> <br /> In that sense, the idea of ​​shooting in color might not have been bad, except that the black and white filming of the original was excellent. The color and the strange effects of lighting in this version make the ordinary motel, boring and subliminally ominous in something that seems to belong to the most sumptuous part of Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the 1960 film was Shocking in more ways than one. I remember seeing him in a movie theater in San Diego and being stunned by watching the screen when it became clear that the central character was DEAD: in the middle of the movie! Nothing like this had been done before. <br /> <br /> That murder in the shower, in both movies, was a big improvement over the original Robert Bloch novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like "The murderer went into the bathroom and he cut his head with a knife. " I'm not inventing that. Well, not at all. Even here, van Sant's movie gives us excess. There is more blood and more naked flesh. And where Hitchcock first approached the blood surrounding the bathtub drain and dissolved into Marian's vacant eye, then slowly withdrew the camera to reveal his face, turned his camera from a slight incline to the correct vertical, giving the a spectator not only of disbelief in the face of murder, but of a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant does not tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as did Hitchcock. It practically turns it on its axis. <br /> <br /> It will not do any good to call Hitchcock a bow because he is not. It's a pecuniary plunder of Hitchcock's material (already ripped off in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: The Beginning Years", and "Come Into My Parlor: Mrs. Bates' Revenge" and "Hand Me That Knife Would you do it ?: The TRUE story of Norman Bates. "A review and rejection of truly original things, a criminal act, if not a criminal one, not to mention the many tributes in other films, especially French ones, such as the notorious ones. scenes "Ocean of boredom" between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much admired "La Mere de la Nuit" (Perhaps it is better to add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt to parody the academic critics. a chicken grinds corn, it is a "crumenal" act, I will not continue except to say these jokes, miserable, as they are, they are more fun than the movie.) <br /> <br /> So, who was it made for? I'd have to guess ... Children who are too young to know about the origi nal and who do not like black and white movies? Children who expect to see another slasher movie? Chimpanzees?
