A Lassie movie that should have been "put to sleep" ... FOREVER. This is how I would describe this painful and sad waste of time in a movie. So mediocre in all aspects that it becomes a boring and uninteresting disaster, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen. It is not even an achievement like a movie "so bad is good" or "so bad is memorable". The idea that Lassie becomes bad is intriguing, but in reality it happens very little, and so slowly, that you feel your life is going there while you watch the non-actors read their lines on the waiting cards waiting for their miserable checks. <br /> It's an empty hollow shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your time or your children's time. Unless both are very medicated. That is all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will make you crazy to bark! Hahahah, do you understand? BARK! Hahahahahaha <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a difficult week.
