Without redeeming features, this movie is garbage. Your jokes do not start to be funny. Humor for children is pathetic, and attempts to attract adults only add a sticky grumpiness to the whole miserable package. Sitting with my children just made me feel uncomfortable about what might come next. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my son for whom he bought the DVD enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. Receive frequent requests for repetitions.
