I remember when you did a great thing about this when I was dating. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. He debuted the opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Then it went into a tailspin. Critics hated this movie. I do not remember seeing a good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I did not know what they meant at the time, but now, since the movie makes references to gay bars, women are slapped and almost raped and a nasty-looking bar bathroom with overflowing potties hahaha. When I was younger, I did not care about that. It was Hulkamania, brother! <br /> <br /> Now I find it pretty bad, but it's still fun to watch it from time to time when it's combined with Bodyslam (which has a better story). First of all, Hulk Hogan's acting skills are not excellent. He is one-dimensional like the character that plays in the wrestling ring. And in reality, Rip and Hulk are not far from each other. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he's not good at playing the bad guy. He is better at comedy and nervous drama characters. He simply is not believable like Brell. There is not much character development in this film and those who suffer are the characters of Randy, Rip's brother and Charlie the trainer (in the fight he is a coach who hides a fighter until the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way he's supposed to play, so there's no problem there. Joan Severence is passable and, for all the hounds, she has a lingerie scene hahaha. In the end, you realize, what's the point? <br /> <br /> For this (as with other fighting movies or movies that feature wrestlers as the main star), turn your brain off. You will enjoy it more if you do it.
