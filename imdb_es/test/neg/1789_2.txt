A handful of young brotherhoods of the university fraternity decide to go camping with a teacher. A giant druid wants to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse in the year 2000, they also have to deal with cyclists, an Indian and a monster of the Loch Ness type. It's worth seeing for just 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (a sadly anonymous film B) is on hand as a vagabond and the other 2 belong to the stunning Savannah (in one of the 3 non-pornographic roles he had ). Both have very small roles. Pity that everything else in the movie is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD extras: Original trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 asses
