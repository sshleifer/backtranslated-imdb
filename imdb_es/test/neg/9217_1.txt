I entered this film with the hope of giving an imaginative turn to the Second Coming. Boy, have I ever been wrong? The BBC is due to the time of watching a movie, the idiots to create suspense, the fools to build intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much the BBC stinks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the passage and the laborious dialogue of the loss of time was painful. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking at the clock and wondered when that stupid and monotonous nonsense would end. They spent a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is very vague and sloppy, written. Everything that happens is just to kill time. <br /> <br /> Of the 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). What a pity. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "I am God", endless, blah, blah, blah-ing, the dumb, like nails, boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SHIT.
