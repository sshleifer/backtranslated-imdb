I thought that this movie had an interesting name and that it could have turned out to be a stimulating thought, but I was wrong. This movie was boring, especially in the beginning and in the middle parts. I can not comment on the ending because I could not stand watching the whole movie. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he enters his laboratory does not make sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and, unfortunately, this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you have trouble sleeping, I recommend you rent this movie.
