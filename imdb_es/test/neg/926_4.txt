Ignore the extreme votes on "House of Wax", in no way is a "1" or a "10". I will try to be of help to anyone who thinks about seeing "House of Wax" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what the trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing safe with trailers, if the producers can not improvise a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is almost certain that the movie is a big sucking party. But a good trailer just tells you that some things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a small investigation can be valuable. <br /> <br /> "House of Wax", starring Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her Canadian compatriot Sarah Polley or her similar Rose McGowen), and was directed by an artist from previously known music video Como Jaume, in his first feature film. These are not good signs, but if you're like me, ignore them and go see the work of the production designer Grace Walken, responsible for the appearance of "Ghost Ship". Once again, Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it seems that 90% of the $ 30 million budget of the film went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate for the abuse he had to take throughout the film (with his fingers cut off, his lips glued, tied, and a lot of things in a variety of sticky things). Goodbye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than her in "The Girl Next Door", almost a big pig away from having a big weight problem. <br /> <br /> Which means they had very little left. To pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging by what was on the screen, this could be true. It seems that everyone else donated their time to get their first performance or credit from the crew. Unfortunately, either due to lack of experience or jealousy over the pay gap, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> Steven Window's DP work without experience was as horrible as probably seeing and working in a team with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here) who manage to eliminate most of the value aggregate of the production design group. Instead of delaying and showing the sets, Window filmed these things with bad lighting and camera work with sudden movements. Negran aggravated the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD type camera and fast cutting are what is used to hide a cheap and horrible production design; not what is needed when the only strength of the film is its expensive and detailed sets. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes did the script and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is recognized as the writer, though with the exception of the title and The use of wax figures has absolutely no similarity. One salvation is that the film is not taken seriously as a horror movie and is mostly parody (insert "Van Helsing" here). The murders are played for laughter, too extreme to be scary or even spooky for anyone over six years. The audience especially resented when a certain high-profile heiress of the hotel made her home-like face go through a steel bar, although her previous half-striptease was the only really creepy thing in the movie. Another highlight of the comedy was when Cuthbert put his finger through a grid and the bad boy cut it off. <br /> <br /> The good scenes take place in the Wax House of Trudy, a work of wax that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, joined twins and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe ). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida, although from the many hills it resembles the country of Paul Hogan (the explorers of the care location, the gulf coast is not characterized by its undulating terrain). The script apparently had the intention of reproducing the connection (bad wordplay) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or postproduction, most of the dialogue related to this was cut. Since what remains of the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, he wonders why it was not cut to reduce the boredom factor as well. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the opportunity. the brains recognized half of the production that had the ingredients for a first-class horror classic, even with the existing cast. What was looking at their faces was the opportunity to go somewhere with the illusion of a wax town. Because it is a photographic medium, the modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception, prone to create an illusion of reality. Here they had an opportunity prepared to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the city creates the illusion of reality from a distance, but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax manufacture up close. Of course, they would have had to find a visionary Director and an Executive Director to carry it out successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.
