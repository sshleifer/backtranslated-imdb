I must say that I was very excited about this movie before renting it, since it was a production by Adam Sandler "Happy Madison" and I am generally attracted to that kind of silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were some fun moments at the beginning of the movie, but this movie lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many movies that are not realistic can be quite funny, but this movie was not realistic or fun at all. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot did not make any sense. I can not forget the fact that 3 older ladies with class would even work to write so badly. In general, I was not very impressed with this movie and I do not recommend spending $ 5 to rent it.
