For the connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a real gem. With a truly horrible dialogue, action and direction, it is not an option for people looking for a suitable film. But as one of the funniest movies without intention of its kind, it is priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving Harley Davidson's motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes offer an opportunity to laugh. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really do not show up, but since she's playing an android, I guess you can excuse her for acting in wood. <br /> <br /> Bad lovers of the movie, do not let this happen!
