This movie was corny and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him and becomes a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was for the title. Before this guy becomes a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little annoyed because I was not the girlfriend of a gorilla: now she is the wife of the gorilla. He should have married him when he was a gorilla, so the title would make more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and everyone wants to leave. This is not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I did not even see bananas for a wedding present. Oh, of course I was not cursed yet.
