In this film, we are invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone with whom it is not pleasant to begin. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have BLOODY ENTRY, a book that I admire, by the way, to keep intact the integrity of our hero? Barely. He behaves at the party at the beginning of the film in exactly the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading of the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and the murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, and that the first had all the breaks while the second did not have any? I am afraid that Mr. Capote's difficult situation did not affect me at all, so if that was the central idea, he wasted it on me. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited us this meaningless project about us, the clumsy narrative would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a brave performance without any emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that he craved more. Beyond the credible.
