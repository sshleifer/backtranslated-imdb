This movie has a premise that is good enough for everyone to talk to, and a safe conversation initiator. 'Would you sleep with someone you do not like or do not know for a million dollars?' While the film had a lot of potential, a bad performance makes it a b-grade soap opera. The film has a great advantage, and after the proposal is made, we are really interested in the film, but then it falls dramatically. The last 3 quarters of the movie are spent by characters complaining, complaining and regretting what they have done! The ending was so clich√© that it made me cry! This has a premise very similar to that of "honeymoon in vegas", which is much better. See that in its place.
