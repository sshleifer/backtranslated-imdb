The movie is a complete disaster. I do not know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little. Maybe the writers do not really know what the situation is in foreign countries in the present or in the recent past? or they just do not care about anything and write everything they think is interesting. <br /> <br /> An excellent and eternal formula with a crazy dictator + 1 lone hero (an American, of course) may seem like a good idea, but shall we? we had a certain tyrant in Serbia (milosevic) who did many bad things to his people, but I just can not imagine him screaming "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion, as in medieval times. maybe they wanted to show how evil it was, but it was a stupid idea. the best impression would be if I did it in cold blood, as real monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: it does not matter how many national television stations there are. are in Russia, the Russian president watches the news of American SNN (CNN)? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Give me a break! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of rubish please! <br /> <br /> AWESOME!
