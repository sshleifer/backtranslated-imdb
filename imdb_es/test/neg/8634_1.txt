I know it's hard for Americans to find European films on video / DVDs, especially from the 80s, but look for the original version of The Vanishing (title Spoorloos (1988)) and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screw A lo great, especially in the final. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is so unconvincing compared to the original. Where are you thinking? Can you imagine Siete having a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily in the arms of Brad Pitt in the final? The whole point at which the original was a great international success was the shocking end. So, why do you accept this kind of remake shyte? Actually, avoid this and GET THE ORIGINAL.
