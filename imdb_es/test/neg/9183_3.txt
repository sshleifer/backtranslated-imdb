This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. The unhappy "orientals" are not happy with being in the west; so they hire a drunken wagon master (John Candy) to guide them back east. The visual gags were not fun enough to wear this. And Richard Lewis puts you on nerves very fast; but honestly, I do not like anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the clumsy villain. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died of a massive heart attack ten days before the film was completed. A support and a digital improvement allowed the character of Candy to be seen in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us a good slap on the knee, belly laughs in his career. This movie was not of the caliber of its best level. <br /> <br /> Also in the film will recognize: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
