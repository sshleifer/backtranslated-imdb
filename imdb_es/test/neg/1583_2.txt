OK, what's this story about again? I'm afraid I've never read the book and, frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies I've tried to see in a long time. I confused a bit the amount of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man without thumbs. The movie did not even explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world everyone met to join. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the film "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth, I've been trying to make a study about his film career in watching other films of his, and bluntly, apart from "What a Girl Wants ", I do not find much in what he played, that was good. I'm definitely not saying that HE was not good. He is really one of the best actors I've seen in the modern movie, but the content and quality of the films he plays have a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is another perfect example of where the director, the writer and the team are too close to their subject to see that the viewer is not capturing the image? literally. The whole movie seemed to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emotionalism that was a bore. Nothing is really explained and each one of the topics from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalytic evaluation! <br /> <br /> The character of Kristin Scott Thomas seems to enjoy describing erotic stories in front of an all-male audience and touching other men besides her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all her marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent. I suppose; and Ralph Fiennes walks like a Roman lord Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows everything. The rest of the cast is fused to the four winds as the plot progresses. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and participation with Naveen Andrews. It is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unpleasant taste. But, of course, the viewer is still baffled by how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry or accumulation. Just a slap, bam, thanks! <br /> <br /> And is not it romantic that Fiennes ended up as a traitor helping the Germans by handing them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I would simply have to say: "How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet and adorable husband who loves you". <br /> <br /> The last incredible section of this plot is to understand how someone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to show any of his acting talents? In fact, when I saw the movie, I thought it must be one of the first. The scene in which he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two-second clip worth seeing in the movie. At that time, I have no interest in seeing him again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth is trying to eliminate them all. Too bad he got lost! I would have saved an additional twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. However, the aerial scenes of the desert were quite clean.
