Uma and Travolta were very good together, but unfortunately, when they left the screen, the film was nothing more than a bunch of very boring and neat secondary characters wrapped in extremely bad writing. Occasional glimpses of grandeur, like the dance scene between Uma and Travolta, quickly eroded when people like Harvey Keitel and other similarly uninterested thugs appeared. And the white guy who tried to act black became VERY, VERY tired after too much exposure in the image. He weighed a good Rock performance, the only secondary character you could not wait to see leave the screen. Bad plot, silly. The writers clearly could not decipher if they wrote to Generation X or the rap crowd of 12 to 15 years, and the combination turned into a movie that kept me looking at my watch!
