I rented this movie at my local library and I thought it might be good considering that I like this kind of movie and considering who was in it but I was wrong. The stinking actor, the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of people known to be there, but did not they have anybody with the ability to act to be the protagonist? I noticed that some people gave him a 10. Why did you ever consider giving this pile of horses a 10. You can say it's worth a 10 for his comedy but when you vote in a movie that is not supposed to be? Be a comedy that you can not give a 10 for comedy. You have to qualify it as it was supposed to be and not because of something the director did not intend. Maybe some of you voted 10 because they thought it would be funny that this shitty movie had a high rating for people to go rent it or buy it because they think it's fun to cheat people. You are playing with the time and money of the people you have no right to do. If the movie is bad, give it a bad rating. If it was good, give it a good grade but do not lie. I gave this movie a 4 and I'm glad I could see it for free in my library because this movie was bad and it really is not worth paying a dime to see it.
