It's not as bad as "Nails" from 1992 (where Hopper plays an "unstable" cop) but it's pretty bad. How can a movie with such a good cast go so wrong? This movie manages to find a way. The story was pretty stupid and Hopper's address seemed never to have addressed it before. All the long shots in the beginning were annoying. Lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
