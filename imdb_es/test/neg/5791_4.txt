As a California resident, I would like to see the holes in the law that were shutting down power plants to increase prices and get jail time as well. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. While they clung to how Enron got up and crashed, I found it really interesting. However, when the film focused on his anti-Bush bent, it made me wonder if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It's fine to point out any connection that the Republicans had with Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was the president. The CA energy crisis occurred under the supervision of Davis. Both were in charge during the Enron abuses, but none is responsible in any way. Rather, many minutes are spent on how Bush was Lay's friend. And that? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's room. Why are the Democrats given such a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are a waste of taxpayers' money, so I'm not partial to any of the parties, but I hate to feel subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some guilt, but I really doubt that the only culprits have Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bushs as Kay lovers when the Democrats received as much money from the Enron campaign as the Republicans. As I said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspect the rest of the facts that they expose.
