This movie should be over as soon as the joke about Bebe's Kids is told in the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really fun routines were not meant to be something the whole family could see. Let's compare it with the idea of ​​one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and the attempt to squeeze the joke as long as possible to turn it into a movie. This movie had to be self-service because I can not find anyone who is familiar with the settings or the antics. The funniest part of this film is the value of writers and producers to make it count as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
