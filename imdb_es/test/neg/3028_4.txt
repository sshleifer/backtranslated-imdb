I have seen this movie again and again since it first came out. I was fifteen years old and even then, I knew it was corny. I had great potential and I constantly rewrote the script in my head. Capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. I loved the fact that it was filmed in the place. Pity that the characters were underdeveloped. It is as if they wrote a first draft of a script and made the film immediately. At fifteen he could have written a better script! Some scenes and dialogs seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with many unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did it seem that Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "Elena has become a kind of woman!" And the way he was always touching her. It would have an interesting plot twist, Elena working for her cousin drug dealer who is also a pervert. Too bad they lost the mark in this case.
