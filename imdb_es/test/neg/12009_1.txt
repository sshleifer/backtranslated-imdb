Every time someone tries to tell me they think a movie is the worst (and it's usually a movie that is "great" to hate, like "Hands, the hands of fate" or "The Avengers") I ask them, "Is that a movie about a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to kill adults? Does anyone say the phrase 'I prefer to eat a turd' in that film? "adults, and too violent and irresponsible for children. Is there so much money in the demographics of Beavis and Butt-head to make a series of movies like this one? There is a child problem 3, but I have not seen it. I prefer to eat a turd.
