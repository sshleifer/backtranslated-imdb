Maybe it's unfair that he does not like a movie for what it is not, instead of what it is, but I approached it with the hope that eventually a filmmaker would make a film about rural gay men and women from small towns. Instead, the focus is mainly on outrageous fanaticism (great news!) Of the locals (and those in the outlying areas) and on the appalling torture / murder of a gay youth. <br /> <br /> I spend so much time with stupid people who squawk about AIDS, sin, hellfire and perverts. A lot of time devoted to the macabre preacher who complained that the Bible and homosexual people got what they deserved. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people coming to the "gay bar of a small town", not those who opposed it. Also, the young man who was murdered is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie works as a warning instead of a celebration, and it's very suspicious.
