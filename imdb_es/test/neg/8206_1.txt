If it were possible to give negative stars, I would do it for this stinkburger. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, LOOOOOOVVVEEEE is a good fucking movie. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this movie actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an Academy Award winner! The Dialouge is so unnecessarily long, and mostly used inappropriately. (ie, "Now I'll do it Condensed (yes, condensed!) to your wishes." The performance could have been much better if they had some more logical lines. <br /> <br /> The story? What story, A The earl is exiled because his wife had leprosy? I'm still not sure about it. (Rich?) Does the fleet one and the captain of one of his boats crash on the island? Do people act so little? Naturally, I like camping in B-much, much, of its charm, but this was just plain silly ... it was said foolish: a salt-sea Captian who sounds as well versed as a university professor? of fleet that has no idea how to get there (I felt this guy had no idea how to play, a scene in which he acted in Spanish, the next English / European) The count, who is not sure if he is a reincarnation or really DeSade (do not ask me how DeSade figures in this after 4 beers, my wife, my friend and I still could not solve it. <br /> <br /> The fear factor? I could show this turkey to my little grandchildren and just worry about them sleeping with him. I like it a lot. From the horror movies of the early '60s, and some still have good commotions, but this thing ... never had a commotion, not even a hint of fright. <br /> <br /> The information on the back says: "This movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will overcome your worst nightmare." The ONLY degradation is to LOOK AT THIS MOVIE. It's 90 minutes (the case says it's 74 minutes) of your life that you do not come back. <br /> <br /> I paid only one dollar, yes, one dollar, for this and another movie. I still feel that I am owed .50 cents for sitting in spite of this. <br /> <br /> To summarize, Dungeon Of Harrow did not have ANY so-called Harrow, but it had a beautiful cardboard dungeon.
