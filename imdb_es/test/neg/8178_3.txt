What you need In the run-up to 'What you need', all the episodes since 'The Lonely' have been to some extent winners. This episode is the first major failure since 'Escape Clause'. Serling's script is based again on another person's material, a short story by Lewis Padgett. As with 'And when the sky opened', Serling modified the content significantly, eliminating a scientist and his machine and inserting a larger vendor. <br /> <br /> 'What you need' works best when it comes to being sweet. The initial half, in which the street vendor offers customers in a bar the objects they will need in the near future, has a soft charm that may have worn out during an entire episode, but works well within the allotted time frame. Unfortunately, the main plot that it configures is full of open holes. The minute the episode of Steve Cochran as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus, the episode collapses. The Cochran part is a subscribed stereotype and its flat performance highlights this failure. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable and the revelation that he will kill the old man is not convincing, which makes the whole scene of the slippery shoes look completely false. Ernest Truex is good as a street vendor, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm advantage to the character, but he is not good enough to help the script in conflict. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the weak script is also full. of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the power of the street vendor to provide people with what they need is derived from the ability to see the future. So how exactly does this allow you to produce a feather that will magically choose the winning horses? That seems like it should be a bit out of their power domains. Also, for a man who can see the future, the peddler is certainly surprised to find the hooligan waiting for him in his apartment. There are many more holes that can be selected in 'What you need', but almost not worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see it anyway.
