Do not watch this movie, go see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can not rate this movie better than 3. The performance was pretty good and I really liked William Dafoe as the villain, but I do not see why this movie came to the big screen. The story was ancient and has been shown in more than 100 films and in more than 1000 series / movies. The main problem was basically: nothing is happening. Take a kidnapping, let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man turn over the money, make the police look stupid and bored and extend this to 95 minutes, have your movie "Clearing". The only 2 reasons why I did not rate this with a 1 were a) Dafoe and b) the "B-final plan". There are not many endings you can give to a kidnapper movie ... 75% of this type ends with the A end, 20% ends the B end, and 1% ends with something unpredictable. Bored, bored, bored.
