Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in film history, and God bless him for that. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a really horrible movie that does not live up to its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Exploitation films must be judged by their history, sex and gore. What else is there? This movie fails in most of those reference points. The plot is as thin as paper, placing a nubile young woman in the jungle among cannibals. We did not really receive information about why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, her father is the "Great White Chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting in the trees, naked. Add hunters of fortune and precious stones, and you will have your basic rescue of the girl for greedy intentions. The characters are in existence, not adding an ounce of credibility to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibalistic films. Those who seek that type of blood need to run to the other side. Except for a cheap title, this film has surprisingly little blood and guts. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that the only reason why this movie exists is that Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto could run around naked. Actually, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) He does all the heavy front work, while the two ladies of the jungle have their bare chests everywhere. Yes, there are scenes of love ... probably the most sterile that Franco has supervised. Women are beautiful, but here there is nothing that makes this film an erotic classic. <br /> <br /> This movie just reeks of low budget buffoons. The sets are laughable. The acting is horrible, and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to keep this together, and there is not enough budget (or effort) to impact or shake. I think Franco fans have come to expect more from the master of exploitation.
