This was a strange movie. A bit of horror and undoubtedly the black cinema. Some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. <br /> <br /> Soon, the Lone Ranger arrives at the FBI person, Agent Richard 'Dick' Martin. (Clayton Moore) Martin is not effective in finding the killer, since he is more interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor, who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies, and the doctor is terribly disfigured by a strange serum, the true story of the group appears and that is where it becomes interesting and strange. I will not spill it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful as the hidden murderer.
