This was a disappointment in many ways. Filming the location in Ireland, although quite beautiful at times, can not save this film without inspiration. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and inheriting an enchanted mansion, are simply not interesting characters. Paul, towards the end of the movie, becomes incredibly annoying and one would like him to just close his mouth and shut up, since he seems to be screaming as if it had turned into an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand that is raised over her naked and twisted body . Although the woman is quite adequate to do this, she does not do anything in the sense of history. One is left thinking that the production team needed to spend a short execution time and just released some stuffing and a bit of T and A. CGI effects are also cartoonish and the fiery end of rivals co-executive producer Roger Corman it is much earlier and The film far superior The fall of the house of Usher in all its cheap inefficiency. Any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. If you like the images of Ireland, you may find something here, but it would be better to rent or buy a travel notebook. Skip this unless you are indiscriminate and think that the plot is secondary. Rent another low-budget ghost story (if you can find it) entitled The Woman In Black and see how good and terrifying a movie can be. This was a wasted opportunity.
