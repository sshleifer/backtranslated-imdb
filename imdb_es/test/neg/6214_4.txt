The movie is not bad in itself ... until you see the original movie Hitch (2005) starring Will Smith. The film is a direct copy with even the dialogues for most of the film simply translated from English into Hindi! The plot in the original runs closely. The Hindi version fails to keep viewers interested. The kind of exaggerated comedy of David Dhawan seems to have been exceeded with Govinda shouting hysterically at all times ... sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for this than in the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English, which I guess you know because you're reading this, see the Hollywood original. At least, see "Hitch" if you have seen Partner to be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, I regret to say, is blatantly raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
