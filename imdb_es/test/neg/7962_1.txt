This movie spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However, the plot and the visual elements are so crazy that it looks more like a poster for LSD. <br /> <br /> Argument: Michael's heroic struggle as he fights against his drug addiction while subject to the humiliation provoked. by people like Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there is a good message, but it is obscured by the fact that the writers have taken a rather old-fashioned PSA idea and have tried to extend it to 30 minutes. This includes a sequence of songs, where you are told that there are a million rational ways to say "No!" for example, "I can not smoke marijuana, I have homework." <br /> <br /> Writers can not decide what to do with the characters they have brought royalty-free. At first we see that everyone has to hide from the human characters, but in five minutes we see everyone in sight without anyone noticing. Soon they begin to interact with the human cast, and the only one who is slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug addict, it is the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (Pooh, by the way). Also, there's the little demon drug floating around. Because you know, pushers do not give drugs to children. He is also ambiguous: while it may be a symbol of Michael's addiction and, therefore, should not be seen by other people, he delays and chases little Corey for SHE to drone on drugs. So I guess it's ... uhhh ... moving forward! <br /> <br /> The full plot finally culminates in a sequence of madness in which Michael finds himself in what appears to be the Carnival of Souls on Saturday morning, also known as a Hell theme park where different cartoon characters hit him and ignore him and those things. For example, Miss Piggy eats it in a sandwich and spits it out. If the writers were not tall in writing this, I should recommend that they try to get high because they can not get more crazy than this. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael has been at this point for more than two years, so the reason why this shooting sequence would scare him is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I realize that I am completely mad at this movie, but actually I saw it again because I took the trouble to track it on eBay because of its sheer infamy of being a BAD cartoon. The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take this scene, for example: Michael's father is looking in the fridge for a beer. He realizes that many of them are missing and he mentions it to his wife. The always observant mom says: "Do not worry, you probably drank them last night watching soccer." While obviously we're supposed to be learning that Michael is drinking beer (in addition to the pot and crack), we read more instead and realize that, hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependencies whenever you're an adult . above! Scenes like this are worth the small price tag of this movie. Oh yes, and the fact that you hear Simon the Chipmunk say "marijuana."
