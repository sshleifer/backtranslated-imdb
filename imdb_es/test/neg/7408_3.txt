I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be some curse when it comes to movies about the elusive Bigfoot. There still has to be a film that approaches the subject in an intelligent way, nor one that creates real suspense. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film titled "Sasquatch" (1978) have become minor cult classics, but none was very memorable. Both films were aimed at family-friendly audiences, so they are inhibited from trying to scare someone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big budget movie to use Bigfoot, with an incredible creature design by Rick Baker. However, they also chose to target younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (as did "Bigfoot" in 1995). It's been a long time since I expected someone to approach the subject like a thriller, maybe like "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw this in my local video store, I thought that my dream had come true. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a multimillionaire who runs an expedition to the Pacific Northwest hoping to find his daughter when he was on board a small plane when he crashed in the mountains. The premise is interesting and sounded promising. The truth is that it never builds any real suspense. I was never interested in any of the characters at all, since each of them was very two-dimensional and rather insipid. Even the always reliable Henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance. Every time it appears on the screen it looks boring. It should be like there is no action to talk about during the first hour of the movie. As for the creature, where do I start? I thought that at least we would have a cool-looking monster running through the forest, but instead, we have this bald man (yes, I said "bald!") With black skin and patches of skin here and there. Imagine a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you'll get the idea. Nothing like the work of art in the lid box I assure you. Neglected editing and careless handling also increase the confusion, since half of the time it all seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the movie was constantly being used with these long and slow exits (which did not make sense or had any purpose ). They even stole all of the infrared vision of the creature in "Predator," which seemed too stupid and out of place to be effective. Maybe all this proves that Hollywood should forget about trying to make more Bigfoot movies, since they still have to make one that works. So far, each one has been as scary as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
