The movie is fine if the kids from high school made it for their friends. It is well below the limits that will be called "professional". There is no argument, no actors' game or visual aspect as you see it through the plastic film. I was so happy to have the FF button on my remote control, 32x worked very well. I understand that everyone should start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to bring it to the public. If you are concerned about quality and budget, "Open Water" was made with $ 60000 and more than half was for the guy who provided safety in the ocean and trained sharks. And that movie seems 100 times more professional and it was an event in indy cinema.
