I went through this movie while navigating the channel and it seemed to be another poorly made Christian movie about The End Times (which I find quite entertaining because they take themselves very seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and science fiction material. But it was enough for me to categorize it as a shameful and frightening representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the script was terrible, the performance was mediocre, and the pace was poor. Cinematography and direction were below average: no interesting images, no layered plot, no creativity. Do not just blame the budget, movies can be interesting without special effects. This was not Christian films can not excuse their mediocrity and lack of originality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: the rest of this comment is addressed to Christians ** <br /> <br /> First of all, it is unethical in any business to prime and change your customers. I do not like being told that I can win a free iPod only to realize that I must first spend $ 300 at the participating stores. Non-Christians do not like being told they are watching a science fiction movie and then being bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a hammer. Hidden agendas do not make you win friends, much less converts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, you should not use open threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented the Christians became insensitive and presumptuous thugs when dealing with the skeptical "skeptic": they even stage the rapture to scare and make him believe. Representative dialogue: "Go back to Jesus, or go to hell!" "Well, do not believe me, BUT YOU'LL FEEL IT!" "The day you die, I can guarantee that you will wish you had paid more attention to these things of Jesus, WHEN YOU WILL FIND HIM IN THE WIND OF HELL!" Okay, I may be exaggerating, but it certainly came out the same way. If you believe that this is a "clear message to Christ," you are wrong. I do not remember Jesus using threats and coercion. And I do not believe that people can make an authentic decision to believe in it out of fear. So, Christians, do not use this as a "witnessing tool" for your "unsaved" friends. It is clumsy, offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to characterizing Jesus as a sure means of hell, he did not allow space for debate or discussion and did not attempt to address the issue of whether UFOs or extraterrestrial life could exist. Instead, he offered an answer: "UFOs are the devil's plan to deceive people when the rapture occurs," which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Since the Bible does not mention UFOs or extraterrestrials, you can not use it as a source to draw conclusions in one way or another. The rapture is not necessarily a solid and widely accepted biblical concept, although at present most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a series of popular books. If you do your research (as many of the supporting reviewers suggest), the idea of ​​two coming of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the tradition of the Church, popularized by some itinerant evangelists around the world. The 20th century. Most Orthodox Christians will probably find that the message of this film is a fairly large stretch that is based on a lot of unsupported presuppositions. An accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
