So lame that it's not even funny. A zombie infection surpasses a small university campus and a government squad of secret agents supports a pair of scientists sent to find the source of the outbreak. Collecting the DNA of zombies is surely not easy. Once bitten you are one of "them". The entire university has been completely infected by the race among the undead. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not even redeem the horrible original CASA DE LOS MUERTOS (2003). However, mindless entertainment is achieved. A few flashes of female nakedness coupled with a herd of blood and explosive heads should make any zombie monster happy. Accredited cast members: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Vel√°zquez. The word "F" maintains an unimaginative script.
