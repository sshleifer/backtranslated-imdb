My best guess is that this piece of work will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline jumps all over the place. This would not be so bad if I left some suspense for the end. It was completely predictable. The bitches choose the marginalized, the marginalized ones want to know why they hate it so much, the bitches die of a terrible death, the marginalized ones go to their house and they look crazy. The marginalized girl brought with her evil spirits, makes the neighbors go crazy and kill each other. Spooky child understands what is going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, the sick mother sends her youngest daughter to bring the golden boy home. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some great moments here and there. First, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. More definitive. I did not see him coming. Nor did he expect the wife to put bacon fat on her husband's head. If the movie had maintained that kind of emotions, I would have loved it. The beginning showed a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I did not expect most of what happened, and although I questioned something from the movie, it was still a fun watch. I did not see any preview for this sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
