The first time I saw this movie in the theater I was very angry. In my opinion, it exploded completely. I did not see it for a decade and then I decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is that it was with the sequel 5 that implemented the set "I'm in a dream, my God, I see strange things, oh no, what's happening, oh, it's a dream, it's not a dream, oh wait, I see Something "spooky, oh it does not matter" -sucky storyline, those sequels do not even require that the box be opened, or they stick to the rules of the first 4 movies that, if you saw Pinhead, you're pretty fucked up and dead. Hellraisers adhered to this story that made it so scary in the first place.Nothing fantasy, nothing weird, the box boomed came in. Kirstey was the only one who could negotiate her exit, first for Uncle Frank.So because she had information This movie, at least, tries to stick to all of that, even though it was a bad story, it was still a bit hellish, no, I'm pretty sure that part 5 was the first part to completely and completely destroy the hellraiser series, they are now remaking 1, and I do not even think I see it. Oh, who am I cheating, I probably will and I will probably be disappointed ... again.
