This movie is little more than an ersatz Verhoeven. The filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but it's just disgusting. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that seems to be taken seriously. Brechtian breaks for non-existent advertising brakes are tedious and even painful; Undoubtedly, there was no real intention to make this film Brechtian, it was just an accident that happened like that. If you want to see a reality TV parody, look at Celebrity DeathMatch: it's more fun and more witty, and most importantly, shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain when watching a movie. To avoid like a rabid rabbit.
