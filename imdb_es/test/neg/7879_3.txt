Another French movie with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and fkk. One of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and murders her boyfriend. The second is a prostitute who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend shot dead. After those incidents, they are in a subway station (both lose the last train) and everything begins. They find a limit and they get very close. They sexually abuse men, consume drugs, drive around the country and have a lot of sex. That's all about Baise-Moi really. We can see that they have no mercy with their victims. They even kill a woman for her money. Both actresses are real porn stars in France that affect the film in two different ways. They are so comfortable in sex scenes, however, they can not make it worthwhile to see the whole movie, since, for me, the film does not require more acting capacity than that. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level. I could recommend a lot of things to do instead of seeing Baise-Moi. Therefore, it is annoying to see if you want to see a meaningless and perverted movie. * outside *****
