Is a pile of garbage badly acted and clich√©? Of course. Anyone who does not realize that when he picks up the box in the video store, probably does not have any successful movie in the first place. Therefore, I will now grade the aspects of the film that really interest us on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore: 4 - For this genre, there are very few deaths, and Gore is almost inexistent. Anyone looking for a bit of blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children are doing these horrible things, which raises the bar a bit. <br /> <br /> Suspense: 1 - Well, I feel bad for anyone who is scared by this trio of fools. Looking at children. <br /> <br /> Nudity / sex: 7 - A lot of boobage from three different women, one of which is MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two scenes of sex, but little is shown in them. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor - 4 - There are some good laughs with children who try to act terrifyingly, but in general, it's just bad, it's not funny, bad. <br /> <br /> In general, 4 - Can not unlock. There are some funny moments and enough nudity to keep your attention throughout the movie. However, just watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's movies. This definitely falls at the lower end of the scale, but it's not completely down. The real drawback is the disappointing end. It almost ruined the movie for me.
