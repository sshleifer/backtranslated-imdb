I've spent a year deployed in Iraq, and among the hundreds of movies I've seen here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging by the cover (African-American with rows of corn with a curved blade, a leather coat and the behavior of a tough one), I expected a Blade scam. Fair enough. <br /> <br /> So I introduced it and observed an overweight African-American at the border without blades, no corn streaks and, well, nothing really, except ... I do not know. If you have read any of these other comments, you will get the essence of the movie. It stinks bad. Really bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the Highlander-esquire beam after killing an immortal vampire, or the karate kick sound effects for the camera zoom, or the budget of twenty dollars in accessories, or "Well, we have 90 minutes to film this before they see us filming in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot" or martial arts that are as exciting and accelerated as two older people having sex, or acting in seventh grade talent, or the eccentric Asian master who is senial or is in acid, or what, but the film manages to force you to question your existence. And that is incredible. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like Scanners. If you interrupt (or MST3K) with your friends, this is the movie for you. I've seen it three times already, and I think it could have caused permanent damage to my psyche. If STILL has no clue as to the quality of the film, people would try to give it away for free and nobody would take it. Not even by force. <br /> <br /> In a few words, look at it. Either as a masochistic pleasure or punishment. Your skull will oscillate (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
