Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to see any movie as bad as it could be. This was the hardest part (right after "next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically crap. How can you call it another way? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse to gore and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they've been like that." Good, but why bothers us with that? I do not care if it has been like that (and there are many scenes in which I really doubt it). The point is, why should someone see it? The problem is that there is only one reason why you might like the movie and it is that you like violence. There's nothing special about that, just cruelty. You can say "Great!" as you would say in splatter-slasher-movie. But horror movies with violence can at least give you chills and excitement, maybe the characters that interest you. But here everything is dark, boring and boring. Each character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who can not deal with his power." What? In the first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 and a half hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you get excited to see Helen Mirren, be pregnant and dance. Or 5 minutes of unconditional scenes that some people see as the message of the movie. Or castration, yes of course, that was fun! Real scenes of birth, how hilarious! Humans, animals, who cares, just treat them like toys. <br /> <br /> I do not care what they say, this is not a movie, this is only 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, degrading and disgusting. Go see a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At least those films are not intended to be an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
