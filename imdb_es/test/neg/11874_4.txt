Since Wesley Snipes descended (or ascended) to the world of DTV action movies, the result has been Miss, regular, miss. Unstoppible was weak. 7 seconds was entertaining. The shooter was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank. <Br /> <br /> And what about The Detonator? Anything would be above suffering the Marksman again. But the Detonator has a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and a low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a covert operator, which is not so from the book, that it bursts illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last task ends in a bullet that leaves a lot of bodies, Sonny is ordered to escort a witness; Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) to the USA. UU The problem is; Sonny is being tricked by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes delivers in the action department. It's in half-sheet mode here. It really does. Well, in the first 15 minutes of the Trigger, before going into the pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the Marksman. The place does more than look pretty. There is some conviction in his scenes. Many of the actors seem familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 films of Seagal / Snipes. It's always good to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is telegraphed here. But it's never boring. Running, chasing cars, fights, fights. Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have improved after the farce of Seagal; out of reach. It does a credible job. But it is constantly hampered by the low budget. Enough with the locations in the east of the euro. It's softening the look of the movie. What can not be so expensive? br /> <br /> The detonator ends only on the average. It does not have the worst part of its fun aspect of Seag. to the 'mercenary of justice. But he's not as entertaining as Van Damme's second in command. Not as exciting as Dolph's Mechanik. Maybe Dolph should direct Wesley next, right? <br /> <br /> It is time for producers to produce a little more money and think about these DTV titles with the amount of money they are earning with them. It's fair. Could the result be a big seller maybe? <br /> <br /> Snipes would be wise to try to make this your last DTV action movie. It is sad to see STILL another waste of the talents of this talented actor.
