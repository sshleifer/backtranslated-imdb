Los Angeles, 1976. Independent actor John Carpenter, fresh out of film school and with a movie, his class project, without a budget for the year 2001, called Dark Star, ends an action actor called Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station besieged by a hidden gang in Los Angeles was a minor blow to the autocines circuit and received few accolades from the few critics who worried, but it hardly set the world of cinema on fire, unlike of Carpenter's tracking. up smash halloween (1978). At Precinct, Carpenter was still learning to exploit his almost nonexistent budget by using actors from lower shelves, keeping the action in a tremendously small location and moving the film at a tight pace with a combination of editing, smart camera, work experts and the connected genre. <br /> <br /> No one wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood, especially if the catering bill for the week in the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is more than the total cost of the original. It translates into a certain kind of laziness on the part of a filmmaker: he has a stupidly big union team, a studio and a marketing company, all thinking for you. That's why, twenty years after watching the Carpenter movie, I can still see every glorious moment, from the little girl murdered to cold-blooded shots while buying an ice cream, to the relentless score of the synthesizer. A week after Assault 2005, I remember the immobile eyes of Larry Fishburne's ping pong ball and little else. <br /> <br /> The "forgettable popcorn activist" fits perfectly on top of the poster. It's New Year's Eve at Precinct 13, a station that closes with a skeleton staff to watch in its last hours. On the call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narc now deeply troubled and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his teammates froze in the opening scene; Iris (Drea de Matteo of the Sopranos), a nymphomaniac with something for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a crunchy crunch who is about to retire. As in Carpenter's Assault ..., a bus with four heavy-duty criminals is diverted to the Precinct. All the drunken eyes are on the Bishop, the gangster and capo√°n (Fishburne, still reinforced by his time in The Matrix) who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt on an undercover cop and plans to break the cover of endemic corruption in the unit of organized crime led by Marcus Duvall (a tired-looking Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are off, the power lines are down, and both the criminals and the police are heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed by paranoia while waging war against a workforce of corrupt Duvall police who look balaclavas white, bullet-proof vests, red Bazookas and more hi-tech equipment than the Skywalker Ranch. This, we are expected to create while the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station firing rockets at the windows, is a clandestine operation to cover Duvall's tracks. He could also have taken out posters on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As in the recent re-launch of the seventies genre Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes the essential elements of John Carpenter's original and, to quote the seventies, "do the same, man" . The main question is: why bother? John Carpenter, 1976, is one of the favorite cult among lovers of the genre, but it is scarcely marked in the collective consciousness of the public. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks' classic western Bravo into a narrow, claustrophobic urban thriller for only $ 20,000. Jean-Francois Richet, French rap filmmaker and producer, who professes himself as a fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less concerned about making a tribute to Hawks or JC, although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and insults, and it seems to be an intention compressing both flash and firepower as the multi-million dollar budget can support. The result: some tense moments with POV handheld cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, some ordered plot twists, but essentially a B-grade urban activist with a very inflated price. As for the verification of names of Carpenter, it is pure presumption on the part of the filmmakers who do not bear fruit. <br /> <br /> To Monsieur Richet, I tell him a good trip, and I wish him luck in his musical career.
