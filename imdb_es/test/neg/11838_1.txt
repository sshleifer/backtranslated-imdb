This movie does not even deserve a 1/10. This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the movie were DELIBERATELY copied from Carnosaur 1, 2 and 3. The whole movie "Raptor" was based on the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a copy of "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur". I loved that series of movies and seeing how it is put in a movie that you can not even afford or be willing to COPY without making your own models is what the United States comes to do. I recommend you watch the film FIRST of Carnosaurus (all of them) and then watch this movie. , and you will know what I want to say. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
