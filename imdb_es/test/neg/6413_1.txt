This is the stupidest movie ever made. The story is laughable. His wife and son think he is crazy. Then they do not. Then it turns out that he is and I think they knew it all the time. There's a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault ... also Jim Carey. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took on this role ... this is a sinker career. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years old. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 year olds, which also adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds. Or maybe really 32 year old fools because that's 23 upside down. Or maybe 46-year-olds will enjoy it because half of that is 23. I think that looking for things on the Internet about number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie, unless you wanted to see a comedy.
