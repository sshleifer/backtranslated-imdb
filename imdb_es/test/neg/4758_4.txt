This frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved when I was a teenager, but now I find it quite unpleasant. In the case of attachments from May to September, undoubtedly what is in the mind of the older person is lust or the inability to face the reality of aging, or both. And it is likely that the child seeks the kind father that she (or he) lacked child. These underlying agendas seem to me more pathetic than romantic now; There is also something quite predatory in them. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell was a little embarrassed, and should also, when playing the older lover in this silly story. I was, at fifty, trying to play the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man who has a relationship of romance with a teenager. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout, pretty, shameless and full of vinegar, like a seventeen-year-old girl who behaved badly and who presented herself as a kind of "gift" to the honest and honest scriptwriter, as a topic to be studied . His energetic performance brought me a better rating than what otherwise would deserve this movie. Anne Francis was chosen as Powell's beautiful fiancee, but brittle, and handled her small role deftly. <br /> <br /> Part of the dialogue was also quite fun, so it's not a total failure. <br /> <br /> 5/10
