There comes a time in the career of each renowned actor when they become careless and accept projects they would not have touched with a 1000 foot pole in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? That was a good movie. I can hardly believe that De Niro of "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch "Time Chasers" twice than watch this movie again. If someone offers to take you to see "Showtime" or gives you free passes, or whatever, run as fast and as far as you can.
