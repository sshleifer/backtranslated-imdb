You know, I have no idea what teenage life was like for everyone else, but this does not reflect the people I met and with whom I was left alone. And in case you are wondering ... NO ... we were not pristine / clean cut / Pat Boone type teenagers. (If there was ever such a thing!) <br /> <br /> Look, I am NOT saying that being a teenager is easy. The best, well, actually, the BEST movie for teenagers of this time is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now those kids that I knew and were as realist as they were back then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> This was crap. This was a low rent version of Fast Times and even then it did not do much for me. He had a few moments, but not enough to recommend this, or even to say that "this is how it was for the teenagers in 1982". I could not relate. The leading girl (the girls) did not do anything for me and, please, if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they would have had, in which case, this movie would not have been made. Pure junk and a bad staple to put aside like a time capsule movie for teenagers / young adults in the early 80's.
