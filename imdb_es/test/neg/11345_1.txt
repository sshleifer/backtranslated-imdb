Friend ... I liked both Buffy and Angel as the next science fiction phenomenon ... but this is too much. The worst main actress! Not even David "Hot Pants" Boreanaz is able to save this shit. Is it any wonder that you NEVER see Fox? Blow! We gave him a chance totally, and he continued to stink. We saw four or five painful and agonizing episodes. I want to kill the executives of the SO BAD network! Why is money spent on this nonsense?!?! I do not understand it and I do not support it, so I should NEVER waste time watching this program ... unless I LIKE it when their EYES GIVE OUT OF THEIR PLUGS! <br /> <br /> Shit. Shit. Shit.
