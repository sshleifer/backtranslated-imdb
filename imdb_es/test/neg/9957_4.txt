"according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Crazy scientist George Zucco (like Lorenzo Cameron) creates his formula in an unimaginative way, by mixing human and wolf blood. This causes the beast to rise to the level of Glenn Strange (as Petro, also known as Pedro), who is directed to act as Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men". Johnny Downs (as Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (as Lenora Cameron) are a nice werewolf hunter and a damsel in distress. Certainly, "The Mad Monster" is not a substitute for "The Wolf Man"; but, it is a useful addendum. Black and white grainy photography enhances the misty atmosphere of the cows. "Dios" (uncredited) also initiates a well-done ending. As Blaine (Robert Strange) said, "Mixing the blood of man and beast is a sacrilege!" <br /> <br /> **** The crazy monster (1942) Sam Newfield ~ George Zucco, Johnny Downs, Anna Nagel
