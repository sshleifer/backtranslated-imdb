Barricade finds Alice Faye without any song as a refugee trying to flee China and without a passport. She is in a lot of trouble, I will not say exactly, and even the American extraterritoriality will not help her. <br /> <br /> I mention it because one of the complaints that the Chinese include the bandits that attack The US mission in this history located in the interior of China was that particular institution by which the American courts established by our consulates They judged US citizens who committed crimes. However, we were far from being the only country that did that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story starts with her on a train to Shanghai trying to use a Russian accent. The accent intrigues Warner Baxter, who is quite plastered. <br /> <br /> However, the bandits interrupt the trip and both seek refuge in the US consulate chaired by Charles Winninger. It is the best of the movie and I just wish it was a better story because I liked his character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. He requested a transfer ten years later and that is the last news that was heard. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale aptly put it, he is the true forgotten man. <br /> <br /> Baxter does well in a role that someone like Clark Gable would have done in his dream at MGM. The heroics would have been more natural for Gable than for Baxter, since the mission has barricades and defends against the bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had a number to sing. Why the song of Alicia was cut, only God and Zanuck know it. One thing I'm still trying to figure out is when the inhabitants of the mission take refuge in the basement with a trapdoor, who was left to throw the carpet over the basement door? <br /> <br /> Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But the neglected edition and the faith lost in the project caused 20th Century Fox to launch an unfulfilled project. See Barricade is like eating a poorly cooked meal.
