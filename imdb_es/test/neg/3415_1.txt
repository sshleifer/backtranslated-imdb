This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it on the VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are two bounty hunters in love, however, they are totally opposite. She is ambitious and organized, while he is relaxed and totally scattered. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the bad guys are chasing Jersey Bellini (the character of Dudikoff). This opens the door to the bad impressions of the Godfather, the ridiculous fight scenes and Tony Curtis playing the most effeminate Mafia boss I've ever seen! The ending must be the most incredible scene I've seen in a movie in quite some time. I think the Terminator, even the Matrix, is more likely to be true than this ending! This movie just sucks at the cheap. The script had to have hit someone for being totally ridiculous. However, the green light was given so that this piece of manure could be made and released to the unsuspecting public. I saw this movie with other people who agreed that they had cheated on us. No one in the group could say anything good about the movie, except that it was over.
