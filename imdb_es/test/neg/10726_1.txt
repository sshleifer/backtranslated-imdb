Oh my lord, what were you thinking about this? Not only is it frantically little fun, but worse, a good original was shattered in the deal. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually became the performance of your life in that. Even better than where the slut plays in the other so-called performance of her life. Maybe she is simply flat like a thief. At any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal unite marvelously, so if you even remotely glimpse something funny in this baby, it catches the anvil on which it was struck in a pulp. <br /> <br /> Because very, very little of That remains, to these horror. Nothing in this baby is remotely funny, except perhaps for a couple of moments when Dick and Jane bulge like lepers and can not kiss ... and uhh ... oh, my lord, is that all? Well, it seems that yes. <br /> <br /> It really is such a bad movie.
