For sci-fi fans, this will be better than anything that might be running on television at any given time; that's the best you can say about it. Good points; The repair and sense of humor are less boring than normal in such films, the plot is coherent and does not use any magical mystical revelation. Bad points; writers try to do good science but it falls into direction and production (eg, a rock drill mole that uses superheated rock drilling equipment surfaces below the water without a boiling bubble or cauldron), the characters are cliches and the plot unfolds. It's pretty standard of values. It's fine for a night too tired to do anything else; But do not expect any major building or even talking points really.
