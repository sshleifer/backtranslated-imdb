Imagine the horror plot of movies b more clich√© than you can. Add more holes in the plot than the plot. Have it written by a 10 year old child. Ask the A level drama students to simulate really bad American accents (on the Isle of Man!) Add special effects of monsters that B & W Dr Who lovers will appreciate. Result: duff film. Shoot Samantha Janus by taking off her clothes (make a point of this on the cover) and she will probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
