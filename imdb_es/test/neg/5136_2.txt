This film has good intentions, at least in the message "do not be afraid, no matter how difficult it may be, fear will kill you in the end" It is a good message, but the container is so defective that the message is crushed by bad performance , complete lack of credibility in the feelings, dialogue that is delivered as if read aloud, stereotypes instead of breathing, living people. <br /> <br /> Abuse effects such as slow motion to compensate for a total lack of credibility in the performance and, therefore, a lack of emotional force ... <br /> <br /> The part The suicide of it still reminds me of a low budget movie from the previous 90s, when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an absolute inability to live good and happy lives, and a tendency to get caught up in exaggerated dramas which often involved separation, death or imprisonment. <br /> <br /> If you had focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have been less dramatic, more inspiring. But it is not like that, it focuses on pain, loss and leaves the message only as a theoretical ideal. <br /> <br /> I can not see how this movie can be an inspiration for anyone to go out or overcome Fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel, return to the magnificent "Hearts of the desert" (even better: read the novel!)
