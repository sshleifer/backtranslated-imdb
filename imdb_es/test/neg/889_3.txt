I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests it's a sequel to the first three movies ... which is not. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this movie. Okay ... Reid and Martin were not the most talented and could not take a movie for themselves ... but the trade in the HP franchise seems to me that there could be some kind of reference (albeit minor) for The Movies previous I am sure that all those who wanted to see him were "deceived": they made us think that they were watching a sequel, not a totally different movie with a familiar name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny, and he could not bring a candle to Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the previous films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a great visual distraction ... I have to give this a THUMB! The mere fact of naming the movie "Until the last minute" would have been fine. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) did not participate in the making of this film.
