If you are a normal guy like me and you enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas or entertainment, you may want to skip this one. Honestly, they bored me from the opening credits until the end, but I tried to give the film a chance, and I saw it until the end, just to disappoint myself at every moment. <br /> <br /> The performance was incredibly below average, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialogue, along with an even worse script. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped, and I think the audience is supposed to get a deeper meaning of it, or be able to look over it in some way, but honestly doing so would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The film has a kind of coarse sexuality that is worth nothing more than to wear some tattoos and lingerie. Nobody seems to have any motivation, except to make money with some kind of "investment" agreement that is never really explained. The connections between the characters are not very clear, and there is little or no development of the character. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of sub-culture film aimed at a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute shit, but you can decide for yourselves. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's probably not the worst.
