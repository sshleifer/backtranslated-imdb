The Concorde ... Airport '79 begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) communicates with television news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to deliver secret documents to prove to his boss Kevin Harriosn ( Robert Wagner) The owner and president of Harrison Industries that develops weapons for the army has been illegally selling these weapons to foreign countries, however, Maggie sees that Carl is killed and she barely escapes with her life, Maggie will capture the Concorde to Moscow through Paris the next morning, he intends to blow Harrison's whistle, which is also his boyfriend, which would ruin him.Decided to save himself, he reprograms his high-tech missile launchers 'Buzzard' to intercept and destroy the Concorde during an execution test, killing all those on board and destroying the documented evidence ... <br /> <br /> Airport with the new name re '80 - The Concorde for his films and initial video releases because he launched here in, well, 1980 instead of 1979 this last entry into the airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich and is a notoriously bad movie of the He apparently laughed during the press tests and tests, which led Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really stupid and stupid movie, but in purely entertainment terms I can think of much worse movies to spend 108 minutes watching, I really can. I quite liked the absurd plot about a rich industrialist who wanted to kill his television reporter before she could expose him as an illegal arms dealer, but this guy is not subtle and decides that the best way to do it is to fly Concorde with his own guided missile and then get a Fench fighter pilot to try and knock him down before sabotaging him, so there really are three disaster mini movies in one here, since every time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day. You know that Joe Patroni, played by George Kennedy, appears in all four of Airport's films and goes from mechanic in the first to Concorde's extraterrestrial pilot, I also think it's a bit of bad luck since in the space of nine years he's been involved in four major aviation disasters. I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this and the spell was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are simply dumb, Patroni makes cannon rolls, flies up and out and is a guided missile in a large Concorde, not to mention that he crashed and fired guns through the window to destroy the missile. keeping a calm head This boy is good, very good. Then there is the character, there is a saxophone that plays the black guy who smokes grass in the bathrooms, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. In addition, despite being almost knocked down by a missile and then attacked by an aeronautical fighter, Concorde passengers do not seem annoyed and happily return the next day, I do not know about you, but after that you will probably find it. A safer way to travel and why do not the police or the authorities question anyone? Why is the Captain of the Concorde Patroni allowed to go and sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... The '79 airport is certainly not boring and is full of memorable moments and it entertained me in some way, although it is far from being a good movie and the modern public may not have the patience with that, hell, I liked it so it was a bit silly, but it's not any kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Although the Concorde no longer flies, it is still a very attractive plane and there are many images of it here, which is used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh built. This Concorde was also the same plane that crashed after the rupture of a tire caused the rupture of a fuel tank and the fuel leak caught fire on July 25, 2000, while it was taking off in Paris and caused the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people. on the floor. When it aired on television in the US UU In 1982, almost twenty minutes of new images were included, and most, if not all, were filmed recently two years after the original production was over. I know that the effects here are very important, but I do not think they are so bad, if you consider that this was done at the end of the 70s, I think they are quite good. The camera moves during the effects shots, the actual footage of real aircraft is used instead of toy models which, in my opinion, would have looked much worse and I could certainly see what the manufacturers were trying to do with limited funds and technology limited In a strange way, they are quite impressive in reality without looking so good if you know what I mean. Probably the most action-packed movie of all the airport movies have missiles, planes exploding, daring landings, murders and a guy named Robert Palmer (no, the singer) giving a woman in a jacuzzi. <br /> <br /> The IMDb says that this had a budget of around $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe those special effects are not so impressive after all. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. Acting is not good here, people do not seem worried enough to die. Goerge Kennedy gets bad while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... Airport '79 is fun for bad movie enthusiasts around the world and to be brutally honest, I'd rather watch this entertaining disaster. From a movie that had been nominated for an Oscar for about two hours.
