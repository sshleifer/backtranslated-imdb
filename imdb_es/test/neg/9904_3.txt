What is this!! it is very bad. The animation looks so terrible, it looks like a ps1 game. The actors are horrible, they just can not act to save their lives. I sat through this whole movie and in the end I got upset when I realized that I had lost 3 hours of my life. I have not heard of this movie, did you ever go to the movies or went directly to the DVD? A girl was shot? What happens with that, it was just a stupid movie. They totally copied 'The day after tomorrow'. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. I would definitely recommend to people not to waste time with this. You could spend your time watching 'The day after tomorrow', it's much better. Well, that's what I think about the movie. Actually, why have I wasted my time writing about it, oh dam! It bothers me a lot, it wastes 3 hours and 10 minutes.
