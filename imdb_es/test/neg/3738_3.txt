Famous singers have always had difficulty getting into movies (movies are plagued with failed attempts), and one can follow and speculate on why John Mellencamp never became a great actor. Instead of taking small roles in sincere projects, Mellencamp is thrown directly into the head in "Falling From Grace," which he also directed, and the results are as uncomfortable and inappropriate as that title. The story of a famous singer who returns to his hometown in the woods, opening old family wounds, has a script by Larry McMurtry, but the snaking movie is not going anywhere slowly. The cast is decent cast, including Kay Lenz (who is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the only really strong scene in the picture). As for John's performance, he does not look particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look home; He seems to be avoiding the camera most of the time, and never connects with the audience immediately. * 1/2 of ****
