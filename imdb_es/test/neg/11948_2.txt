There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: horrible. How "Mostly, Martha" was redone is horrible. The title of the movie is horrible. The actors are horrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cuisine and the United States is horrible. If you've seen "Bella Martha", well, that's the original title and it means "Beautiful Martha", this is a punch in the stomach. Ms. Jones' acting is so bad and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better. Not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. And the girl ... it's not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very beautiful, authentic movie ... why was it remade? There was a story ... here they took it out. There is no story ... What will it represent? In a way, this movie was also perfect. Do you know when all the ingredients fit? Well this is the case here. A perfect shit ....
