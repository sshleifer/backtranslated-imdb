While posting this comment, IMDb currently rates Saboteur below 7.3 / 10 of Alfred Hitchcock. Personally, I rate it less than half of that. Honestly, I can not say how such a bad movie could come from what is probably the best director I know. I've seen another 10 Hitch films from the 30s-60s. Vertigo is my favorite so far, while the Saboteur is easily the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier, Hitch used the same formula in the 39 steps much more competently. My recommendation would be to see that in its place and avoid this as the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie that I deactivated before the end and I do not want to go back and see the rest. If you have to watch it, then rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made and buy the DVD in good faith won through Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even a teacher is wrong sometimes, I suppose. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little harder in this movie than it should have been. It certainly is not close to Ed Wood or Hands or anything like that, but there are three reasons why I should rate it so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings with it certain quality expectations. This movie offers some of them, but they are overshadowed by the almost sensible plot. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a little the 8+ ratings that this movie is receiving. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of the directors. Real fans will find reasons to consider anything by him as a work of art, but the high rating on IMDb gives the more casual movie enthusiasts like me the impression that this movie is much better than it really is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 on this. Maybe if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10 it would probably be a little less bitter. ;)
