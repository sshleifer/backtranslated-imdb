Well, it's okay, I've seen Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> It's not something I recommend to people who are not seriously involved in Japanese wrestling movies. This is a kind of Japanese ninja fight movie, with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "Witchcraft Swords". I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I really was not aware of everything. I had some good difficult scenes, but overall it was not to my liking.
