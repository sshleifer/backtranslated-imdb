Since playing as a bully in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / specialist Kane Hodder has been busy. His movie, Hatchet, received all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. I should have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of the slashers. He has played Jason Voorhees since 1988, Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new movie that seems to be a Halloween remake. There is a lot I would call the type of serial killer with his thirst for methodical and inexpressive blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not much blood in this movie and very little action happened in the camera. I felt as if I was watching an episode of real law enforcement at A & E. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Hodder's shoulders completely, since the rest of the actors did not contribute much either. <br /> <br /> Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) only ran his mouth until Gein shut him up. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. The veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but everyone seemed to play their roles.
