Pretty bad. This movie about an old gray-haired explorer (and frankly silly) and his dog "Shep", that is, Lassie, as well as an annoying child whose name I can not remember at the moment. At the beginning of the movie, the old seeker has DELIBERATELY heard about some sand so the poor dog has to dig it up. Why? Did you hate the dog? Anyhoo, somehow or other, this idiot has managed to find gold and tells his partner. But the man is dead, and his other seedy companion is happy to help old Jonathan dig out the gold. The geezer tries to leave is a dog with the son of the dead guy, but not even the delayed mutt wants to stay with this child. There is a quaint old preacher (for a quaint reading that smells bad), and the greasy guy ended up with the old man (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. In addition, it poisons the dog and tries to kill the child as well. So I guess it's fine that a diabolical and crazy Lassie ... er ... SHEP does this at the end, although it's pretty unsettling in what is basically a children's movie. There are extremely stereotyped (to the point of racial slurs) 'Native Americans' who speak without using verbs (as in the Me Make Camp Fire speech). And that's the scope of the cast, because apparently Lassie's salary was too high for them to hire someone else. A little boring. It's not very interesting, and a little too dark. It is not a great movie in any way.
