Extremely boring ... I do not care how many cutting-edge bones you have in your body, this baby sucks ... and you do not see it because I mentioned it, save it for Warhol's "Empire", it's far away. more entertaining! I've seen other Duras films that were much better, so I'm left speechless why this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I have had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in these artists I can still see the artistic intention, the quality and an entertaining aspect in the representation of their art. As for "India Song", which is not even soft porn, Anias Nin was almost here, sex sample with G rating, and a voiceover that is not related to the slide show / movie ... Pure shit and not even countryside ... unfortunately only a hole and a loss of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the impression I saw faded and scratched to hell. (Harvard Film Archive), if I want to see "entertaining and boring" I see Bunuel !! Yes, "India Song": keep your head up until the end of modernism and you will really get bored! Watch a 70's porn movie with all the good parts cut off and lower the sound, you will get "India Song" but with a better picture and nothing of the annoying music nor the cries of the Vice Consul.
