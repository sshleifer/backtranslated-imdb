I am insulted and angry at the idea that NEVER has been undertaken a sequel to "Gone with the Wind". Having said that, I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. The interpreters are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. The hype surrounding this book and this movie is an exercise in futility. I think it will become one of the wrong Hollywood movies. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell have been messed with the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film. The sad thing is that people really made money with this gut.
