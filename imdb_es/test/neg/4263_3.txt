Good attempt to address the unconventional theme of the romances from May to December. However, the treatment is totally unrealistic. Of course, sixty-year-old men may fall in love with younger women, but they are usually adult women with whom they share common interests, values ​​and points of view ... they are not neurotic and immature women who are almost underage. Of course there are exceptions, and they are almost called pedophiles! I'm sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a healthy and skillful sexagenarian wastes a comfortable family life and becomes a joke for his peers ... all for a young man of 18 who does not have a practical thought in his head and that is it behaves like an unstable fugitive from a mental institution. It is not necessary to have a PhD in psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex, and that the girl has problems of abandonment and unresolved father. <br /> <br /> As for the recurring Vijay scene. On the edge of a precipice, contemplating suicide, that is the closest thing to having something in common with Jiah, by behaving like a wounded teenager. <br /> <br /> On a positive note: the actors did a good job. Work, and good cinematography.
