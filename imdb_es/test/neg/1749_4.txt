I liked most of this movie. As other comments have mentioned, it has a good cast, the plot is quite interesting. In general, it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end, I think it's completely ruined, left me baffled. Yes, you expect people to cross and cross each other in this type of film, but quadruple crossing? Well, if it's justified by the plot, why not? <br /> <br /> But that's the bad part, there's no need to do it. After a certain point, everything is plotting without any meaning. (Here comes the SPOILER). After the airport scene, Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the scam. Is everything necessary to rub Federico's nose on the fact that he has been tricked? I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the movie and 2 out of 10 for the end.
