This is a pretty bad image. It offers nothing unique, original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret society in her university is involved in macabre medical experiments. And, of course, she gets involved in solving the strange deaths at school. This movie started promising with some great special effects in which a guy partially dissects while he's alive and tries to escape after he wakes up, but even those flashes and the rest of the special effects pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal-looking blood that these second-class horror movies always seem to have. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the misinterpretation were not enough, this movie had subtitles that often did not even match the doubled-up English you hear spoken and then you add it to the movement of the mouth that does not match the dubbing. movie. <br /> <b r /> At least I had some skin in this movie and, except for a little during the opening credits, this movie did not either. <br /> <br /> This is a boring routine. horror / gore movie --- short on horror and gore. Skip this movie unless "Ernest goes to Camp" is the only rental that remains.
