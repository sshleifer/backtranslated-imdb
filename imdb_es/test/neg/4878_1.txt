After watching this movie, I did not want to get my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted that hour and a half to come back to my life; It was the most incredible and dreadful torture to know that I had wasted the precious minutes of my life in this dreck. I'm marked for life, and since this "movie" came into my life, I've had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress memories, it's really me. . . but I want to burn things. <br /> <br />
