I've been interested in seeing this since it was cited as Worst Film Ever in an entry dedicated to science fiction movies of the 1950s in a British newspaper of the early 1980s entitled "The Movie" (by the way, the guide Leonard Maltin's film also granted this the unenviable BOMB rating). When it was released on DVD last year, I became interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" Box Game in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); However, since I recently acquired QUEEN on DVD-R, I put the idea to it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just found the movie in DivX; however, the impression was not removed from the Warners DVD (which is said to have a surprisingly nice transfer), but rather a muddy TV print ... although not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was how to see the movie in sepia instead of in black). -White!). Anyway, to address the issue at hand: I have to admit that, in a way, I was disappointed that the film was not the laughing festival I had anticipated all this time (Maltin calls it "hilariously horrible"); In fact, I found it quite attractive, and fortunately brief in just over an hour. However, there are still some fun bits left, such as when the old nurse starts screaming at her head when she sees the 50-foot woman, and when the Sheriff's officer almost runs over her boss and the principal lady's butler in her enthusiasm for helping him. In such an unusual case. Neither special effects hit me for being "among the funniest" (Maltin again) in the movie, although they are certainly shamefully bad! <br /> <br /> Well, then the idea that an extraterrestrial (in human form of giant size, dressed in rags of caveman and radioactive to boot!) comes to Earth in a large spaceship with ball shape (!) and apparently, after the precious necklace of the heroine is a complete nonsense, and its almost transparent appearance does no favors at all ... but, in reality, it is human history that calls us Attention (relatively speaking). The character of the philanthropist husband is not very interesting, but his two women are: the wealthy but annoying alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and the ambitious vixenish bride Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative are the faithful servant of Hayes (already mentioned), a couple of policemen (one of them, as pointed out elsewhere, is friendly fool) and so many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [ !] And another a specialist who calls when Hayes begins to grow in size after being exposed to radiation). <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie could be seen as the inverted female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957), although it would not be fair to compare the two more, since the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic has a much more psychological / intellectual approach; Actually, Hayes does not seem so upset with her "condition" and, in fact, takes the opportunity to teach her husband a lesson! However, their uproar, exaggerated in the movie posters of the time, is quite curious (especially considering that it only happens in the last ten minutes); When she does not show the damage caused by her huge but unconvincing hand (especially when she picks up the puppet that is supposed to be her husband!), she is seen walking almost completely and almost behind (with her size even inconsistent in proportion to buildings). she goes through !! Even so, the disappearance of Hayes through electrocution (when he runs into an electric cable) is performed competently. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed this with its new version of 1993 with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature, which I rented specifically for this purpose.
