A Brazilian cable television will present "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month on its channel "Cult". I watched the trailer, listened to the announcement and decided to watch this movie. In fact, it is absurd, absurd, absurd, meaningless, disconnected shit about the conflict in the Middle East, and along with "Soultangler", they are certainly the worst movies I've tried to see. I really lost forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this shit, highly indicated for torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for prizes even in Cannes? My vote is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine intervention")
