This is better than Cronenberg's early horror films, but nothing more than your basic story of what is real. The theme of the video game has also been said before. There is nothing original left, except the strange atmosphere of Cronenberg (which is not so strong here) with the funny sexual references and the dark score of Shore. History never catches your attention. It simply flows forward event after event with boring rhythm. Rating 4/10.
