I hate to comment on something that I did not finish, but if I dedicate a person what I sat for almost an hour before turning it off with disgust, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to see this with an open mind, knowing that it was at the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. Usually, I love raw humor, or at least I can tolerate it. I love the so-called "black" comedies. I'm not easily offended either. <br /> <br /> It started well and quickly it went downhill. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane's toilet), but that was it and it did not make up for the strong dislike I felt. <br /> <br /> I did not laugh When the dog was absorbed by a jet engine. Normally I can not see the humor in the animals dying (except in Animal House). I did not laugh at much more about evil either. I turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that I do not mind repeating the details of, just that the wave of nausea has not yet passed over me. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it was full of details and it just was not fun with almost no plot. This is one of the times when you do not have something good to say, you must spread the word. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
