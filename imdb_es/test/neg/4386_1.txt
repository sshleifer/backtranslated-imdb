This movie was like a meeting of people who had been in other movies and decided to make a really bad movie. I had a guy from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from "The Cosby Show", that idiot who kissed the girl and bought the sausage was in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. OK, that does not make a bad movie in itself, that was something I noticed. Everything with the prostitute and the French girl who had the same name was silly and with 37 people who wrote these notes and if you think they will mix ... shocking enough ... you called it And the bag thing, that was just stupid . It was so bad that I saw the film in two parts and still reached the 50 minute mark. If you're watching this and you're waiting for "Van Wilder" or a movie like that ... Do not do it.
