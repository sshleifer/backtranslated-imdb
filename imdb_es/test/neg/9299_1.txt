I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors headed by Sir Ben, I thought this would be a small gift. <br /> <br /> Oh, how I felt as if my eyes were pulled out when shooting the credits. That I had wasted 93 minutes of my life this movie that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I'm not particularly hard to please comically, high or low, but there really is not a laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben mutters through each line if he is supposed to be drunk or not? 3. There is no effort to start, much less to develop the relationship between the love interests in this. 2 people who hit each other randomly on the street would instantly have more relationships. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted. Do not be fooled by seeing this because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold-ass assailant, he erased more people in Gandhi than this flaccid waste of time (by the way, the stained beards look really creepy). I hoped it was a slow burner but in the end the only thing I could inject. Any life, and justice, is Frank taking out his 9 and taking out the entire cast, starting with Tea and ending with himself, I'm sorry, it was so bad.
