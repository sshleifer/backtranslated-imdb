I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed to find out he's barely in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and who is involved in the love triangle. What a pity, Gabby Hayes has more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie! For many viewers, that's not a problem, but I'm from Walter Brennan's school of buddies, not Gabby Hayes ... although I'll say that his lines were a little more comical than annoying in this movie than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the film very slow, with a complicated plot that was further obscured by the unnecessary secondary plot of romance. By convoluted, I do not mean that it is impossible to understand or understand, I just want to say too messy for your own good. <br /> <br /> Management is not inspired, and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfactory uppance at the end. The whole film appears as fake, unrealistic and badly filmed. <br /> <br /> Just so you do not think I can not find anything good here ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her very brief parts of this film. I'm not sure if it's really his singing, or someone else, but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. Ms. Jeffreys also had a couple of good acting moments. The script needed a lot more of her, or eliminate her character completely. As it was, his good times were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this movie and is the representative of the law to solve things well. Some people complain that their characters before 1950 were too perfect, but that never bothered me at all. I'll bring him something good before 1950, or gritty and violent after 1950 ... in any case, Randolph Scott was a true Western hero. <br /> <br /> It saddens me to have to say it, but I would have to recommend passing this movie, unless you are a diehard fan ... there are so many better Scott films that this one can not be missed.
