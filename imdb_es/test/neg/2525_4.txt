I used to work in the company that originally produced this movie, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies, they did not have much money to put into the production values ​​of their films. It's not that money only buys you a good movie. Look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld, for example. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented person in the company that makes the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. But in Vestron, there was no such person and they always skimped on some crucial area. In this case, it was about the director and the writer. Which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the great cast that this movie has. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this movie was "Let's put a lot of extravagant characters in a room and see if something interesting happens." It's an intriguing idea, but it's not worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Most Vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel. My wife and I developed the ability to detect this quality even in non-Vestron films. Many times, we could even detect that quality by watching only the trailer or the television ad. We sat there, watching the trailer or the ad, and then we went to each one, and almost synchronized, we said: "That's a Vestron movie!" This is a vestron movie.
