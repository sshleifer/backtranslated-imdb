There is really very little positive that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a really unconvincing hero and even more when he tries to go "undercover" as a villain who, we must believe, drinks too much and beats his wife for a bit. Margaret Leighton, since the undercover wife / sergeant is a little more convincing, but it's still hard to believe that any hood worth your salt has not seen through her farce in less than a minute. The plot, about a bullion robbery, is nonsense, and the action is prolonged instead of clinging. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles, is the only flash of light in a totally boring affair.
