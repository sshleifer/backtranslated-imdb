I was told about this movie by a friend who saw her late at night during the week. He told me it was so bad I had to see it! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. It makes you laugh when you really should not. Terrible performance and terrible plot. Besides, does not it look anything like Michael Jackson ?! <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie because it's one of the funniest things you'll ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can not cheat ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the special effects are really incredible ... PSYCHE! The DVDs probably sold out when this movie came out, but if it had the correct form it would be a direct release to VHS, yes, it's SO bad!
