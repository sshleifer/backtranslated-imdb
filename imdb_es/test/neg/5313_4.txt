John Travolta returns to play his role as Chili Palmer, a Hollywood gangster, who now sets his sights on the music business. Using his "negotiation skills", he tries to direct an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get his young singer (Christina Milian) to be successful. <br /> <br /> Before watching this sequel, I had heard it was a terrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a nice comedy even if it is not as good as the original. The film focuses on the music industry this time instead of the film industry. The music business is very poorly represented in the film and they use a lot of unconvincing stereotypes. I can not say whether this was the intention or not, since Get Shorty did a good job of faking the film industry. The same can not be said for the sequel and the attempts are vague. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what prevents the film from sinking. The Rock gives the best performance and it's nice to see it in a different kind of role. Vince Vaughn also offers a fun performance, although he started to get upset before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and does a good job. His performance is a bit boring. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and is not so good singer either. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance, although it is not in the film for a long time. There are also a lot of cameos like Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray directs and does a bad job. He just does not handle the movie very well and the movie is a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it became annoying after a while. Also at 118 minutes, the movie is too long and there are many slow points. The film needed to be edited badly and clearly it was not. Fortunately for the film, the actors can rise above the weak direction and the script and offer some fun scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was pretty funny. In comparison with the original, the sequel is not measured well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rent and that's it. Rating 6/10
