This movie is one of the worst I've seen in my life! I waste my time on this. I saw this movie completely while I took it as a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make a movie like that. It has no continuity. Feel that you just filmed scenes and then joined them in some editing software !! The music is good, of course, but the film does not need as many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut seems fake and I wonder what role Celina Jaietly plays in the film. Bobby deol is good. At least he can act! Upen Patel needs to take some acting lessons instead of taking off his shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> I saw Shakalaka Boom Boom after seeing "300" (the movie), you can really imagine what I felt for this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood but please, directors and producers, be real, it's not all fantasy!
