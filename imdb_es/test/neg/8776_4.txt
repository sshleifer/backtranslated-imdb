I loved this movie when it came out (but I was only 12 years old, and I had forgotten it existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station.) I bought it and could not wait to see this movie that I loved when I was a kid, and then, seeing this movie many years later, it struck me ... Why did I like this movie as a child, seeing it again as an adult? I realized that this movie is terrible. is that they had everything in their place to make the best western in the world and they blew it in. The costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 musical scores, the music orchestra is wonderful, and it keeps alive the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger, the second score is a series of country music songs like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and those songs like "The Man in the Mask" are so bad that they are fun. movies is that it had a brilliant history, and one of the best in the west. However, for a moment it's fun to see John Reid recover from health, after he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed. It's fun to see him grow in his new life and identity as the Lone Ranger, as he concelerates. his identity, and he goes in a race of revenge to make the gang take charge of killing his brother and all of his nursery mates he rode with. But unfortunately, despite how good the story is, everything is ruined by Merle Haggard. Telling everything that is happening (for the love of God, why did they do that?) Between the Narration of Merle Haggard and The Statler Brothers singing cheesy (stupid) songs like "Ride little cowboy" playing in the backgound make this movie be impossible to take seriously. I would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-make this movie correctly, because at the heart of this silly movie there is a great western .--- Described this movie as a beautiful woman dressed The ugliest clothes . I give him 4 stars out of 10, if he is 12 years old and I do not know him, he may like it.
