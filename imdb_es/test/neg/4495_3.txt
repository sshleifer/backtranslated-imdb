I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theater to see this movie when it premiered. Although I suppose that its barely veiled description of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is well done, it is a film that should never have been made in the first place; Therefore, my low rating. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a rich Greek business shark named Theo Tomasis, who falls in love and wins the charming young widow, Liz Cassidy, from a murdered American president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The cast should not be criticized. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon perfectly, and at least it is a consolation, having read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is, of course, beautiful and sophisticated in the part (for all intents and purposes) Jackie, and James Franciscus has the American look of the President. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie since then. He left, I do not want to see him again. I seem to remember a bit of bad language and some general crudeness. Otherwise, I suppose it is a sensational and supposedly intimate vision of the lives of the rich and famous, who have fun aboard their yachts, beaches, swimming pools, etc. Yes, the landscape of the Greek islands is spectacular, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Of its kind, it's fine, I suppose. There is not an end to the television movies about the Kennedys, which I confess I occasionally tune, and not for my credit. This is basically another. Much better to let Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis rest in peace.
