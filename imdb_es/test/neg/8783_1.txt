This movie totally sucked! Do not even rent it! You will hate it! The plot did not make sense, the characters stank, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? If that female penguin would only like it because it has a beautiful pebble, the relationship would not be based on love alone in money! I did not like this movie very much (Hate is such a strong word!). And the penguins can not fly! Even if they think they can do it, they can not. P.S. I'm not who you think I am!
