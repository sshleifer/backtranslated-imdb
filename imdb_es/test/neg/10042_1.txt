I love ghost stories and I'll sit in a movie until it's over, even if I'm not really enjoying it. I rarely feel like I've wasted my time ... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible! <br /> <br /> It was not terrifying in the least. What about the comedic moments of relief? The dialogue was tedious. Acting inconsistent The film was too long and some scenes were drawn unnecessarily in my opening. (Like the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can think of mentioning is that the costumes and accessories were well made. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about other adaptations, but until then, I'll just read about the story.
