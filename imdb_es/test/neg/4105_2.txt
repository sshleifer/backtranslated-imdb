This movie was really bad, simple and simple. How a movie like this premieres is a wonder to me. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it just did not materialize. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his little role in Saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> We are going to address the big problem here. <br /> <br /> The images were so incredibly bad that I thought I was seeing an old one. "Dinosaurs in 3D" Demonstration of adventure of pointing and clicking on the CDROM in Windows 3.1 I mean, I've seen cut scenes in Pre-2000 console games that have dinosaurs with better looks than this. I mean, hell ... the original T-Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. <br /> <br /> The lizard monkeys were laughable. I thought they were a kind of "Killer Instinct" scam. I've seen better sock puppet monsters now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there are a lot of facts for television Movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channels "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this load of "CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz" is openly exposed? I do not care if it's a story of Ray Bradbury. Lameeeee
