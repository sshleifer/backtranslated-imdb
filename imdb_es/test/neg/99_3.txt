Four things intrigued me about this movie: firstly, it is starring Carly Pope (famous "Popular"), which is always a pleasure to watch. Second, it features the brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Third, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was completely disappointed. The whole plot is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. The Pope's performance is fine, but Owen is unfortunately underutilized. The other actors and actresses are all fine, but I'm not familiar with all of them. Apart from the nice riddles that are found throughout the film (and Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the moral of the story is ... do not look at it unless you really want to.
