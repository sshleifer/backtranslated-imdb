Hi guys, this is my first review and I should have chosen the worst movie to review. As I only saw it for 5 minutes, but trust me, you could see that this movie was not going anywhere. The performance was deplorable, the work of the camera and the lighting seemed to have been filmed by a group of 10 years. No offense to children 10 years old. I could not take it anymore. I got up from the sofa, took out the DVD of The House of Adam from the DVD player and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you are a fan of Colin Farrell, this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, is a Colin Farrell who looks like. But that's it, he will never have the skills to act as a col. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (horrible) only because there were no disadvantages in the drop-down list.
