After the exuberant and inspiring aerial shot in rapid motion at the opening of the film, this became a complete boredom and a note of a tone to the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start, well, I'll start with the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all one-dimensional types and idiots who had "Victim" or "Asshole" written on their foreheads from the beginning. As someone who did not see through the owner of the store, Lealand Gaunt (in a hammy and an out of place performance by Sydrow) surpasses me. <br /> <br /> This film lacks emotion, suspense and in a sense, yes, entertaining values. It stretches for a long time without paying much. Why introduce too many types of annoying and fast characters, and then forget about half of them in half? In the book, virtually everyone who entered the store had a spooky fate. Here, in addition to one of the only decent scenes that were translated well from the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), was a disappointment and did not have many balls. I'm sorry, but afterwards, a death off the screen, a boring shot, some disputes and then a couple of explosions just did not do it for me. The brutality and pettiness of the book were sadly missing. The explosion of the church scene was so exaggerated and badly executed, was the whole city suddenly in a fight? It did not make sense and the characters that did not show up suddenly are who these people are and why I should care. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had an impulse. I thought that Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this, but the movie does not give them enough substance for me to care. Amanda Plummer was believable, but too pathetic to be really understanding (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character), here was also a note. J.T. Walsh was entertaining, but the paper was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too elegant for the material it supported. It stood out as the sore thumb. Easy friend, easy. Something a little less theatrical than I would assume would have worked. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that part of the blood he managed to have was good enough, I guess, the director seemed to slow down many times though. If you are going to make a film that reaches the 2 o'clock point, make sure you have many more novelties than this adaptation disaster of the best Kings novels. <br /> <br /> I often found myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be taken seriously (the speech of Ed Harris at the end, or the character Hugh Priest in general), and I was bored and disinterested most of the time. weather. Personally, the director should have done much more with this story, his approach is too docile and hides behind a clear cinematography to be a decent movie. The movie looks good, but not the look that I think this story deserved. I mean, this guy directed ALASKA, it's not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I prefer to read the book, as you would do it, as if it were much more entertaining, a development of characters in layers, frightful violence and chaos, an unpleasant sense of humor and much more. This is a massacred version, which does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** outside of ****
