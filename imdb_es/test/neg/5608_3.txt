Simply putting this movie is without any substance at all. Just take my word and save yourself the time it is a full DUD! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional, but that would imply that there was some kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts was going to jump any time he was so close to the B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> That 70's girl is beautiful ... but unless you're a fan of her, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie went directly to DVD for a reason ... that being ... it's a train crash!
