CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ for 5 stars) A miserable excuse for a movie ... that you could enjoy if you really like the boring and absurd jungle movies with scenes of graphic violence. A couple of drug traffickers fleeing the mafia travel to the jungles of Paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine. They meet another young traveler and his two warm companions, one of whom is an anthropologist who seeks to prove definitively that cannibalism does not exist and has never existed. One of the two traffickers turns out to be a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives to tell him where they hide their jewelry. (And how could they even tell him when he does not seem to speak his language in the first place?) Well, suddenly the natives are not very excited about the white people in their jungle and they are all caught for some retaliatory torture. Bad performance, bad plot and bad direction. It's not a decent moment of suspense in all the sad 90 minutes. Even special effects are not particularly convincing (although a couple of shots will still make most viewers shudder). The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their interpretation of "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the film, but it would not surprise me if many viewers were not saying exactly the same thing at the time: "Oh, God, let her die soon, Oh, let her die soon, and let me die too soon, please" .
