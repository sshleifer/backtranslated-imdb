Wow, there's a lot of poison directed at this movie, and it deserves a lot, but it's not the WORST movie of all time. (Probably "Zoolander"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or you're just in the mood for a "B-minus-minus" movie you can make fun of, this may be your cup of tea . <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an update of Bram Stoker's novel. Two of the main characters are called Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is the Demeter and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. Later you discover that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original, and it turns out that he is on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and to add to the originality, this "spooky ghost ship" movie has another character named Ash. Does it sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There is a development of thin characters such as paper and anachronisms like the manual wheelchair mentioned above, and Coolio and Tom Lister talking about the black jargon of the twentieth century. But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If THAT is what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours have been a waste. <br /> <br /> Like I said, you want a silly movie with "Mystery Science Theater", and your mind is in about the same way required to watch the episode of "Great Vegetal Rebellion" of LOST IN SPACE, then you can find this detour. Otherwise, putting a stake in it is done.
