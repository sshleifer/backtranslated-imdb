This was just a television broadcast here in the United States. Others have commented on the fidelity (or lack of it) to the novel; The 1983 BBC version is far superior in this and all the others. Given the novel's scope, it should not have condensed to 85 minutes. The key sections must be hurried or alluded or omitted; there is barely enough time to enter the chronology of events, so we must sacrifice the development of character: we can not give an idea of ​​who the people are, what steals what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br /> An important negative aspect for me was the cinematography, which I found horrible, and literally sickly. The camera is constantly making ultra zooms and spinning in circles. Maybe in a small TV box this is fine, but on our 40 "HD screen it was so literally dizzy that my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (I had run out of Dramamine's supply). Of course, this distracted me from the rather tarnished performance of "I'm just reading what's in the script" (the isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). <br /> <br /> Adding the score So far, in the Complete JA Draw: I would rate a "Northanger Abbey" as a success, because of the superior direction and production values ​​(and the story lends itself better to the short treatment), the "Persuasion" is fine (although it is not the same as other versions, with condensation again guilty), much later in this attempt, I hope that the two remaining novels of this TV reader, Jane Austen, look better, I am grateful that they left alone P & P.
