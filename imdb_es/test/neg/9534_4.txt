What a waste of talent, although it seems that Crudup in real life is much more like an insensitive, self-absorbed and characterless character that he portrays in this disappointing film. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes empty spaces reveal more than painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconsciousness and the unresolved, contradictory / competing impulses / consciences of the director / writer of the film. Unintentionally, it shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved and deeply conscious character should have and be tormented to merit empathy or sympathy from the audience OR the lack of which is used as a warning to the audience. But this movie fails at any level in that sense. <br /> <br /> The fact that Cal, the main character (largely an Antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone. , especially those who deserve it most (which DOES NOT include it) and who have so much exaggerated, authoritative, self-pitying sympathy, plaintive sympathy only for himself, combined with the stamp of lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or conscience of his impact on others, all converge on this film to make it the epitome of the self-involved narcissistic sociopath, arrested from development, somehow this is now the gold standard for men in the cinema and in the world at this moment and moment . <br /> <br /> One of his counterpoints (James LeGros) says with a true laser flash: "I bet you have not done anything good in life, and I bet you will not." Capture the absolute essence of the character cal. Something that the other characters that are sweeping through the film seem to realize quite quickly even though the director stacked the cover to manipulate compassion for Cal. That is a testament to the talent and skills of the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The 'return' of Cal has nothing to do with the development of the character, the transformation or the evolution of consciousness. It only has to do with the maximum capitulation that, until something better appears, he can also be back in his comfortable and comfortable status quo of the entitlement of the right, where living is easy and nobody will demand that it grow, something of which he is voluntarily incapable and not interested in doing. <br /> <br /> The film could have been accurate and intentional to show traps and tragedies, the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience / conscience, but it has excuses and instead glorifies it: Fact, it revolves in self-pity along with the arrogant, selfish and emotionally atrophied main character. <br /> <br /> (and I'm sure it made me shiver when I thought about the recent revelations about convicted murderer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in its fullest view and full of exciting potential that has never really been realized in my opinion, see the underestimated "Invent the Abbots". ...
