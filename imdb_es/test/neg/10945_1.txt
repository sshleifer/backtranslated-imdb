Now, I like Bollywood films and I am very happy that they have recently been successful in the United Kingdom. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a very flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood version of Amadeus was quite exciting, until the two supposed 'musicians' appear. on the scene as if they had never touched a manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very handsome man and the film shows his narcissistic sensibility, but he is never credible as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting, all you can do is stand there and pout. His expressions, hair and clothes look the same in everything, including the scene in which he is supposedly "dying," when in reality he seems to have only a slight snort. Bobby Deol, playing the role of Salieri, does his best to animate the little wooden script there is, but, unfortunately, he shows himself a bit angry when he is supposed to be full of jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely recognized for their dazzling sets and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a BBC drama reproduction. In fact, the closest thing to what Shakalaka is about is Hollyoaks, as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people who look, well, beautiful. "It has not yet reached mediocrity", the same could be said of songs totally forgotten. <br /> <br /> In summary, Darshan's latest offer has no boom, bang, wallop or twang. Instead, he simply steps along with his head down in hopes of drawing his attention with a gentle touch on the shoulder. And that is not enough at all.
