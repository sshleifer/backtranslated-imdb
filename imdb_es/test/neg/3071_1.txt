Whoever reads these comments may think that we can have a great movie in hand. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this movie has become a blockbuster in Portugal. You can not really call this cinema. The direction and the "staging" are basic (even Ron Howard does better!); the script is bad and pretentious (a really bad tarantino); The cast is covered in TV stars, models and reality stars that have nothing to do with acting. When you put these ingredients on a movie, of course, fans of this type of television show will see them. I'm also surprised that the people who make comments here on IMDb say that this movie is a masterpiece. I thought that this site was only for people who really like the cinema and who understand a little. All the films made to be box office successes in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always horrible. If you think this movie is reasonable, do not say your love movies and your movies.
