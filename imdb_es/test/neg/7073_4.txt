The teenager Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has it hard. She is ridiculed by all popular "kids" for being shy, reserved, slovenly and for her interest in witchcraft. All soccer players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article about steroid abuse for the school newspaper. In addition to this, his father is a drunk, his mother is not close and is secretly in love with his supportive English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The popular children prepared a cruel joke to humiliate her, kill her accidentally during a fight, bury the body in the forest and make a pact to keep quiet. To her surprise, the next day, Tamara returns to the classroom with a seductive look and, uh, dressed to kill. Yes, back from death and ready for supernatural vengeance against all involved. He also takes time to have his sexually abusive dad eat a bottle of beer and tries to seduce his English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor. strictly mediocre. You can also say that the people responsible for this have seen films such as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) because they are lent to the wholesale of the three superior films. There is some blood (a guy who cuts his ear and tongue and then stabs himself in the eyeball, probably the best part), an unpleasant scene of vomiting and a few simple and witty sentences. It's not a horrible movie, but not much originality either.
