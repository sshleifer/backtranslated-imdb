Is this a bad movie? Do not take my word for it. Consider the following press reports from people who tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 路 While I was watching this movie, the brain of Mr. Harold Faber from Sandusky, Ohio, was forcibly expelled from his skull to more than 200 kph and preceded to writhe on the ground screaming NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> 路 Ms. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired domestic worker, performed a seppuko ritual with a butter knife while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 路 Ms. Janine Hosmer, of Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie, even though she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> 路 While watching this movie together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells, from San Francisco, California, exploded spontaneously with such force that Mr. Wells's lukewarm left was then embedded in the wall of a house in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who did not suffer more serious effects as detailed above, after seeing this movie, at least 75% became incurably, violently and understandably crazy. Of the remaining 25%, most were already crazy before watching the movie; the rest were blind and / or deaf or in a persistent vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying do not rent it, if you want. I'm just reporting what was in the newspapers.
