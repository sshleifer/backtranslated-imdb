I am a fan of Ed Harris's work and had high expectations about this movie. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a great advantage for a director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie in Harris's filmography and getting involved with it was a big mistake. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things was a disappointment due to the loss of talent as an actor. The story in general seems too incredible and false. I do not know if it's because of the book, because I have not read it. But if the script was so bad, I can not see the reason for filming it. Maybe it was the commercial success of King's books, or the need for low quality films for the VHS era of the 90s. However, whatever the reason, this movie was a very bad choice for everyone involved.
