What a pity. This could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film can not decide if it is a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine type) or of being an insightful satire about ancient East Germany and its customs. However, his attempts at the latter fail completely. The film does not stay well and the ending is very artificial and incredible. All the stereotypes that one may have about German comedy are sadly reinforced. <br /> <br /> The characters are one and all stereotypes, and the main character, played by Kim Frank, is colorless in the extreme. He simply can not take the film and seems to have been chosen largely for his baby face. It may not be all the actor's fault (he's a pop singer), since the script does not give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> One plus: the recreation of the "style" of East Germany and The period is good. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that the film feels somewhat dishonest and degrading. The film seems to have been produced by people who were not necessarily giving their best and who only wanted to make money with a few laughs. (If they were giving their best, it's a sad case!) I saw him in the cinema with an audience from East Germany and I felt sorry for them. The regime of the GDR was horrible in almost all aspects, but those who lived it deserve better than this.
