Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the best comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with the Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap films, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood films. Most of Laurel's "parody" movies are just a little funny, and even less fun for modern audiences who have not seen the original movie that Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, 'Mud and Sand' monopolizes a film that is still well known: 'Blood and Sand', starring Rudolph Valentino. 'Blood and Sand' was released just nine weeks before this parody, giving you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films were released, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Several sources (including IMDb) claim that Stan Laurel's The character in this movie is called Rhubarb Vaseline, with an 'o' ending. I have projected an impression of 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in Hobo typeface), so I report that Laurel's role was actually mourned by the rhubarb ruin, with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaselino' is more fun. Laurel copies the elaborate sideburns that Valentino used in 'Blood and Sand' (I should have lengthened them!), And there is a parody of Valentino's dressing room scene from that film, which caused the viewers to faint in 1922. A young lady called Carmen in the original movie is parodied here as Caramel (a girl I would like to sink my teeth into). <br /> <br /> This movie (like the original) apparently takes place in Spain, however, there is a gag ban. . Laurel wears a distinctive hat gesture that may have become a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive twiddle), but I've never seen him in any other Laurel movie. There is an entertaining dialogue: the rhubarb vaseline tells the other killers to "keep a bull for me". When Vaseline becomes a successful bullfighter, a footman says "The bull does not have, sir" ... which is fun, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not answer "Without WHAT?" <br /> <br /> There is a funny moment here that almost certainly was not planned, when vaseline shows up for bullfighting auditions. Laurel enters the bullring and, before you can say "beloved crash", throws a bull over the fence, where it lands with a blow near the other auditors. The bull is obviously false, but the gag is funny anyway ... and, yes, there is a title card with a joke about "throwing the bull". The fortuitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and Vaseline throws a second bull over the fence. It lands on his butt and swings upright for just a moment before falling off. Very funny! If someone planned that joke in this quick comedy, I greet the unknown gagsmith ... and the technician who manipulated the bull to land in that position. Most likely, it happened luckily, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it. <br /> <br /> During the silent era, every time Hollywood made a big-budget movie that took place anywhere people did not speak English, it was a common cinematic device to display a piece of text or an inscription in the local slang and then dissolve in a photo of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here: we see a bulletin board outside the bull run with a message in Spanish, then it is dissolved in the same text in English. Unfortunately, the photography in this cheap film is so dark that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> The actresses in this film are attractive ... including Broncho's wife Billy Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel's wife, Mae Dahlberg; the latter makes a nice little dance. (Mae had danced in Stan's vaudeville act.) I was surprised to see Wheeler Dryden, Charlie Chaplin's stepbrother, in a short role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand', Laurel offers a fun performance that does not look like her most recent Stanley family character ... but this movie is much less fun than her brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's last American film, 'The Bullfighters' (1945), he again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his voice in Spanish post-dubbed) . Coincidentally, that movie used footage from 'Blood and Sand': not Valentino's movie, but the Tyrone Power remake. 'Mud and Sand' is more fun than 'The Bullfighters', but not much.
