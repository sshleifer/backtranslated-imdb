According to most people I know who saw this movie and the reviews I read, it was supposed to be an enormously entertaining thriller that, therefore, should be seen by more people. I did not expect this movie to impress me, but I certainly did not expect to find this mediocre movie at the best of times, which is what it is. <br /> <br /> I'm no stranger to French films. French and having studied them as students, so I am aware of clich√©s and corny twists that may go unnoticed by the English / American public. There are some great French films that should have premiered internationally, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the plot is very remote, more complicated and too smart to be entertaining. so you really feel every minute of your execution time of 2 hours and 5 minutes and by the time everything finally unfolds, you are beyond care. The main character himself lacks real charisma or even talent to act, and his attention is mainly focused on him and his trip at any time near the end of the shit, so when he has already considered swallowing the main turns of the plot, has begun to realize. that you have wasted your time! In fact, I remember having disconnected before the credits started rolling after the climactic meeting of the film, that was the point where I was sure that, by the way, I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> The movie is not At all the worst I've seen, but it seems completely overrated. For example, I read somewhere that surpasses all Bourne Identity movies in terms of suspense or even that it has "wall-to-wall tension". I can safely say that some people are promoting this frankly boring movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generously considered rating for this film that I feel, and as I have seen some stinky and complete stinky, therefore, keep the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.
