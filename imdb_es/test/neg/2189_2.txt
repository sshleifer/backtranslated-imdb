It starts pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to Los Angeles. But everything falls into place too quickly. There is a decent plot twist towards the end, but there are so many scenes that do not make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) arrives at his house angry and ready to confront people and takes the time to settle in the club, when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere. I do not want to spoil it, for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the performance, which was not bad from the beginning, becomes bad towards the end. Do not bother unless you want to see how bad it is.
