Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly forcing his tough dialogue and then giving them all evil eyes all the time. It just was not believable, it seems like it's trying to be a tough and stinky one. I only remember him as the millionaire father with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two ... so, this is a big change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean, and he dies (as usual). Only this time it was not impaled on a ship anchor (Patriot Games), destroyed by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye), or run over by cows (The Field). He received a shot, very fast and civic, and that was all I got from this movie that did not kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I was just watching him for the 3 seconds that Sean was, and then the rest was trash. Actually I tried to see and understand the plot, but really there was not one. It seemed a bit like Mission Impossible with the hole, "Oooooo! There's a mole! He's the leader of the group, and NONE EXPECTED! Let's catch him! Let's frame the good man down so we can escape! " Clich√©d and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
