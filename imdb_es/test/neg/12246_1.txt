I take the responsibility of The Comebacks to anyone who has enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You encouraged the Fox studio to continue producing desperate parody movies, and now we are facing what is perhaps the most lazy and desperate of all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck, it just qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved in this mess, could have been fooled into thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something really miserable here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, focuses on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Just when I heard his name in the first two seconds of the movie, I knew that a long movie was waiting for me. Funny names are rarely fun, and they become less fun the more you listen to them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), has given him another chance to train a high school football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them ways to inspire clich√©s of sports films. He expects his children to have low grades and problems with alcohol, and ridicules them when they do not. When it seems that the team has the opportunity to play in the great WC Bowl championship game (did the 10-year-old children write this script?), Lambeau is surprised to discover that Freddie is the coach of the great rival team that his team is playing. against It turns out that Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to take the coaching position, because he wanted The Comebacks to lose. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks is a film so forced and pathetic that I can hardly believe what I was seeing. Faked films have recently become a game of "finding the reference of the movie", and this continues with tradition. Try to include as many references to other sports movies as possible, but do absolutely nothing with them, waiting for us to just point to the screen and laugh out of familiarity, or try to be funny and fall flat. face. Some of the films that are referenced include Field of Dreams, Bend it Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait, was Dodgeball no longer a parody of inspiring sports movies? So, in other words, we're seeing a parody of a parody of inspiring sports movies. If that makes any sense to you, you are just the audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these films are referenced in the plot, and others (like Rocky's) are released for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to refer to as many films as possible. There are some that the film even feels the need to explain to us in their dialogue, in case we have missed the obvious reference. You know that a movie is in trouble when it has to tell us its own jokes. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the screenplay of TV veterans and novice writers, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, do not even know the first and most important parody rule: you have to do it directly. The actors have to pretend they are not in the joke. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers films like Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are remembered so fondly is because they chose serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before resorting to comedy) and Robert Stack, and then he threw them into ridiculous situations. What made it funny is that they acted as if they were not in a comedy and kept a stone face to the rarity that surrounded them. Those films would not have worked if they had played their roles widely. The Comebacks proves it, since all the actors are forced to play their roles so foolishly, it's as if they were screaming at us to laugh. David Koechner keeps waving his arms, bulging his eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs to the point that he looks like someone who knows he's stuck in a dead-end comedy, and tries to pretend he's having a good time. . The film also does not understand the art of famous cameos (it is also an important factor when it comes to parody films). What kind of cameos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> At the moment the movie threw a musical number out of nowhere and extremely useless to Journey's "Do not Stop Believing" for any reason, I was about to do it. Ready to go out the theater door. I was the only person in my projection, and the thought of this movie on its pathetic path to a completely empty house appealed to me. I sat for the rest of The Comebacks, and was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox has not yet finished with the parody genre. They have a parody of 300 that will be released next year called Meet the Spartans. I would say that it can not be much worse than this, but I have seen the trailer and would not want to wake up your hopes.
