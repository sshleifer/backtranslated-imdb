Excellent cast, but unfortunately a lot of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One does not feel satisfied at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist. <br /> <br /> I had that familiar feeling of "Curb" without my daring to say it, Larry as the annoying opposite Pole. The music was there, the 'show nothing' scenes appear, but without any thread or common suspense, it fails as a solo project that ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: The title of the film talks about Cheese but she prefers rice pudding. Is cheese a better-selling title than rice pudding? Prefers any junk food, regardless of the expiration date. Maybe I want someone who eats 'cheese dogs' or ice cream in a pirate costume to have at least some scenes together. <br /> <br /> Marty: this is not funny or exaggerated. People just do not care about a "show" inside a show. A coffee table on coffee books was more fun. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of the cast, save time and eat some cheese. You do not even have to be with anyone.
