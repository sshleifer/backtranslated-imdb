And again, Columbia Pictures decides to simply "hash" using the original version with Curly and without any joke or joke! Towards the end of this unfortunate film, when Joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio did not even make a great effort to re-record the sound, because if you listen carefully, you can continue here. Also, when Moe and Larry throw the darts to "slow down the bull so it can be released," it rises from the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry "magically" look 15 years younger. Why, oh, why did Moe allow all this to happen? It's a hot question that probably can never be answered because, as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any kind of criticism and had pretty high standards for his work, like Larry, Curly and Shemp. Do not waste your time on this.
