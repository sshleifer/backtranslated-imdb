I attended a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and disconcertingly) positive, I must tell you, without any kind of ax, that this movie is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and sincere performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misplaced in what is probably the least polished and clich√©d script that has received the green light in years. I do not know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure he could not have reached the depths of the Dante style he achieved. As brave as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing that these brilliant actors did was to trust such a terrible director and a huge script. <br /> <br /> You should throw pretty well in the boardroom, because you should never do it. He has been allowed to be within a hundred meters of a camera. The dialogue is so shamelessly artificial and clumsy that I actually found myself blushing during the screening. I am mortified that Macy's talents have been totally wasted in the hands of someone whose address is as incompetent as her writing. <br /> <br /> Watch as talented actors as Alec Baldwin working through Kramer's dreadful script and awkward direction. It was similar to seeing a baby seal being beaten to death; I felt angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always glad that there are investors and industry people who are willing to take risks in extravagant scripts with interesting places, this image was a total and absolute fiasco. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he himself had carried a steel tube up to his knees. I hope for your good that everyone can avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy crouched wisely by the side door and did not even stay for the projection. Unfortunately, it seems that the bad luck of the main character has been erased from the image in the worst possible way. Anyone accustomed to quality independents will probably find it completely unbearable.
