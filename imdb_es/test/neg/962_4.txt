The 1950 Rudolph Mat√© film was renewed for the 80s, Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university professor who used to have a successful career as a writer, but that has now gone adrift along with his marriage. The initial exposure plants the idea in the minds of the spectators that everyone has something against him, so that when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not so surprised, unless he is familiar with the original . Dexter, after being told he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to follow in his footsteps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they discover that they have many obstacles in their way. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a promising black and white, while Dexter staggers in the rain to the local police station where he wants to report a murder ... his own, but the pace of the 80s Huey Lewis style that accompanies this scene only serves to eliminate any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, it's just a question of how bad? Indeed, we will soon use the old flashback, but now the film uses full Technicolor. There are some short tributes to Noir, since the hugging couple is standing in front of a Venetian blind, but there is really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are horrible, Ryan in particular is doing his usual dizzy blonde with a smile routine of cutesy cake. The film is a lazy attempt to put a little unnecessary margin on a film premise that is already good, obviously, trying to take advantage of the audience of Body Heat, the apparent results are undoubtedly aimed at an adolescent audience and, course, they are welcome. 4/10
