I am sorry for all of you who are not family with the Lynches. <br /> <br /> My sister-in-law asked me how you can make a disturbing movie. I told him that if the daughter and her father did not make these films, they would have to go and kill and cut people to pieces. <br /> <br /> After every Lnych movie, I tell myself, over and over again. Half an hour lost from my life. But next time I'll check the name of the director or the producers. <br /> <br /> So, you do not want to get angry with yourself and waste time, do not look at it. But if you think you need to kill someone, look at him, this is probably a better medicine than spending your whole life in a prison for mental illness.
