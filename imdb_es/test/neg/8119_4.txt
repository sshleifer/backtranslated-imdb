Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the beautiful adopted daughter of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; his uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), disgusted at not having left the business to run, orders a blow to his niece. When Chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong room of the hotel by mistake and hits the Invincible Man (Jung Yuen), they confuse him with the murderer and send him to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with the beautiful heiress and ends up swearing to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men, while Kensuke is worried playing an arcade game with policeman Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance, and takes control of the business, but runs into a place of annoyance, when his gangster gangster threatens to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them to total control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke joins two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo) who are hunting invincible. Learn Kung Fu and try to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A mix of broad slapstick humor, spoofery and fighting scenes. No Problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved: the 80's kung fu superstar, Yuen Baio, achieves a few fight scenes, but he's getting a little old for acrobatics these days; director Kar Lok Chin offers the kind of silly parody trap he would expect from a Scary Movie; Jung Yuen resorts to making fun of his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee ?? Well, Sam Lee is as annoying as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like gangster Ben, impressed me; has an obviously strong presence on the screen that has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood, since then he has participated in two of the Matrix films and will soon appear in the O.A. edition, directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is pleasing to the eye and should go much further in the movie business. <br /> <br /> You can have a lot of fun working what movies are being parodied, but at 104 minutes I found this movie a real task to sit down. If people who pull funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects make you burst with laughter, then No Problem 2 could attract you. Otherwise, I would be fine alone.
