Only ONCE, I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent scriptwriter, director and producer! JUST ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. The screenwriter must be shot for bastardizing Koontz's work in this way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is a well written story, but the script is pretty boring, amazing and horribly executed. The only elements that work are the performances of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they have never paid the attention, the support and the talent they deserve. If they put the same money in Koontz's work that they go through the barrels in King's, Koontz will rise quickly. But Ay! Without powerful people who believe in their work, I fear that you will never have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a great party. As an independent film, it was not so bad, although extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and a terrible, rigid and unprofessional dialogue that should never have reached the final cut. This film failed miserably to live up to its potential. If they had followed Koontz's original work, a little more closely, and had invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a much better effort. <br /> <br /> However, all I can see in this, is how good it could have been, and it was not. <br /> <br /> Rate a 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
