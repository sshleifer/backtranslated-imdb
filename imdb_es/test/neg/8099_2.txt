First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not in 1942. They did not have to predict the bombing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nobody noticed these six industrialists / lawyers / what was missing for quite a long time? They were killed * before * the surgery was carried out. Third: how the hell did Lugosi get out of the taxis without being seen? Fourth, why did the Japanese not only kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a comfortable partner and his surgical team? Fifth - oh, what's the use? This movie has some interesting moments, but when they explain what is happening, it is likely that they have stopped seeing it. If not, you will not mind.
