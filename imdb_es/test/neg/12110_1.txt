The director of this film is a famous French television presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible film is absolutely in his image. It is the story of a retarded young man, called "Zep" (sic). One night, he sees his sister's sexual relationship and decides to do the same: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is placed in an asylum and his unfortunate girlfriend in a clinic. A man will find them. A man will gather them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel from hell. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With an excessive use of clich√©s, we will see how Absolute Love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with his rapist. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien think he can do better than a century of psychiatry, but he also imposes a silly leftist ideology on us; With the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss, who wants to take the weakness out of his girl. Distressing. But it's very nice to laugh at Zep (people with mental retardation are not funny, except in this movie).
