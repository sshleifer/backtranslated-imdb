This movie starts as if it were a comedy. It almost seems that the actors are reading the reference cards, especially in the airport sequence. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe", a hunter, who is quite twisted and deranged. Smith seems to always play with villains like "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "The Frisco Kid" (1979), to name a few, although in this movie the role of villain seems ridiculous. This is one of those movies where meaningless things happen just to fill screen time, like the girls chase sequence at the beginning and the long motorcycle race. I give this movie 1/10. I would have liked to see this movie in "Mystery Science Theater", it would have been very funny.
