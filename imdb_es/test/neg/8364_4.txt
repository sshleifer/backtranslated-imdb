Last night I saw an early preview of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything Christina Ricci does, at first I was very excited, but as the movie went on, I began to wonder where I was going. Based on a true story, it's simply about the character of Christina Ricci and her fight against depression, drugs, friends and family, as you can probably see in the title. In my opinion, this movie moved too fast, and it was too dramatic. I would say that there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie moved through his life extremely fast, and this did not leave room for us to connect with the character of Christina Ricci. The performance of Christina Ricci was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the entire film, and I think the success of this film will be all thanks to her and Christina Ricci. I would rate this 4 out of 10 and I would suggest that you rent this one or read Elizabeth Wurtzel books that are good and definitely worth checking out.
