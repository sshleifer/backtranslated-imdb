We all have to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his craft before producing good films. In fact, the film was dated before it was even published on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war in Europe ended for almost two months, of course, nor could Harry Cohn control the history events . So I wonder why even then the public did not question why a network of Nazi spies was helping the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the theater of the Pacific or Asia. The cape and the dagger were the territory of the OSS in that part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you're an FBI man like William Wright, it's good to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is about to go on a mission in the East to deliver the names of key clandestine leaders to start a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. The Germans who have been bothering the house of Otto Kruger find out about this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. Who, by the way, they refer to as 'Japanese'. When Foch is hit sideways by a speeding car and becomes unconscious, she dreams of Wright's danger and sees what's going to happen to her on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and frustrates the plot. <br /> <br /> All the things you would expect from a good noir movie, the hazy atmosphere of San Francisco, the low-light stages, Budd Boetticher did his best as did the cast. But they just were not convincing, probably because they did not believe this trap. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but it is not probable that the dream of Nina Foch and its psychic consequences have been more developed and that the developments have been left on the floor of the court room. I think it was just a really bad script. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures had the rapid events of history that go against them here.
