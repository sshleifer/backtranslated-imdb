I have not discovered what the chosen title has to do with the movie. This is another meeting of monsters like the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. It is not exactly a masterful plot, but Universal needed to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is very ambitious or exaggerated in the ego department. He is working on the cure to prevent Larry Talbot from becoming the werewolf. Somehow, Count Dracula goes to look for his vampirism. And to round out the good doctor's experiments is the restoration of Frankenstein's monster energy. On the way, the blood of the kind heart is stained with that of Dracula. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. as usual is the touching werewolf. Glenn Strange is the monster of Frankenstein, who has very little to make this exit. Also with roles mentioned are Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
