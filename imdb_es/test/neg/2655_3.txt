Being a Harrison Ford fan, I'm probably being nice. It was predictable, foolish ... my husband made many nausea sounds while we were watching him. What a disappointing movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave this 4 star 4 stars !!! It is hard to believe that the critic has seen the same movie as us.
