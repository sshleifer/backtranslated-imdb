I like underground movies when they have something to say, or show, for that matter. I tried hard to like "Garbage." I tried to see some artistic achievement, or some interesting representation of the life of New York City in the early 70's. Or at least be entertained by it? But the movie stinks and can not be called art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to expose the naked body of Joe Dallesandro for 2 hours, while he encounters other annoying and uninteresting figures. Okay, it's a beautiful body, but there's no excuse for a full movie about it, right?). Holly Woodlawn, as Joe's girlfriend, gives some good laughs at the end, but then it's too late to save those few hours lost. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrait of those people and that time, even if it's more fascinating than it really was. 1.5 / 10.
