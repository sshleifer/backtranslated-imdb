This is a bad movie, since its central message is very confusing and the plot seems that it was the result of the fusion of several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes no sense and is certainly not a film that Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud to make. However, the movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of the "Pre-Code" movies because it presents an amazingly sordid plot that says strongly that good girls DO NOT publish, even if they are not married and even if their partner IS! ! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker who assists the troops heading to Europe for the First World War. In the process, she encounters a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who finally convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he passes to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want it back, since she realizes that it is not worth it, but then her baby dies at birth. While all these highly controversial elements of the plot are used, they are always alluded to, almost as if they wanted the adults in the audience to know, but they expected that if they expressed it or filmed it in the right way, the children of the audience will be clueless (after all, the films were not rated and children could attend any movie at this time). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, all this plot involving a baby born dead and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and never mentioned or alluded again. It was as if they were filming part of a movie and leaving it, adding it to another movie. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne begins to work unexpectedly in a prison for women (although in reality we can never see her doing anything there). What we do see are innumerable horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to provoke. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a famous reformer and writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of nowhere, another kind of film emerges and the business of prison reform for women is on the way. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but desperately wants her. Throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl, even though she had a single sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived). But now, only Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady, starts sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are separated and married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with her safety, flies her clothes and they are in the baby's business. BUT, while pregnant with his loving son, he is accused of being a crooked judge. He assures her that he is innocent, but he is condemned and surely sounds like a scoundrel: he uses internal information of people who have arrived before his bank to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to free him and swears to wait with the child until Huston is released. The movie then ends. <br /> <br /> So, basically we have three separate movies and a strange idea in the early 30s about how a good girl should be. I realized that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships. This really undoes all the positive aspects of Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine someone who likes the movie. A strong advocate for women's rights could easily be offended by her mental weakness and need, and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspicious! With a decent rewrite, this could have been a good movie or at least interesting as a lascivious and salacious movie, but he could not decide what he wanted to be and it was just another boring Pre-Code movie.
