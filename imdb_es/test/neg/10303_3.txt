On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first seasonal album of the Loop. It is a typical television comedy with all the clich√©s that the genre employs with the "intrepid" intriguing brother (Sully), "Ditzy". blonde (Lizzy), unrequited symbolic interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian assistant (Darcy, who reminded me of Arliss, as if NO ONE had to remind ESA of that). The plot is about the bad luck (usually Sully) that befalls Sam who puts his work in danger on the plane, only to save the day, with "hilarious hijinks" in the middle. I did not describe a certain episode. I described them ALL to a T. That's where the problem lies, since what seems like a passable entertainment at first simply becomes useless when watching episodes in a row and increasingly boring to believe in endless repetition. Sully will do something 'crazy', Mimi Rogers will say something openly sexual, Russ will tell about his gay son, Darcy will make his personification of Sandra Oh about Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of a hint of annoying laughter. But do not let that fool you so you think it's good. Go see a much better comedy. Development arrested, always sunny in Phillidelphia, two names to two from the head. Surprised that this is still in the air. Oh that's right, Fox just canceled the good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust my friend's taste in shows. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
