I think there's a reason why this movie was never so close to the cinemas. It was probably my neighbors on the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. The acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something that you would want to see unless you were extremely bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, without "professionalism" at all. If the director (s) and / or the actors decided to continue their effort to make films, I would definitely recommend that they reinforce their skills and maybe take some (ok, many) classes on how to make films and act.
