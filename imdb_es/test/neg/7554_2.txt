The production values ​​in this video are so poor that you can not see them. The performance took second place to the overwhelmingly creative problems of the studio wanks, with around thirty special effects per minute. It was filmed through a cloud of smoke, of only one or two seconds duration per shot and, frequently, the spotlights shine directly in the camera. The lighting was terrible to film. There is a constant approach and distance with a total lack of visual continuity. There may have been a good dance available for the live audience, but those who see it will never know.
