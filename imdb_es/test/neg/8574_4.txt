The main flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker is inside your script. During the first half hour it is a good effort, create something of suspense and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even got some nice murders too! Then it descends completely and becomes a complete catalog of "its basic clich√©s". I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised much more. The last thirty minutes consist of some murders and many careers in an abandoned convent. It should have been much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room are pretty good)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the dialogue. It's horrible most of the time (there were a few giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it) and it was just fitting in other places. It is also barely audible during many scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (though, that might not be so bad after all, considering the stupid lines we have to listen to!). There is a line in the whole movie that makes reference to the films "I know what you did last summer", which indicates that the filmmakers wrote everything as a great joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me, it was mainly a matter of the first, because the final turn comes from nothing! If the audience had been given some clues about the girls' mental state, they might have thought otherwise. It also throws all the logic out the window, because the killer could never have been in the place for some of the murders! But as an avid fan of horror, I have learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But not everything is wrong. The film has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes of past times really shine here), a compact edition and an atmospheric soundtrack. Although most of the actors are quite bad, Anita Briem is an exception, which makes the most of what she has to work. Real presence on the screen! <br /> <br /> And, as I mentioned before, the murders are bloody enough for fans of those things and are generally accompanied by very good special effects that involve water images (but the "water theme" tends to get tired at the end, however). <br /> <br /> So, to finish this review, it's a movie that's pretty funny in a way "so bad, it's good" and also pleasing to the eye. But do not wait too long, since it's not fulfilled as probably he thinks he will, judging by the descriptions of the trailers and the plots.
