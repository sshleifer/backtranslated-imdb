Obviously I am disappointed, so I will be brief and I will not waste your time. First of all, the plot had no inspiration ... at least. The animation was even worse, we are in 2008 for the love of God and it seemed a brighter version of G.I.Joe. I will not even bother to characterize the performance of the actors and the dialogues. Or maybe I will because I just saw that to post a comment here you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Oh yes, the performance, well, it was totally flat, lacking in passion and talent if you excuse me. Now, in terms of dialogues, like acting, there are no memorable appointments, nothing that anyone would expect. Hopefully the movie is decent ... at least.
