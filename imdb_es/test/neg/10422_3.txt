It is reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have the good sense to shoot this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. <br /> <br /> These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; however, when trying to pass this hodgepodge of erotic and 60s chic attempts as * in any way * related to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, they were exposed as frauds. Either (A) did not bother reading Poe's stories, or (B) read them, but they were so fascinated by their own selfish agenda that they did not pay attention to Poe. <br /> <br /> Imagine If Metallica plugged in their guitars, it activated the amplifiers to 11 and took out 3 chords that they said was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. That's the feeling you'll get after watching this movie. If you are a fan of Vadim / Malle / Fellini (Metallica), you will dig it. If you are a fan of Beethoven (Poe), you will vomit. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a strange porn version of Poe. Well, "porn" may be a bit extreme haha, but at least you have to call it a version of Barbarella (including, I do not doubt, some of Jane's costumes that come directly from the set of that science fiction game). Vadim falls into old clich√©s of his own: the girl who is lying in a bed feels pleased by some man while from the pillow chamber we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and boredom of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Nice things, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for that. And in addition to Barbarella's costumes and irrelevant erotic themes, Jane Fonda's horrible American accent and her unconvincing performance as a European Countess made this the worst casting since Julia Roberts in that dreadful version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM Wilson ... <br /> <br /> Here is a great story of Poe about the madness that claims a man when he realizes he is no longer the only one in the world . If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go to episode # 27 of Star Trek "The Alternative Factor". But here, Malle focuses on that central theme and, instead, focuses on ... any conjecture ...? Yes, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. The role of Brigitte Bardot is a complete fabrication to achieve that end, and once again the director distorts a classic story of Poe in a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual problems. Do it in your own time, Malle. I thought we were here on Poe's dime. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The worst of the three and possibly the worst movie I've seen since "Staying Viva". At least Fellini showed some tact when changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, the theme and the humor of the story is so vast, I wonder if he has just released this scroll from his private collection of home movies, with the stamp "Edgar Allen. Poe story" about him and I sent him to this collection. I tried hard to find some thread of familiarity with Poe's works, but there was absolutely none. <br /> <br /> The original story of Poe ("Never bet the devil with your head") is a short and funny dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims: "I'll bet the devil on my head ..." a cloudy morning, the devil accepts his offer. The result is the sickest and dumbest thing you've ever read. It was Poe, the comedian, at its best (yes, Poe wrote many comedies.) You can also watch "A Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry" if you want to know his witty satirical works). <br /> <br /> This version of Fellini? It's tasteless, soulless, and nothing funny (unless you find it funny to see a drunk stumbling with him for 45 minutes). Here, the selfish rant of Fellini is about an artist who fights against the hypocrisy, pretension and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it is set in an awards ceremony where Fellini surpasses us with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic attitude of "sour grapes" that we find in all Fellini's films dealing with cinema. Consider the sarcastic punches in "critics," a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini spent a lot of time talking about them. In any case, I feel that Fellini simply took some 8 1/2 shots, put them together and sold them as a Poe story. The worst "adaptation" of the story. <br /> <br /> I think I put more effort into writing this review than any of the three directors in making a Poe movie.
