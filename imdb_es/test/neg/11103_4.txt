I saw this movie just because Sophie Marceau. However, his acting skills are not enough to save this movie. Almost all the actors do not play their character well, except for Sophie and Frederic. The plot could lead to a better movie if the correct pieces were in the right places. I saw several good French films but I do not like this one.
