Out of boredom and great curiosity, I decided to watch this show today because my four-year-old niece loves it. I should have known it was a show that only a four-year-old could like. The show was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the show was not fun. The hint of laughter soared at the most inappropriate times, which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes was funny. The hint of laughter shot up at some point when the only child who was the cameraman said, "I'm going to polish my lens." How the hell is that funny? The parts (like the meat drum) that were supposed to be fun were stupid for anyone over the age of eleven. <br /> <br /> Now, I have the feeling that four-year-olds are not the target audience. However, since I have a four-year-old niece who looks at her, this kind of thing bothered me as I watched her: she does not show very good behavior. In the episode he was watching, he shows Sam stealing Carly's sandwich and pushing it to the ground, just so Carly can get up and do the same to her. I would not like to see my niece acting rudely. I also do not like the idea of ​​two girls having a web program in which they divulge personal information ... If this were real, there would be monsters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This program will probably be good and fun for someone who is eleven years old or younger, but whoever is older than that, just stay away from him. I will give these two stars because I think I can see how it can be fun for a child.
