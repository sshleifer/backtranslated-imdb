Hey I see this movie in class because someone recorded it and brought it. He expected a half-hearted attempt to portray the myths of Heracles, and since the advertisements seemed serious, he expected something quite decent. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the movie, I realized that it was CRAP. The only things in the film that are almost faithful to the myth are the minimum (and I mean the nude). The parents, half brother and labors seemed to be named correctly. Apart from that, the rest of the movie seemed to be a giant inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say that this was not much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was made for young children, therefore it was not very serious. This film, with all the sex, violence and nudity, was clearly intended for a larger audience, but the story presented in this era was almost inaccurate like the Disney movie.
