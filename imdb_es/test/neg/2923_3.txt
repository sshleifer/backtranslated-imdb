A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone that, unlike his recent epic "J.F.K.", fails to stimulate any real emotion. "Talk Radio" is about the presenter "Barry Champlain", a very noisy and opinionated man who manages to annoy a lot of people and still attract an audience, most of whom care that you just want to call and abuse of the. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying that he is just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. And when Barry (Eric Bogosian) receives the death threat over the death threat, the end result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. However, "Talk Radio" does not make a serious comment and remains a frustrating and pointless movie. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
