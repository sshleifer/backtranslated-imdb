For me, Bollywood movies in general are not much, although they are still quite desirable and Bollywood is a great file creator, as they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only reason the movie made me see was to see to what extent an American actress could change or affect the logic on which the Indian film is based. Not only did the story of the film not change, but this combination provoked a series of ridiculous events. <br /> <br /> I mean it's quite common to see lots of illogical things in Indian films, since they have their own world in their movies. But once you see that such incidents happen to an American, you make yourself laugh. For God's sake, can you believe that a famous American actress is trapped in a desperate situation and feels powerless? Can you imagine that an American actress fell in love with a dance instructor whose girlfriend already fell in love with American's boyfriend and they met at the same time? There were many similar things to mention. The less said, the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong, since I expected too much from Indian Movies.
