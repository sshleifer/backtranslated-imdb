This movie is not even good enough for the $ 1 container in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> I only bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. I guess I could not be too demanding with your roles during this time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was hard to see. It seemed they were holding straws with a story. The "boys of the night" had to be the most boring I've seen. In one minute they are talking and the next recite poetry? Even the arguments were difficult to follow. Most of the actors lacked depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were doing in this case, but they certainly failed.
