Actually I was waiting for this movie. After reading several reviews before the release, it sounded like a really pretty movie, one that was very well filmed and another with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt). <br /> <br /> Well, it could have been all those things, BUT it's so boring that I challenge almost everyone to feel fully and keep the attention. Also, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is shamefully bad. He's such a good actor that I cringed every time he talked in this movie. <br /> <br /> 'Disappointing' seems to be the word most used by reviewers to describe this film, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I think it did not take long for Word to explain how bad was this movie because, like Cage's accent, it did not go well.
