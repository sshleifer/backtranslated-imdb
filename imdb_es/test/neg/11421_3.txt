There was not much thought about history on many fronts. This is a good action movie, but that's it. <br /> <br /> - The movie says that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. However, they are kept in cages and have necks on their necks. So they can not become their wolf form or do anything that no other slave can do. How does this protect vampires during the day? Whose are they protecting vampires? The uncontrollable lycans? Slaves in human form are no more than peasants. <br /> <br /> - My understanding is that vampires are immortal and do not age. However, Sonya ages from child to adult. Did they just stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was converted (as explained in the second film). But the vampire babies old? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I did not realize that vampires needed torches to see in the night. However, we see them carrying torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing that supposedly could harm Lycan. However, the wooden fillets fired from the huge crossbows also kill the lycans. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that show the lack of thought in the telling of the story.
