The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was not able to cope with the excellent book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer instead of helping them understand what was happening. The director obviously had no experience, and if he is, then he did not show it. In addition to that, the scenes of the book were omitted or modified, scenes that were quite important. The movie left me quite bored and it was a complete waste of time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. In general, the film was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that, otherwise, was necessary to make it even remotely interesting.
