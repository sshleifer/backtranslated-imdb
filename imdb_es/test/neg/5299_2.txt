"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up"): people were finally understanding Elmore Leonard, making good movies with his work. Then, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, I could not resist renting it. I thought: How bad can it be? Hey, what a mistake, especially right after reading the book, which was unconvincing (and also circularly self-referential) in relation to the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. Still, the book was better than the movie. Leonard again triumphs over the weak and unqualified screen writers who try to take over his book. The written dialogue for Steven Tyler was painful to watch. And the lyrics of the first song of the character Linda Moon? My high school students write in more depth. Sad sad Sad. Why even give it a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to watch on the screen, and Andre 3000 was not fooled completely.
