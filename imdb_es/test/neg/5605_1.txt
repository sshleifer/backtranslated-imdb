I looked at him out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and I've seen many of the other TV shows and movies the main characters have worked on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so tremendously disappointed. <br /> <br /> The acting in everything is atrocious, and the script is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research on the bad science that is released throughout the film, or on martial arts (in which several cast members participate throughout the film, although clearly not there is training in martial arts (baton baton is not a warrior make)) the training makes the plot already implausible is even less credible The same weapon (carried by Michael Shanks), when shooting on the side of a mountain, causes a Extreme damage, but when shooting inside the wicker wall, creates a small firework effect without damaging the wicker structure. Okay, I guess Michael Shanks fans will be sued to see that in Stargate SG1, where a staff weapon creates a burn on the surface of a main character, or makes a hole in a section of the castle wall as needed ), but still ... A bad serpent CGI 'god' eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat - snakes just do not behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an Amazon warrior cult on a distant planet is, in the best of cases, silly. Matrix societies have always been based on the lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species; for example, the Picts, who did not discover the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century, at which time, the balance of power moved from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science, especially medicine, so the idea that there could be a matriarchal society with this level of scientific knowledge is based solely on the wet dream of the original author. Of course, the few references to stellar science made in this film show that the author did not know anything about it either (except for a few key words he should have heard in other films). Still, it could have been done better, such as 'She' in 1965, for example, which showed the matriarchal society with a certain reverence, much more credible, and even after 45 years seems fresher than this fetid exercise of stupidity. Marching a few women in "armor", pouting aggressively and spitting their lines like a child looking for a fight in a nightclub ("Come on, then, I'll do it!") It seems to be oversimplifying The complexities of a matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> Cultural references are very simple: "everyone cheers the snake mother" pretty much sums it up. Even the smallest village shows a greater cultural variation. <br /> <br /> There's nothing intelligent, stimulating, interesting, visually exciting or entertaining at a distance about this movie. The soundtrack is of a similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few positive, overly charitable reviews that this film has received come from Michael Shanks fans, who will give their approval to anything he is involved with. Do not be fooled Low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail, cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there's no reason to inflict this movie on you.
