When this series aired, I saw most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long-running series in the line of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk", where the protagonist is being pursued all over the country in search of a solution to their problems. In this case the problem of the hero is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good, especially the painful relationship between the main character and his wife. The problem is: they canceled it before it had the chance to end. (Either that or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They never had the opportunity to wrap the story either, knowing that it had been canceled. Poof has just left. However, as I said before, I could have missed the last episodes. But my proof of the opposite is the following: I rented the tape. Where I left it in the series. The main character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving King's famous organization, the Store. While escaping the hero is kidnapped. It ends when your friends realize they have to go and save you from the store. The end. Last episode. In the video: His wife does not die but escapes from the fire with him. Just when he should be trapped by the store, he and his wife share a strange moment and then disappear from existence. Brusco, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video and decided to label an ending no matter how bad it was. They could also show some images of the first detonations of the atomic bomb. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a great sequence of opening titles with David Bowie's song of the same name
