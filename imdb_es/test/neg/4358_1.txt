I really hope that the creators of these "movies" read these reviews so they know that people just do not want their movies. They are just garbage and a shame for the killer clown horror genre. Whether this was better or not, the first does not matter because both are simply terrible. I'm surprised they have not learned the lesson of the first movie. Stop now !! Warn the spectators of horror movies, DO NOT LOOK, RENT OR LOOK AT THE BOXES OF THE "URBAN" HORROR MOVIES, AND ESPECIALLY, DO NOT BUY THEM!
