For some reason, I did not like anything and I felt embarrassed by how bad it was since I bought it and I saw it with my family. We all hate him with a passion. It's a pretty nice children's movie, maybe in the year it came out. However, think about it: an outdated children's movie? What is the point? In general, children do not like watching such old movies, and I do not see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies for children (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits is totally outdated. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I did not like Dr. Strangelove or Spinal Tap either. So, if you do not agree with me on those equally old-fashioned movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a horrible case of overacting, as a reminder of the 'bad guys'. Think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in the Pirates of the C movies, except for Time Bandits that are not even remotely funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned you that that is all I can do. People who rate this film as high must have liked it for many years. If you have not seen it before, then do not bother seeing it now.
