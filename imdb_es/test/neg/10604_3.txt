This is a surprisingly bad action movie. I would say that its main defect is that it is boring. Arghh! The funky cabinets, the retro chic set design and the decent cinematography can not prevent this movie from being a snoozer. The second (main) defect of Mod Squad is its lack of character development, underscored by the lack of talent of the actors. I like the work of Claire Danes, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is regrettably bad: how is it possible that his clumsy, cotton-mouth acting style could fit into an ACTION movie? As for Omar Epps, well, he needs to take some acting lessons to learn how to broadcast. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save a few dollars and wait to see this turkey on the wire.
