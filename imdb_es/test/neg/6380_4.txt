This show has shown that the colors are true now that the Democrats are in power. He never led the world in IQ, since anyone who thought he had intelligence has been programmed to think in a way (which is something that is scary). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central did this and it goes back to an earlier version. once the Democrats took power for a reason, because now when the Democrats make a mistake, which is as frequent as the Republicans do, Stewart no longer shoots them. That's why the qualifications for this and the turnaround are coming down. <br /> <br /> Basically, most of the humor is now unconvincing, or lame Sarah Chain, that all the ratings that the comedians are discounting. The facts to support this speak for themselves. The Jay Leno show that has been doing the same humor is about to be canceled. The ratings of Letterman & Conan and the programs that follow them go down. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that if any of them begins to take real breaks with the Democrats in power, they could increase their ratings quickly because the best humor is always at the expense of who is in power. The Bush years showed that because the qualifications for this program & Colbert, and Letterman & Leno were higher there. <br /> <br /> O'Bama has done one thing, has shown that these programs must be willing to take risks and tear themselves. The people in power if they want to prosper. Right now, the Daily Show and Stewart are sinking, but maybe they'll get lucky and make Palin be chosen as the first female president in 2012. Then, Palin's bad jokes will become a winner of ratings.
