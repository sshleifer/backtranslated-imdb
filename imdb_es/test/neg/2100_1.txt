Snakes on a Train is a movie that I rented due to the pure fun of the thoughts I had about the film. Snakes on a Plane was a nice action movie, so, obviously, the filmmakers wanted to take advantage of the success, with this effort of low budget. At 85 minutes, Snakes on a train is almost unbearable to witness. I had to keep pausing the movie to do something to entertain me, due to the lack of events in the movie. Throughout the duration of the film, it is never fully explained why this girl has this curse, or why she keeps crying this green / purplish goo constantly. Not only that, there is an endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Warlock and Soul discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate low budget movies. I'm not really demanding with the movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is truly one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the writers in acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most importantly, how the hell could the train devour? <br /> <br /> In a few words. Snakes on a Train is a film that should be avoided at all costs. Do not be intrigued as I was by the title, this is a movie that is really bad. Let's put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
