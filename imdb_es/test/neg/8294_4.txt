Okay, a movie about a movie that takes a drink in the making of films on video could be entertaining. It could be, it should be, funny, nervous, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the negative version of Bizzaro. Hamlin was entertained as a film producer 'B'. Shatner went crazy but nice, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, bored and bored. The production value was low. In fact, you will see that the boom has been reduced in one scene. The sound was horrible in some of the scenes. Hello, now I am a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin, but here their talents are wasted. At least the story had a clich√© ending.
