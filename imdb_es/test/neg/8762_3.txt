There is not much to say about this, except that it is probably the worst in the early series of zombie movies (I can see another, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the end of the month). Despite the intention of all, John Carradine, to build an army at the service of the Third Reich with them, you can not see them doing anything at all! James Baskett (Uncle Remus of the SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) Interprets his leader, who also serves as a servant of Carradine. The black comic Mantan Moreland resumes his role as chauffeur of "fraidy cat" of KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic Madame Sul-Te-Wan as Carradine's housekeeper. Unfortunately for Carradine, his supreme achievement? The zombification of his wife? it brings him all sorts of problems: not only do his relatives go to his remote residence / laboratory to investigate his sudden death (which means he has to fake a funeral service!) but, in reality, he is disobedient and outraged, and finally "persuade". Your fellow zombies will rise up against your master !! Also involved is cowboy star Bob Steele (best known for his part in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [1946]) who plays a secret agent in the United States posing as a Nazi posing as a Sheriff ! Fortunately, director Sekely would have much better luck with his next genre effort, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFICULES (1962).
