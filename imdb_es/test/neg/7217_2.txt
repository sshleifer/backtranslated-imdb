If I had never seen the first Road House, I guess this movie could have one more star, but even so that makes it a 3 star movie. Actually, I was surprised by the relatively high rating that you currently have. <br /> <br /> Actually, I could not finish this movie, since it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it is quite similar to the original, even though the original plot is still referenced. This really does not make sense and it does not work. Also, the acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I was watching people act. Even good actors like Busey do not work, probably because of the script or the uncomfortable editing. The strangest thing is that the movie looks like a movie from the mid-90s, but it's made in 06. I'm not sure why, but, once again, this usually happens with the sequels for some reason. The music, the appearance and the general feeling remind me of the movies you saw 10 years ago at Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing of all is that I also hope that Ja Rule arrives at some point ... it often reminds me of the most current movies with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most irritating is the love interest The girl whose character seems a total scam of the character of Lois Lane in Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And let's not forget the louder "southern accents" that I've heard since Walk the Line. I realize that this is a commonplace in movies, but no accent would work better than trying to sound like you were from that universal place on television where anyone from the southern state (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same. Of course, people in the desert cities of Arizona sound just like people in the southeastern states more than 2,000 kilometers away. That was running out 10 years ago in the B movies where the technique came from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I really would not recommend it if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. Also, if you have not seen it yet, do not spoil it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those accidental classics that people love and see over and over again. It was an unexpected hit like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (just the first one!), And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it? "??? <br /> <br /> They should never have done a Road House sequel that was not a high budget version with the right actors / directors. Of course, you can never beat the original (for example, Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it well, it will be presentable as is the case with the examples I mentioned. But doing a Low Budget Road House self-production outside the network is criminal.
