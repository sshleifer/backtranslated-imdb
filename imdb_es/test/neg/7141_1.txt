Well, first the good: if you saw the trailer, then you know 100% of the "scary / restless" moment of the movie. And yes, it's a good thing because you have to follow the trailer and not go see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive in that movie for a long time, she did. I do not want to associate your name with this production. I wish you the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow 3 different stories in this movie, and all are disconnected (in time and meaning) until the end. And even then it is a very bad climax. And God does not even allow opening the door to another sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "The Rage and Fury" is in motion. It is no longer necessary to visit the house, just stay close to someone who is inside and ready. It's no longer a curse, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, you get scared, go back to the USA. UU And spread the joy in the building of your apartment. <br /> <br /> It's not that hard to follow, but you really do not care about anyone. The plot line is very thin and you have many scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head. I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia film festival last summer, a completely different story, but much better than this. It's not a new version, but this time, maybe they should have just made a new version ... <br /> <br /> If you have to watch it, wait for the DVD.
