In my opinion, this movie is not good. I just find something good to say about it, but I'd still like to explain it, before concluding that it's just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch it because Costas Mandylor is starring in the movie. And that was the main reason why I saw it until the end. I like action movies, and I understand that such films are based on action rather than history. I know they do not go into detail when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events, but even that does not explain why some scenes, simply because they lack the sense of reality, seem ridiculous. <br /> /> At first, the film seems quite promising: a strong and good-looking specialist, and his partner not so strong, but intelligent and fun, must do a job, which is a bit different than what they expected. The story takes place on a cruise. A disaster happens, the ship turns around and only a few remain alive. During their struggle to survive, they have to escape from a shark, a professional murderer and the water that rises. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie is quite violent. The main weapon (besides the disaster that has already taken most of the passengers) is the weapon, which is used successfully in many cases. Personally I missed a good man to man (or woman to woman if you prefer) fight. Family fun? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie was shot hastily, without a real vision of what it is trying to say. Made from the tricks of usual action movies, with a little something called love, and without a real meaning, it only translates into a bad movie.
