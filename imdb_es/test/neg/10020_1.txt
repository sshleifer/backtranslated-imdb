Of course, most of the films of the 1980s were not worth the celluloid in which they were filmed, but this video nightmare may well be the most boring produced . <Br /> <br /> Six students who smoke in a hot pot decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know, they start being killed one by one by a mysterious stranger <br /> <br />. The climax has an astute ranger trying to reach the teenagers in time before the last cute little girl becomes a vulture. <br /> <br /> bait. <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie boy, made the terrible makeup effects here <br /> <br />. The cast features Carel Struycken, from "The <br /> <br /> Witches of Eastwick" and the Addams family movies. Unfortunately, he does not appear until the end of the movie, and is covered in makeup and becomes unrecognizable. Steve Bond (does anyone remember him?) He's here in a first role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's address and the script he wrote, both smell like the <br /> <br /> Presents brown bears that go to the forest. He fills the film with <br /> <br /> so much of the desert's archival footage, I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the plaster <br /> <br /> sits around the campfire and eats, then walks, and sits and eats <br /> <br /> again. The ranger is involved in the strangest scene that has been put <br /> <br /> in a slasher movie: tell a joke about a wide-mouth frog to a deer <br /> <br />. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that she once worked <br /> <br /> with the silent film legends, has two scenes, and is involved in <br /> <br /> in the second weirdest scene ever staged movie: him and <br /> <br /> the hunky ranger has a conversation about cucumber and <br /> <br /> cream cheese sandwiches in oatmeal ... yes. <br /> <br /> There's not a minute of suspense here. The killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> survivor looking for a partner, observes the students from behind <br /> <br /> trees. We know it's the killer because the filmmakers have <br /> <br /> turned on a beat sound effect that helps wake up the viewer every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine sap and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween", instead. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, light violence with a firearm, gore, <br /> <br /> Some blasphemy, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual references <br> /> <br /> and drug abuse.
