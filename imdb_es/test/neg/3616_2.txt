I really do not think it's necessary to write a review about a film with such an ironic title as "Snake Island", but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, this reached a new low, so my anger should be known. . The only reason I even bothered to watch this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad, it was very late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy. To me and make me sleep. It soon became very fast that this movie was going to be horrible, but it condescended even below those expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the film as a tourist guide on the African river, who ends up having to leave his team on a remote island called the Snake Island. that another ship descends to pick them up. They get together, get drunk and then submit to the attack of poisonous snakes that are on a mission to purge their island of human beings. , do not bother to reread it, you got it right the first time. Frankly, I prefer the characteristics of my creature when the creature (s) simply attack foolish humans with no sense of hunger, not because they have some kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda". They are simply ordinary African snakes, like mambas and vipers, they just have the brains to form armies, take causes, work together to catch people, understand our language and even dance! Did your drawing fall again? Well, it will fall further. Halfway through this horrible film B, about the part I had already given up, the human characters begin to drink around a bonfire and, suddenly, they become a kind of orgy. And while they dance naked and so on, the snakes hunt them suddenly, stop and start to get stuck. The combination of this scene and the scene in which we discovered that snakes, some of the most mischievous creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against human beings for some strange reason, turned out to be too much for my poor brain. And just when I thought the filmmakers could not take it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie? Well, let's say I've never disillusioned the creatures before to kill everyone so fast. I just could not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really do not think I should move on; you get the picture. If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from its other rivals, it is that it dares to try to be even more foolish and that is not a complementary achievement. Why? Just because? I'm still holding on to these really bad movies, I guess I'll never know. But "Snake Island" reaches its lowest point. It's a cheap and shoddy excuse for a movie that makes "Anaconda," a brainless snake movie, look as bright, sophisticated and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws." You have been warned.
