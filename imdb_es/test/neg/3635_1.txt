This television program is stereotyped and exaggerated in many aspects. <br /> <br /> First, the environment. All the characters attend PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted and elegant bedrooms. The campus seems to have no reasonable rules, for example, children are often seen in girls' dormitories and vice versa. But this may simply be due to the bedroom advisor, a silly character who basically bores the viewer instead of entertaining him, since I assume that his purpose is supposed to be, sit down and do nothing. I have friends in a boarding school, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next, the characters. I was very disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon was not creative at all with the personalities of this show. All represent a characteristic that is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is the athlete, Logan is the arrogant imbecile who basically does not do anything. In addition to aggravating all the characters, as well as us poor viewers, Nicole is the very tasteful idiot who knows nothing, but somehow maintains A's ratings, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the " Intelligent girl "unrealistic, who constantly tease. Chase is the guy who is afraid to confess his "true feelings", which really aggravates me as the show continues, and that new girl, Lola or something, is just another Nicole clone. <br /> <br /> The two main The characters that make me worse are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand the character of Zoey. Obviously, it was created to be the "perfect" character as I said before, but it seems to be the most flawed of all. In most episodes, she creates a problem and then has to fix it. What's frustrating is that we're supposed to love her and think she's amazing when, to begin with, they have not even created a very realistic character. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point where her character is absolutely insulting. The impression that I have of Nick with respect to his character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh, criticize, mock. In the spring break episode they did a year ago, they presented two more 'nerds' that the characters had to do 'cool'. I found it highly offensive and stereotyped. What kind of message is Nick sending to these children? It is: do not do well in school, do not get good grades, do not study much, you will end up being a geek and we will make fun of your profession in future television series. Because that is definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters, and it's a horrible message through one and the other. <br /> <br /> All I can do is wait for Nick to one day realize that by putting smart people aside. In our world, they are not doing any good to anyone.
