This series does not present the British vision of the War of Independence, but an anti-American vision of it. The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of settlers enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were intriguing manipulators whose sole purpose was to bring Great Britain to a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist and violent insults, duped into the struggle. Clearly, the intention of the author, Richard Holmes, is that the spectator extrapolate these characteristics, in a straight line, from the American population from 1775 to the present. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The Shot heard around the world" Holmes draws a dark impression of the Boston Massacre, in which he claims that the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the The first man killed in the revolution was deliberately "eliminated". Holmes claims that portraying Attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows this. And there is more. Holmes strives to work on a single unfounded atrocity: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. Compare the US military with the Viet Cong and the mujahadeen, without mentioning any difference in the objectives of these groups. The list continues. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, this series was made in response to "The Patriot" by Mel Gibson. It says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any subject. Instead of presenting the British point of view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensationalist and anti-American point of view, and, in the process, became the Roger Corman of historians, strictly stupid.
