Were the cast and crew drugged before they started filming this? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled it. From the first scene in which the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt about where he was and what he had done? The suspense had ended from there. Now, it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was resolved. I must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how foolish the scriptwriter, the director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea might be to explain at least how our killer, who was not a lawyer. Or could a policeman go to a closed cell in a prison, kill his second victim and tie him on a rope to make it look like suicide? I wondered if I had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and had lost track of how it had happened. If someone can explain it to me, please, do it ... and then, why, for the love of God, did you kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet, someone thought that this film was worthy of being an official selection at a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I could not laugh.
