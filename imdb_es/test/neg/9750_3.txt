I just watched this movie. I liked the soundtrack. I first saw the trailer and it was great, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the movie is almost horrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then ... like almost all new movies, fly it. I do not have the idea, why did that child die? It's a cliché, every nigga movie 'must have a child to be killed, and everyone must be good after his death. LOL. I do not understand what the connection with the film is ... And it's so predictable, you know the ending from the first minutes. Nothing new in this movie. I saw the same idea of ​​'They served you' but also ... something new ... this is something like 'Honey', but there is not a small difference between them. If you have no other option, watch this movie, but make sure it's the last option you take. And the choreography is worse than everything before. This is NOT a must to make sure ...
