Coltrane and Idle are members of a gang of bank robberies that cross their leader during a robbery. They hide in a convent school and disguise themselves adequately to avoid being detected by the mafia and the police. There is a lot of catholic humor and slaps, but the script is a bit thin as is the laughs. However, there is a GOOD shower scene ... on a scale of one to ten.
