If you want a great April Fool joke, please show this movie to someone. However, it is important that you do not criticize the film in any way, but that you talk about what is an artistic triumph and that "they just do not make great movies like this anymore". While the victim observes many disconnected and pointless scenes (such as a cute dog that is not punished for no apparent reason, a cow standing in bed, a woman licking the feet of a statue or Jesus seemingly raping a woman), make many comments using words like "brilliance", "juxtaposed" or "transcendent": act as if the movie really made a lot of sense and was not a complete waste of an hour of your life. Also make sure you keep your face serious and pretend to be upset when (and if) they say they did not understand it or that they thought you had all the art of a cow pie. Then, to continue playing with them, show them all the comments in IMDb, since almost everyone (except some creators of problems like almagz and rooprect) speaks brilliantly about what genius and art this movie is! When you are done with this little farce, you will most likely think they are idiots and make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the ONLY possible reason to see this horrible disaster of a movie. That, or you can show it to the Guantanamo prisoners so they can talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous box of dogs that play poker or a velvet box by Elvis is artistically superior.
