Look, this movie is terrible ... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left to the care of a succession of babysitters and babysitters, whom the children distance because they are completely obnoxious. Eventually, the ex-cons child engineer Beverly D'Angelo will be your new nanny, do you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV show about the sale of children and decides that he will try to sell the twins ... and, well, you do not want to know. Everything is very unpleasant and not funny at all. In fact, the announcer programmed this movie before it appeared on the television channel I was watching! Just do not bother losing a single moment of your life in this whole rubbish heap, right?
