Clearly, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear Jess Franco's crown while coveting (at least cinematically) the wife of the old warhorse, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt prison steed, salacious and masturbating in this modern and ambitious W.I.P. movie. With some exceptions, many of Franco's films are produced and directed ineptly in a hurry. Shots do not always come together and sound mixes can be horrible. While watching "The Angel of Death 2" (also known as "Massacre on the Island of the Prison"), I wondered if Bethmann is deliberately trying to replicate Franco's bad reputation, or is he, naturally, so wrong as your mentor? Is this film deliberately bad, that it would be counterproductive, or is it just bad for negligence? After a hitchhiker is forced to give a blowjob, her rapist fills her mouth and then fills her vagina with some drugs. Minutes later, she is taken to a prison on a cliff for unexplained reasons and subjected to ridicule and mismanagement of staff and other inmates. As this is a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes in abundance and many violent behaviors. The blood is bloody and sadistic, too, with delights such as tooth extraction and scraping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty horrible and the fight scenes are boring, but there is a love for sleaze in every painting and an understanding of what garbage fans enjoy. Unfortunately, the flat script does for a flat movie. Then, despite the numerous atrocities, the hard sex and the appearance of Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But is not that what most of Jess Franco's films are?
