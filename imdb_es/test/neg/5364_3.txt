I am a fan of the paranormal and I love ghost hunters, so when this program came out, I decided to try it. I could barely sit through an episode. The show is so obviously on stage. I mean, come on, every episode involves someone who is being possessed or a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another big flaw is that these guys never discredit anything. When I see the ghost hunters, they find evidence and try to refute it, and if they can not, then it is evidence. In this program they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. This completely ruins their credibility unlike TAPS and ghost hunters who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in the paranormal and want to see a program about it, look at Ghost Hunters.
