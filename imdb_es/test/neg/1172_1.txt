The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and terrifying story. Ed was really a messy character and his legacy continued to inspire "greats" like The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired a melodramatic piece so boring with nonsense? Ed Gein made nipple belts, bowls of skulls, leather lamps, danced under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this came into the film because they needed to tell us a fictional story of a ridiculously horrible deputy and his pretty homely and sex-hungry girlfriend. This movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify the story. What baffles me is that most films deviate from the path of truth to exaggerate history; This one seems to do it to minimize it. I just do not understand.
