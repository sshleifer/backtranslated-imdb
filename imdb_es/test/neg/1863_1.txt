Ghoulies IV starts at a museum storage facility where the blonde dressed in PVC and leather Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for an old jewel. After several guards, she summoned the demon Faust, whom she adores and with whom she wants to have sex. so he is not happy and orders him to get the last remaining ... that belongs to Jonathan Graves (who returned from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who has experience in demonic possession and things like that after the events of the original Ghoulies Alexandra is dedicated to finding the jewel to be able to bring Faust to Earth permanently from the "other side" to, well, I do not really know. Erm, that's all really ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski, whose name carries chills when attached to a movie that I'm about to lose 90 minutes of my life in Goulies IV is as expected full , total and absolute shit from start to finish and it's as simple and direct as that. The, ahem, 'script', cough, by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies movie, except in its title and they managed to convince Liapis to replay his role, which also has the additional advantage that it is capable of using the material of the original although it has no relevance whatsoever. The story almost does not exist, the whole movie is a real task to watch, it's incredibly boring and stupid, it's slow, it's predictable, it's absolutely clean in terms of blood or blood and it has two comic relief goblins that I guess are supposed to be that they must fill the Ghoulies quota although they do not look anything like the previous films and, in fact, they are embarrassing to watch, in fact, I think they were practicing to be ventriloquists for most of the movie, like when they talk about their mouth. Move ... You know I do not want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore, please believe me when I tell you that this is a big piece of garbage of proportions the size of an Elephant, do not waste your time or your money. <br /> <br /> Dirctor Wynorski turns into a totally rotten movie on almost every level, the special effects are terrible as is the whole movie. Apparently, Ghoulies IV is meant to be a kind of horror comedy, but you lose both goals by the proverbial mile and it's neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this movie is the actress Randall with her PVC and leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel and that's not worth sitting through this garbage to see. There is a scene of a fleeting half decent car with some accidents, but it seems that it was edited from a completely different movie and given Wynorski's track record, I'm sure it was like that. Forget about any gore since there is not. <br /> <br /> Technically, the IV Ghoulies suck, it's obvious that I had a low budget, but that's just not an excuse for it to be so bad, right? Liapis is back in the cast, though he probably would like to have walked away, the baby girl dressed in PVC, Randall, is easily the best thing in this movie that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is crap, there's nothing more to say. Seriously, I can not see anyone enjoying the movies getting something from this, I simply can not. I can not believe I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies about anything, but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap, it's much better than the Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people and you can thank me. then. The things for which I feel so that you do not have to do it, honestly ...
