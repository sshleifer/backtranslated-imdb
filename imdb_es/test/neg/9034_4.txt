Marked for Death (1990) devotes more time to action sequences than focusing on their characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third painting by Steven Seagal clarifies the idea: anyone who opposes him must appear foolish; The bad guys are just there to make it look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal had been building an audience that seemed a little bigger than those who follow the antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude. Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for the death, Seagal leaves aside any pretension of style and goes to the maximum to the operation. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seems to be there for no other reason than to please noisy viewers, who are unable to distinguish between action images that tell a story and those that simply shed emotion without rhyme or reason . . And he deserves a real blame for this lapse in his taste as a producer of "Marked for Death." <br /> <br /> Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who returns to Chicago, where his family is being attacked. By a street gang in Jamaica, who attacked her sister's house, and the film shows that it is not delicate when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris) is shot in the crossfire. Hatcher gets angry and decides to team up with his old friend, Max (Keith David), a teacher of school gymnastics, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Hatcher declares war on the boss of the wicked, a tormented Jamaican voodoo priest called Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "exaggerated outrage." <br /> <br /> And it's almost incredible in the way Seagal chooses several gang members: tears a boy's eyeball, breaks a boy's back and breaks numerous arms and limbs. <br /> <All the logic of this movie is thrown out the window, that is, through the glass. Why is not Hatcher and his friends accused of all the property damage they cause or the body that accumulates? And how did they get their stash of automatic weapons from Illinois to Jamaica by plane undetected? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him that the fans seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he has played in so many movies, each dressed in black oriental bathrobes, and wearing a horse tail. One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's films is that the main characters never seem to be in serious danger, and since he is the star, of course, nobody can put a glove on him, except the bad one. br /> <br /> The heroes of Seagal are all interchangeable, as are most of the lines of the plot and the action sequences. Regardless of whether he is disguised as a boat cook, fireman or police officer of L.A. who carries pearls of love, Seagal is always Seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. In fact, the similarity of these films is such that, if I wanted, I could take an old review, change the names and have a reasonably accurate vision of the new movie. Not that I would ever really do that ...
