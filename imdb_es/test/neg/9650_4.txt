This movie is a shame, especially if we consider that Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur director but a professional one. However, this movie does not offer anything you can hope for. <br /> <br /> First of all, I am Polish, so I can tell the whole background story, because I read books. But how can you say that there is a war in this movie? A lot of people come and go, some soldiers shout ... Is this really World War II or are the soldiers on vacation? <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogues - poor, miserably poor. A.Å»mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra fit into their roles, the rest of the cast (Polish) is out of place (especially M.Ostaszewska, one of the main characters, what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are only placed there, the actors had difficulties to act and it is not surprising considering the strange things they had to say. <br /> <br /> And this brings us to the most disappointing. problem - you can not feel it Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling in it. There is a lot of original images of World War II and, guess what, the material is much more powerful and dramatic, than what A.Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I can only see a positive aspect, despite historical mistakes. (like the acronym ZSRR, it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please the Poles that ZSRS had disappeared, and now there was ZSRR, but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!), fortunately, it is certainly shown that they killed Katyn Soviets (yes, it's a fact, not a controversial gossip). Great, two hours for a 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway: time and potential wasted. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, willingness to fight in 1939 (hardly shown), without declaring war on the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (sic! Not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers shortly after, living conditions scandalous (not shown here), hope and fear of what will come next (hardly shown), and then ... extermination. Hand in hand with the Germans: the Soviets were exterminating the Polish nation, aimed at the people who formed the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they are successful, and the results are still visible to this day.
