I do not think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However, I can offer a small memory of not having seen ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, as the camera withdraws from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits begin to roll at any second, the audience seemed to increase in unison. Normally, for a movie like this, at least - some - fans stay to see every last disclaimer. While the people were leaving, I do not remember having heard laughter and happy jokes, just low murmurs. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a review of a movie in the local newspaper in which the critic said it was so bad that only Trek fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the most apt to destroy it first! <br /> <br /> The worst of the favorite scenes: shooting the target on a Voyager space probe, through a periscope, no less! The space must be a border much smaller than we thought.
