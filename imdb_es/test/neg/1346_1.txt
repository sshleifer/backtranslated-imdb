This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the department "this movie is so bad that it's funny". Rather, it is simply bad. Other reviewers mention poor lighting, but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor script and an uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It's hard to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It seems that only a group of women together, pretending to be close. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to list all the problems with this movie, since it does not deserve anyone's attention. (Nor is it worth the time it takes to see it).
