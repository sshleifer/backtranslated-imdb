I know that these kinds of movies sell tickets and make profits for filmmakers, but they do not serve as a film about Vietnam. Viet Nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day after day. <br /> <br /> This film stars Gene Hackman, a veteran of the Korean War assigned to train a group of veterans from Vietnam for a trip back to Vietnam to rescue a group of prisoners of war. Americans in a camp there. These men include an old tunnel rat, a crazy sailor who throws acid, a blond surfer from California and an inexperienced child (Patrick Swayze) who, by chance, had a father killed in Nam. First they train in a camp in Texas and once in Nam they are discovered and lose all their weapons. They can find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men. Most men are found and saved, but the rag-tag group is almost eliminated. <br /> <br /> This movie was played as a video game in which you could discover what would happen next and who would come to light. Behind what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. Viet Nam, I guess it was not like a video game ...
