I was a little old for this show, I was 6 years old when it first came out. First of all, when I was little, there were some shows for children that were in Sesame Street, of which I did see and I learned, but apart from that there was not much else. My cousins ​​were born a few years after 7 years was the first to arrive. Barney was a big part of what they saw. The first time I saw this program, I told my grandmother that she does not teach anything, she just uses magic to fix everything. I was 9 years old at that time, how many 9 years have some idea of ​​what is really happening with a television program. More and more I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were more and more I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is that my parents had a small child from the mid to late 80s, which incidentally was me. They agreed and said the same as me. The sad thing about this is that my cousins, over 13 years old, still agree with what they saw. It is not deceptive, it is creative, it is not right to think differently to what someone tells you. It is good to steal if the person does not discover it or care that it is gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney wants to earn money and not teach anything to children. The more striking the program, the more inclined the children will be to see it. The children are not stupid because they have no education, they just do not know anything better, second Barney organized a program and his parents bought it. I never thought that television could affect people like Barney does. If you have a young child who reads a program that teaches you numbers, do not allow them to get involved in this program. Barney is like smoking once is too much, smokes a few and his hooked allows his son to see this program and then one day his children will see the same shit and buy the same shit he bought
