The novel WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage, is one of the best techno-thrillers to lose the pike in a long time. The character of SOLO, which is not supposed to look like a human, is a wonderful creation and it was simply horrible to see it reduced to another clone of Terminator with Mario Van Peebles, trying horribly to "act" like a robot. There is NOTHING worthwhile in this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on obtaining the rights to excellent novels and then assassinate them? There are so many things wrong with ONLY that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man without legs to an energetic Hopscotch game. Avoid this horrible movie and look for the 2 ROBERT MASON novels that present the incredible character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel to SOLO. But do not pay attention to this horrible movie.
