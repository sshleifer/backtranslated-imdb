Face! Antoine Monot, in a mimic imitation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking, but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert simply can not say no to a joke, no matter how cheap it is. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, a sober old-school bard of "There's Something About Mary's Fame," would adorn any history of dropping out in a small town. In visual appeal, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks good enough as riding his six-door BMW of just six series, wearing aviator glasses, going nowhere. It is true that he * accidentally * sleeps with his bohemian wild-eyed sister (Marie Zielcke), but then, who does not? I also thank you for turning black and white with a liberal dose of that mysterious substance called zero to zero, but if you are looking for a more serious representation of what intoxication can cause, I suggest you check "Fear and disgust in Las Vegas".
