I saw "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was in it, after enjoying it in the series "Poirot". And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went into the film with the expectation that it would be a potentially valuable movie. Unfortunately, it was not like that. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to criticize the performances, the rhythm, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. The only thing that I want to address is the message of the film, since it proclaims in the introduction that it is based on a real story, and in that hangs the supposed importance of the film. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Journey" focuses mainly on a poor African black named Kingsley who wants to move to the United States, because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less, his motivation is completely selfish. (Of course, some people will get angry saying that he was doing it for his family, but he actually decided to have children with the income he could get in Ghana, so he really created his own problem). For that, Kingsley decides to keep on board a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, members of the racist crew and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But here is precisely where the movie leaves me without compassion. Why should the audience be expected to worry about Kingsley? Simply because it has a goal? Goals are not such a rare product that their privilege must be privileged, for example, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman left at home with their newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the government of the United States. It is also illegal because it robs the Russian shipping company. If it arrives in the USA UU., That would imply eliminating a system that has not been implemented. And if caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I doubt very much that any of the stowaways worry about what it costs to others their chosen course of action; They are clearly out for their own benefit. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for his legal passage to the United States, and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead, take the illegal (and dangerous) route. <br /> <br /> So, since Kingsley's trip is illegal, selfish and can not be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his experience? Simply because it faces challenges? Why should their challenges be privileged over the challenge of the Russian shipping company to reach New York without stowaways? Why is it black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the executive producer of the film) and others involved want us to support Kingsley, as if he were a hero in a kind of noble journey. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and the mission of a fool are not noble, you can not worry about him. <br /> <br /> Before anyone plays the race card, I assure you I would. I felt the same no matter the ethnicity / nationality of the parties involved. Imagine if a British person decided to keep a train in the direction of Bhutan, cross the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiquities to bring to Britain and sell them. How much sympathy could the challenges you faced create? Very little, I would bet. So, why should we feel different for Kingley? Why is it black? Why is it poor by American standards? Filmmakers are confident that we share their views that ends justify the means, and that a shipping company that receives a fine of $ 45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility that an unskilled worker will earn a little more in the United States of what could have done if he had stayed in his own country of origin. I did not buy it for a minute.
