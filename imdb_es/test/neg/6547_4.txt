It was the first action movie banned in the action style of the USSR in Hollywood. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of that era. The plot is childish, the direction is regular. This movie was successful because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Although I saw it many times, I must admit that it was something naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of a Russian action movie. This is just the first experience.
