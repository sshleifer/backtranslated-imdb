This is one of the most original and full of cliches I've seen in my life. Even if you did not like the background of this movie, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks', it is likely that they have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they say: "Do not bother with us, we are all losers", you can see everything that is looming thirty kilometers away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the courageous teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be extremely evil children (they are snotty, yes, but not so attractive), a small town sheriff, slow wit, who love to torment, an arrogant head coach of The winning team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher shows some probability. I never really got interested in Steve Guttenberg before and his acting as a sheriff does not change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. Hopefully, writer and director Holly Goldberg Sloan will come up with something better the next time she leaves.
