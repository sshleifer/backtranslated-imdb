Really! Here, French cinema reaches the bottom, and in comparison to it, the least attractive of American teen horror films, such as "Friday the three", "Freddy" and his colleagues are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <br /> It is even more exasperating as there were original exciting elements: the Forêt de Brocéliande and its legends, the druids and King Arthur, all were splendid assets for a fantasy and horror movie as in a dream. Alas! Filmed, as a user aptly pointed out in a fake forest, near Paris, the film is a false horror, a false Celtic story, false traces. I should see the teacher (Wilms, who was a wonderful M. Le Quesnoy in "La vie est un Tranquilidad larga") shout for the "priceless scrap" that the production probably bought in a ten-cent store: fake characters, fake excavations. .. <br /> <br /> Children disguised as druids are, unwittingly, very funny, girls who seem to be martial arts experts, and what can we say about the teachers? About the monster? A boy of ten. years I would write a better script than this grotesque farce, thinking that people can spend money on such nonsense when artists are still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a wonderful story about druids and ancient ceremonies in his saga Arsene Lupine called "L'île aux trente cercueils." A miniseries was made 30 years ago, avoid this rubbish "Broceliande" and try to see it in its place.
