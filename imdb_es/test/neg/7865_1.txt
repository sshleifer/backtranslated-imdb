* The ELITE sniper team that has inserted 24 hours before, instead of digging and becoming invisible, decided to cover behind a large rock in one of the first scenes. * When the hero "runs" to rescue his wife, he actually runs. * When he is inside a building and aims at a target only about 20-30 meters away, the hero USES HIS REACH. Besides the fact that most non-elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and keep hitting there, there's also the fact that the range probably could not focus that close. * There is a satellite that can really look horizontally in buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of trash I've put on my DVD player.
