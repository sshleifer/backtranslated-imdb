I just watched this movie on opening night. I read some comments from other users that convinced me to go see it ... I must say that it did not impress me. I am so impressed that I feel the need to write this comment to save some of you some money. <br /> <br /> First of all, "Los Mensajeros" is very predictable, and it's not a great thriller. I could scare someone under 13, but he really did not do anything for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience withdrew before the resolution of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance seemed a bit superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the scenes of suspense below the average. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the progress of this movie, then you have seen most of the best parts and have a great understanding of the plot. It is not worth watching this movie in theaters.
