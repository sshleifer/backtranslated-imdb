Well, what can you say about a "horror comedy" that presents neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but there are too many plots, all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> Computer-generated creatures look bad, a bit like the Disney versions of large, tailless rats. The undead are the biggest scam apart from the title, they will look like the dead in the Landis movie, but they are far apart. They only look like bad actors with some plastic and bull blood added. <br /> <br /> Two story lines really showed some promise (the love story and the history of the "company"), but they failed so miserably as the director, the writers, the SFX department, the production and actors.
