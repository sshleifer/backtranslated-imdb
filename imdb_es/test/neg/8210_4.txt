"Dungeon of Harrow" had many things that could have made this a good horror movie. Creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. But unfortunately it is not very good to say that a writer and a captain shipwrecked an island owned by an earl in a castle, his slave and a mute maid. The count becomes increasingly suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and lean more towards them and subject them, and the mute maid who befriends them, tortures and imprisons them. Does not sound bad, right? <br /> <br /> Well, not at all. I used to call this one of the worst movies I've seen, but now I hesitate. Because it had so much potential, it can not really be called "one of the worst". However, seeing all this wasted potential is a great success against this movie. In general, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and confronts the crazy and leprous rottenness of the bride, adorned with a shred. wedding dress. This was spooky and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene. I wish this was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the right things to make this a grumpy night cooler, but in the end it took all the wrong turns. I suggest that someone redo this.
