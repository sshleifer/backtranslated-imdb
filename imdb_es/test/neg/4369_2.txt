I've never seen Killjoy's first movie, and I've never heard anything good about that either. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters, pick it up and look back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon boasts. Now that I'm the big Troma fan that I am, there's no way I'm not going to rent this movie, how can it be bad with these two in it? Oh, how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can not stop this excuse of a movie from being as bad as it really is. Frankly, Trent stinks like Killjoy, although this is probably the fault of writers who give him some of the worst comments in film history. Debbie does a good job but it's not enough. The deaths are terrible as are the effects of blood. For example, look when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or another. And to top it off, the end is among the worst I've seen in the history of cinema. The movie does not even work at such a bad level that it's good. Avoid like the applause. <br /> <br /> 2/10
