When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought: "Eh?" It was so confusing. To be sure, I went to see the movie and what do you know? It is a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been changed to adapt to the whole essence of Indianness, but the rest is a direct impulse of the 1998 Hollywood success. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this one is so poor that it hurts to see it. I moaned so much when I saw this and realized that I was not the only one who did it. A boy left the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop playing comedy roles. Scream and moan too much. Why can not you just take it easy? He does not do justice to the role originally played by Adam Sandler. It does not have the comic sense of Sandler. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but neither is Drew Barrymore. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not coincide with Barrymore's version ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed to see that scene, even though I loved the original. The music is not so bad. It's probably the only saving grace of this horrible movie! Avoid this at all costs!
