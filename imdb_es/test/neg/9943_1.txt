I've seen hundreds of kung fu movies and I've heard something good about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst movie exhibitions I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that the director wants to have all the muscle guys in Hong Kong in this movie. Everyone overacts to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the barbarian had some civility. This movie only has half-evolved men who scream in every scene and stupid women who do not have self-esteem. The character of the narrator should have been killed for sucking so much ... she really did not deserve to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic disaster, with horrible acting, bad direction and bad action. They should just change the name of this movie to 'The Stupid One-Armed Caveman with a Blade' Here's a question ... why does a director use fast cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the deficiencies of the actors All the scenes were up close and they were cut quickly without any flow The film tried to show itself intensely, but it became almost laughable ... Get away from this movie, you have all kinds of likes in kung fu movies .. or any taste in movies.
