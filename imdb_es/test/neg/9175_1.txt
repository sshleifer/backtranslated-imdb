What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), let's see ... a package store owner says' it's darkening outside 'to what it says' makes it better' 'night vision' '. What the hell does that mean? In fact, what the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes in which you could drive the killer's van. Not to mention a policeman on duty, Robert Forster strolled asleep through this strange attempt to take advantage of the madness of the serial killer, and a murderer who recorded his murders. That is all I remember. <br /> <br /> The movie took place in Texas, it had some car chases and a final clich√©. Maybe if you watch this movie with your eyes closed, could it be good? After all, without being able to see it ... it would improve ... the night vision. That makes sense? No And neither is this movie.
