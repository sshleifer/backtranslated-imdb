How does this movie stink? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work in The Sopranos, I learned this in Blockbuster based on his name and a story that seemed to sound promising. He still does it, but this movie does not fulfill it. <br /> <br /> Each turn of the story is completely predictable; I kept looking for the Lifetime error in the lower right corner of the screen. Everything is there: the noble woman who comes out of difficult times, the man who is not up to his potential despite his best efforts, the child who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. The identity of the mysterious stranger is what really made me want to throw things on television. I would have felt more satisfied with the little Stuey when I woke up and realized that everything was a dream. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers could also have had a "The moral is history ..." shortly before the credits, since, as another critic pointed out, this thing really works as a special program for after the school. Do not play, do not drink, do not use drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... come on, how about a little nuance? How about some interesting bad guys? Writer / director A.W. It should be highlighted to Vidmer for a special notice: not only is the main dialogue, the rhythm (within the dialogue and at each end of many scenes) makes this film at least 45 minutes longer than it should be (and believe me) , it feels like more). The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the support cast (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a "1" rating. All his good work is almost compensated, however, by the atrocious work of portraying the child Stuey. I'm not sure if it was a casting error (hey, it's a mafia movie, so let's choose someone from Blue's Clues who can not do anything but exaggerate with a big fake smile ... then let's go to throw the somber and melancholic child in the Disney movie) or just a horrible direction, but those scenes are really painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in the opinion of another filmmaker about this character and his story; It's a pity that Imperioli has already been exhausted by this movie. Horrible, horrible, horrible
