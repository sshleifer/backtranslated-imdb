* SPOILERS! * When I previewed this for the first time, it looked like a good old fashion movie. I love bluegrass music, so I could not wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. The movie was pretty boring for the first half, every once in a while a song was played. Then (I'm ashamed to write this) came a lesbian love. I think there was something more than friendship between the teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity and prolonged sessions. I was seeing this with my mother and I was quite embarrassed, because I chose this movie. But besides that, it was a good movie. The acting was good, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I do not mind watching the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after I saw the movie. And there are continuation discs that follow. If I were you, I would skip the movie and only get the music.
