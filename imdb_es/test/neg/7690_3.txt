The amount of exaggerations and the great success that this film has had is proof of how desperate our people are towards a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the enormous success of "Tash ma Tash" is also evidence. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start with how important it is to make movies, since it's obvious to those with half a brain how the movies I changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I will not say how much our society needs a lot of movies to clarify many of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many more. <br /> <br /> Throughout the news about the first Saudi film that should have been a remedy for some of the problems we have. , especially towards youth. Instead, we experienced a bald movie. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. It was as if a 13-year-old child had written it. <br /> <br /> Now I've heard that the budget for this movie was huge. I'd like to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the editing was poor. The script was "kharabeet". You really do not know what the story is and what the director of this film wants. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good but with bad direction. Another thing with the role of religious friends that I had, is not how religious types act here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "evil" as this film claims. In fact, they are some of the nicest people with whom you will find a really uncommon way of life, and that is what should have appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> The young people are following the religious here because of one reason, and that is that young people are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles in which the religious live, the young follow them. Once again, this is what should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another "First film" with a writer, actor, director, composer and even a Saudi cameraman. So that everyone works with passion in their experiment, not only for the money! <br /> <br /> And we must do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we must include phrases from the Koran in the movie script. Since the people of our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge facing a Saudi filmmaker is to change the mentality in that angle.
