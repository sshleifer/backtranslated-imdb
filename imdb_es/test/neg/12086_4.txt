Despite the strong performances of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to awaken the imagination of the viewer. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Mrs. Driver? He had great potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> For me, this was almost like a Yentl version of the 1850s without musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver positions herself as a governess in a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> Although I realize that this is a period of peace, it was very boring even for 1850 England. and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The lady of the house is more irritating with that singer's voice of hers. I expected her to refer to Driver as dear at any time. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know Driver is trying to pass himself off as a Christian, but does this name mean all the way? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love with the accused young man's father (Wilkinson) and his emotional imbalance son. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see done is that Mary has found a profession for family photography. Did we really have to be subject to what was happening throughout the movie? <br /> <br /> The early scenes of Judaism practiced in nineteenth-century England and the cholera epidemic in the end could have been played more. There is a definite underlying feeling of anti-Semitism on the part of the Wilkinson family, but that is never allowed.
