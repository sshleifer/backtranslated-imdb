Well, to begin with, I must say that here, in Russia, a saga of Geralt de Rivia is known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski, a talented writer or, perhaps, even a genius of some kind, created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical fantasy worlds of God d @ mn in a history of literature. And when that amazing stuff gets right in the right hands, see the role play "Witcher" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Vedmak \ Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite result. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. Lack of direction Lack of a good script <br /> <br /> These three filthy movie whales. By sinking this movie, he ate it alive. Acting is good, sometimes even more than good, but for the love of God you can not save this project. <br /> <br /> Although I still have some faith. I still hope that one day Vedmak's new films will be created and that everyone will see the magnitude and splendor of Sapkowski's books. P.S. But before that you have to eliminate a Uwe Boll. Just in case, you know
