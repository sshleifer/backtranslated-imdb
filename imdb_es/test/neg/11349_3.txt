Any of Law & Order's, CSI (choose your city) and Homicide: the weakest episodes of life on the street is superior to the strongest episode of Bones. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is trapped in the horrible Angel mode, and Emily Deschanel plays "Bones" too ... unrealistically. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, either with a forced performance, or simply with horrible lines. <br /> <br /> The murders become predictable after a while, since the omen and the clues are too obvious. > <br /> The music is fine, although sometimes it is really unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general, Bones is not the program that I recommend to see during the weekdays, since it is a carbon copy of the best programs. with unreal characters and always boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
