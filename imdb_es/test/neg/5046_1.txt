This is just one of a hundred million movies in which directors try to put too much drama in a movie that is not dramatic at all. As in the beginning, the part where the monk type pushed the arrow into his own hand, then threw the same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later, without any sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the plot line is the CGI, which would be very rivaled by a homemade flash movie. The actors seem to be doing everything possible to represent a group of robots from the 70s; the dialogue makes so little sense that it's not fun. <br /> <br /> Many things HAPPEN without any explanation of how or why, like a lady who wanders through a zoo that had closed for hours. And when she sees this THING flying towards her, her first reaction is to take a picture, instead of what she did about ten minutes later, walk with the energy (not even running) as if her life depended on it, which, obviously, , It is not like this. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not recommended. It makes me wish they still made new episodes of MST3K.
