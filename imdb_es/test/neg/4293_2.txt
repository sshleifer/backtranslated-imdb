I saw this as a child, before it was ripped from the rotation, and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth. There were some gags elaborated competently, but making the villains of American citizens who had been interned in camps strictly because of their race was incredibly tasteless. <br /> <br /> Moe himself could have wanted it buried. He was a liberal boy. In his autobiography he said that he visited a city in the segregated south, where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid going too close. Moe went out to show that it was not a problem, and the man went back to the sidewalk. Then again. Finally, the man told Moe nervously that if Moe kept trying to share the sidewalk with him, he could have them lynch both of them. <br /> <br /> Another thing: there are ostrich eggs that explode but there are no oxen in the movie, so the title should be (if anyone cares) "The Yolk's on Me".
