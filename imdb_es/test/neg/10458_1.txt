A great cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had any of those things, it's possible that it was not among the worst movies I've wasted an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but along the way, this appeared in his bin and somehow became a movie. It can be said that the actors regret having signed those contracts with every word they murmur directly to the camera. The CGI is extremely amateurish and could have created more tension because the cast had been attacked with the Sinclair Spectrum in which it was created. I wanted to like this movie, it has nice appearances by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I expected a funny horror movie that did not take itself too seriously. Actually, try to take yourself seriously, but it's as fun as going to the dentist. Do yourself a favor Do not watch this movie, you will only encourage them to do more.
