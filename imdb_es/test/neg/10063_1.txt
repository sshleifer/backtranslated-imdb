Producers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to publicly release this garbage. I know this is going to sound clich√©, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is moronic, cheap, irredeemable, childish, false, inept and BAD ACTUATED. A milestone in bad movies, and one of the few, few films I've seen that REALLY deserve the lowest possible rating: no stars!
