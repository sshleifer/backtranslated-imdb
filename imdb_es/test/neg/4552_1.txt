Ok, let's start by saying that when a Dutch movie is bad, it's REALLY BAD. Rarely appears something with a little quality (Lek, Karakter) here in Holland, but not often. Coast! It's like 4 girls who go to Spain to go on vacation, go partying, get drunk, take a powder (you know the exercise). It is also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. The professionals who try to attract the crowd to your club. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but I suspect somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, because you're watching a lot of random scenes for 90 minutes in length. Nothing, and I mean that nothing is credible in this movie. It's almost too ridiculous for words what happens with the story. Suddenly, the film becomes a kind of karate action. With a face-to-face fight with 'the bad boy in black' and the car chase scenes through a water tank (may be more corny). Also the words "character development" and "casting" are not familiar to creators. <br /> <br /> After having seen "Traffic" 3 days before this, I fell from pure brilliance, from a work of art to this one. This is making movies at its saddest moment. And do not start with the low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the filmmakers were too busy feasting to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the chicks in the water eventually did it a bit, but for the rest, do not waste your money on such garbage.
