This is a horrible movie !! Some people told me that it was not really that bad, but I disagree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and fun), but I guess this is something we all know. Besides that, the dialogues are terrible and the writing is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this movie is the quality of being entertaining. Not always for good reasons, but it's a good movie "so bad that fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the movie called Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I had never heard of such a legend. Although it sure made me laugh ... :))
