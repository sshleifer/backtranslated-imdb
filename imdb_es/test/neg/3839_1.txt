A blind person could have filmed this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a newbie. It must be Dennis Hopper's cocaine dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. I felt so embarrassed by Dennis. <br /> <br /> To John, the director ... PLEASE withdraw from directing. Your contribution is not necessary or wanted. The middle of the movie is stronger without you. You are terrible directing. Stick to grocery bags or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie should have jumped "directly to the video" and gone "to the trash". I'm a silly person for watching this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU RESPECT AND RESPECT THE ART OF THE MOVIE!
