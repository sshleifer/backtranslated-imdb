I thought I could see something good, but ... I'm tired after seeing this movie, I do not know what I hated the most: the script, the acting, the effects or the music. Try to imagine the worst episode of the Power Rangers and still be kind. I have seen better effects in the FPS games (the touch with the bone sword or its breath that is making people disappear in a green smoke is a touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I liked how the women shouted in the car, when the "monster" walked around the car (even if she was looking the wrong way). So take a break and do not look at this, at least call someone to watch a horror movie with you, trust me, you'll end up playing the monopoly for some kicks.
