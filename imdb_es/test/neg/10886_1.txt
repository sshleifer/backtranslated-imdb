I can not say it's simpler, this is a terrible movie. I worked in the industry and made several (short) movies, so that's fine, my level is quite high, but seriously, I hate this movie. I have not commented on IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to come and warn others. It's a piece of sh * t. The writer / director is an idiot who simply has no idea how to make / write a good movie and has the writing skills of a teenage teenager. The characters are not realistic (the female leader does not think about taking the policeman's gun but has enough resources to improvise a Molotov cocktail? Please ...) and it is not even pleasant, he hated it and encouraged it when he died. I do not understand what the director was trying to do with his demon idea, but it only looked like sloppy writing and convenient nonsense without any real thoughts behind me. This is officially the worst movie I've seen ALL YEAR. Congratulations, Shiban, you are now on the big list as Micheal Bay in the prestigious club "you should not afford to lose millions of dollars in making a movie". I hope you've read this, I really do. And to the 163 idiots who rated this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHA ohh, my God, I hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you.
