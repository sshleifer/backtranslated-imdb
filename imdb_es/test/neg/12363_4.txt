I'm not going to tell the story of the movie like some people do. I'm pretty sure that people who read this will know what the story is. Nor will I continue and follow everything that is wrong with this film, because I will be here for a long time if I do it. The story is typical, and special effects are below current standards. This is not a movie you should see if you're a movie fan (like most of us) small things will bother you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you are a casual movie viewer, who likes to have a good time when watching a movie, then this movie is perfect for you, very funny. It would also be a good movie to have a partner. Just not for us movie fans. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
