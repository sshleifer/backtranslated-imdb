Target is the story of a special agent who, after fulfilling orders to assassinate Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those American films for men who love super nationalistic patriotic crap films without meaning), returns to his house to discover that His ex-wife and two children are being taken hostage. Charlie Snow only has a couple of hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst movies I've seen. And, if it had not been for someone I really know (and probably, by mistake) taking it out of the video store, to begin with, I would never have seen this giant garbage pile. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any other generic action movie I've seen before. In fact, these are the kind of things that they falsify in variety shows, which is how bad it is. I half expected Mad TV's Into the Color to Will Sasso's 'Homey the Clown' to make his impression of Steven Segal in the middle of the screen, to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie, but now our characters are here to spy on how ridiculous it really is. There were not even good fights or action sequences. From the way things develop, you would not even think that someone was kidnapped, that there were terrorists or that something remotely interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Not only the story is complete and absolute. Without interest, the performance is terribly wooden. Just look at the part where Stephen Baldwin, like former Special Agent Charlie Snow, is talking to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have his wife and they put her on the phone. She says "Charlie, help!" Or something like that. And Baldwin responds "Okay, darling" so inexpressively, you think he was reading the script and trying to pronounce the words phonetically. I imagine that, despite being a ridiculously bad movie (one that is in the last 100 in IMDb, a list that should expand to at least 250 films and should contain almost all the films of Stephen Baldwin), someone with some talent I could have At least made the effort not to ruin it so much. Someone. No one. He could not ignore the fact that everyone seemed to read a script. Except that, the only person in the entire friggin movie who has any kind of talent (and therefore should not have been in this), Deborah Wilson of Mad TV. <br /> <br /> This was the capital's cheese festival. That really embarrassing.
