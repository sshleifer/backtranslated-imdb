In the 1960s, those of us who were bad movie buffs thought that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made, and would continue to be so at all times. However, to put things in perspective, we also thought that $ 3,000 was a lot to pay for a new car. <br /> <br /> As we grew older, our innocence gradually decreased as we were exposed to films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank," which completely redefined the genre of " bad movie. " In this context, last night, my son and I saw "Alien From L.A.", which took the envelope to an unimaginable end only a generation ago. Calling this film "bad" (or unhappy or execrable) fails completely to do it justice, like any other label existing in the English language. Even if there were words with which to describe this film accurately, it would not matter, since they would be forbidden in civilized society. <br /> <br /> The Alien that is referenced in the title is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took some time off from modeling swimsuits for Sports Illustrated, to kick off her film career. Your casting might seem like a kind of recommendation, until you actually see the movie. The makeup artists earned their money making Kathy look so monotonous and unappetizing that you would not want to touch her with the end of a broomstick, which is not easy at all. To put it bluntly, in this film she has a face that would freeze Medusa. Even worse than his appearance, however, was his voice, which was so scandalous that at first I did not consider it as originated by a human being. Throughout the film, I found myself wanting a blackboard to drag my nails to cover the squeal of their dialogue. At the end of the movie, Kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if it had been put on the swimsuit at the beginning of the film, so at least we would have something to do with it. My son pointed out perceptively that if they had removed their swimsuit and put it in their mouths, the film would have improved considerably in two ways. I refer to the clarity of his observation. If you have any questions, compare this combination with "Barbarella", in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the assets of an ethically beautiful protagonist in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> Of the plot, in itself, there is not much to comment, since there was so little evidence. It is said that if a million monkeys typed incessantly for millions of years, one could eventually find "Hamlet". By the process of elimination, the rest of the time would arrive with something similar to this script. Imagine, if you wish, a modern Alicia that falls into a hole and falls 500 feet on a rock slab, after which she gets up, removes her dust and begins looking for her lost father in the city-kingdom of Atlantis Once at Atlantis, he spends most of his time running, fighting or climbing stairs and stairs, and basically trying to stay out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to carry out his orders, and who would make Tiny Tim look like a male. . This summary, as abbreviated as it seems, is probably longer than the film script. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, as you take delight in the production values ​​and capture what you can of the outfits and costumes through the smoke and haze, you realize that this is a movie in the one you can see on the screen where the $ 20 budget was allocated. <br /> <br /> The idea that kept going through my mind was that filmmakers should not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are filming a movie, or maybe before, if it leads to results like "Alien from LA" , although in justice I have to admit that I do not know if they were really involved in the substance abuse, or they were simply brain dead at the beginning of the project.
