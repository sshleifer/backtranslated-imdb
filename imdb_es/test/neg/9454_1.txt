How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and I can hardly remember what it was ... <br /> <br /> I also paid Â£ 1 for this on DVD, the old story of 'put-a-new Syndrome "cover-in-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it". All I really remember is that the cast ran a lot, the use of the cars must have been way over budget and that a vampire was involved. On the other hand, I suppose you can tell by the title of the movie. <br /> <br /> Direct to the video trash or directly to the cheap DVD as it is now. These things will be in the containers of offers in rental stores, supermarkets and charity shops until the sun's death. Only cockroaches will rule the earth, but this garbage will continue to exist. God bless the dawn of the DVD era ....
