This was really horrible. Looking with fascinated horror, I kept asking "why have they done this?" That is to say, it eliminated all the scenarios of "The day after tomorrow", "The perfect storm" and "Twister" and we remixed them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by Dick Lowry, the TV director for a long time. clich√© known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubled for Chicago, so, no doubt, the tax deductions had something to do with that. Although some ambitious special effects were attempted, the execution is so poor that no decent spectacle is achieved. The actors can be a competent lot; the script is so bad that nobody had the chance to show it, except perhaps for Randy Quaid as Tommy, the tornado chaser, who was very funny and was quite funny. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, since then, the producers made another of these Canadian disaster turkeys called "Category 7, the end of the world", which was shown with pleasure on CBS in the United States a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In prime time? PT Barnum "nobody broke down underestimating public taste" is demonstrated once again.
