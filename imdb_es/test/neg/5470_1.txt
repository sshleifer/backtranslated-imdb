Low-budget garbage about bloodthirsty cultists in Greece headed by Peter Cushing. It is up to the priest Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this shit in 1978, and was "the dog of the week" in one of the episodes of Sneak Previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forget which of the two "pursued" him, but I see the point. Crappy's movie has the worst performances of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance I've seen. There is a monster in the video box. There is no such beast in the movie. Instead, you get a statue, but at least it's atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultists look like the Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group could exist. Skip it.
