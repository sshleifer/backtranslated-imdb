My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this selection as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "If I was tied to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I could not imagine that hell would be worse." Jim Varney plays a three-handed player The madman insisted on destroying the world (apparently starting with the cinema) Now let's be honest, nobody expects much from a Varney movie, but this feeling of agony left me dry for 92 minutes It was not a laugh, not one. This is not a problem or a problem, it's not even absurd It's bad Do not rent this, you can destroy your DVD player Do not even buy the VHS from a 29-cent container to use as a blank tape It's the worst movie of all times, period, I mean it, really.
