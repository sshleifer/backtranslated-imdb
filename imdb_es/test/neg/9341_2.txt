I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that I witnessed first hand the prime ministers of the best DCOM. I was there when Brink! They appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc., these films constitute my childhood. When these movies were released, not only me, but whoever was watching them would be completely amazed for 1 hour and a half, talk about it during the next week and see it again next weekend. I do not think words can express the amount of emotion that Zoog Disney brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I see them now, the dialogue does not seem so bad (in fact, it is so effective that I really remember parts of conversations literally word by word, from movies I saw more than ten years ago). The characters are believable, fun, but a bit stereotyped, but that's what makes the Disney charm ... <br /> <br /> I sat my little brother in front of the Disney channel to try to convey it and make him understand my feelings. for DCOMs. He gets stuck in the suburbs ... my brother looked at me somewhat puzzled, wondering if he had always been gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now, with what could I compare it? When Han Solo discovered that Lando sold it to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half of the movie, and I'm not exaggerating, is flashbacks. There is no talent in these young actors (some of whom are older than me) at all. The plot is ridiculous; It feels like a bunch of rotten old corporate employees at Disney, sitting around a table and asking themselves "How can we look modern to these young people?" Well, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but at least they made a little effort not to make us realize that we thought we were complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently this kind of movie works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is rated almost as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is this possible? Did DCOMs become even more corny and people prefer them now? (although apparently the lack of curses is enough to give 10/10 to some people) Christ, is a completely different generation.
