To start this movie was sick. Here your wife is dying and you are walking through the city with this blond chic at your side. Then his wife dies and within 2 months they are together with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout this movie. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it, she is having sex with her best friends. The part that catches me is when she "does it" in the barn with Kevin and is caught by another of Hanks' friends. Kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and BAM !! Directly in the arms of this other boy and begin to "do" at that moment. I guess he's finishing what Kevin started. THAT NASTY!!!! I'm like this is a movie for life ??? It's a typical OLD MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body if I receive your money ...
