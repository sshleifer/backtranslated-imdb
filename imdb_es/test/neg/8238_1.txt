I picked up this movie and was horrified to discover that the movie is based on the rape of a girl that parents knowingly bring their daughter to. The first thing I thought was that I had never been ashamed of being Indian or Indian. I thought that this movie was pretty horrible. Please do not waste your time. As for music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the movie used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what characterizes India. I just hope I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes, it can highlight how evil people can be in power, especially when it comes to religion, but sitting and watching almost 2 hours of this movie can make anyone choke. If you're ready for a good Indian movie, look at something from director Mira Nair.
