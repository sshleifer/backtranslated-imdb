The horrible production does not qualify as a "movie". Obviously, it was filmed on a videotape, and very bad at that! There is a constant crying sound for the audio (it sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that sometimes you can not understand what the characters are saying. Badly folded music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire edition of this theme has a value of ZERO! <br /> <br /> The plot is ideal and ridiculous. A gay man of the late twenties who tried to hide his living lovers from visiting parents? PLEASE! And the reaction that the mother has when she finds an image of her son kissing her boyfriend is more than melodramatic and becomes stupid. Talk about a stereotyped vision of gay life! The acting is worse than a porn movie, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As far as "production" is concerned, there is none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a small attempt recorded on video to be called "film". There is no heart or soul to praise him. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! BAD ACTING! BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is vanity, since this garbage probably cost them the price of the videotape in which they were recorded. <br /> <br /> This most important garbage does not have to be released on a DVD because it is misleading to the cunsomer. I can not emphasize how horrible this "SUGARPLUM" crap is! <br /> <br />
