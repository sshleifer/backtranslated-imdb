Here is the. A new icon of terror for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More badly than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But your time is here ... <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, the antagonist, Ray is a complete Prick. This is partly due to the bad things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, fear) on his face. But mainly because Ray The Prick has been milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray does not channel evil. He does not even get cursed, not even for a voodoo spell. No, Ray the prick has been milked. As DeNiro once said, "you can milk anything with your nipples." And Ray has been milked. Of evil. <br /> <br /> How do you milk the evil you ask? Snake nipples, I respond. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why does Ray ask? Because it's a puncture, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Beware of the extravagance of New Line Pictures entitled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick." <br /> <br /> Did you think your new savior of horror was Jeeper The Creeper? Well, no more, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Pity for the environment without environment, PG-13, however, the non-original quality of the film, because Ray is a star.
