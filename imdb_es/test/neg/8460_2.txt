If this was nominated for a screen writing award by the WGA, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang the word processor. Astonishingly inept writing, direction, production, on all levels, even for a television movie. No clich√© remains untapped in this bad movie. What were you thinking? Does anyone really believe that children are stupid enough to see this?
