As the title suggests, there is a philosophical and meritocratic thread throughout this film: if a man has the talent and seeks to find his way in society and money, what could be the result if he is denied for not having the X Factor? This question was not addressed satisfactorily in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me a bit cold on the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the title Ripley and, apart from making his way on a Europe-funded excursion He falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoerotism and social insecurity are entangled in a violent conflagration that intensified and complicated for the rest of the film. Law, Damon and the damn nice Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are fine. I liked the article by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Freddie Miles, the friend of the bluff society that Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is lumpen without arc (or redemption, really) which makes it quite difficult to swallow. 4/10
