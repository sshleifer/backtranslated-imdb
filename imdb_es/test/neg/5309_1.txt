I rarely give grades of less than 5, but in this case I must weigh. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful and complex books, original characters, clear dialogues, twisted plot twists. The films based on his books go back to Man (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez) among others. Even when it is done like this, movies have at least some measure of the essence of the story. This, ... simply is not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (I do not know why, because there are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. The characters are reorganized, chemistry is missing, actors and actresses are poorly distributed. <br /> <br /> As Elmore Leonard is a great storyteller, I hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing version of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you have not seen that movie, do not look at this. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not continue with this. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago, and tonight I went back to visit the video. The first time should not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how sad this sequel was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, no less than those who appeared in this movie for having done it. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and very fun. Travolta almost always like me, but it's much better in Pulp Fiction by Tarantino and in the previous Get Shorty. He clearly could not enjoy what was happening here. <br /> <br /> And I heard that Freaky Deaky, another book by Elmore Leonard, is in pre-production for the 2008 release. Hopefully they can do it. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all great.
