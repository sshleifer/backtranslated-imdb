In another of the terrible horror movies that seem so masochistic, we have a group of friends trapped in a haunted house who are killed slowly one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that sprout yellow blood and have very serious dental problems. However, the first 45 minutes are all talks, and taking into account that young people can not act out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue to recite dispassionately, this is especially painful. If you manage to stay awake with that nonsense, things will not get better ... with bad makeup in abundance and cheesy, basement gangue (not so special) effects. As for the conclusion ... well, what is the bet that the veteran who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will appear and save the day to the last two survivors (a boy and a girl, of course ?) with his mystic powers? Please ... life is too short for this kind of movies. Donate the time that otherwise you would have spent watching this gut helping the community, make a couple of shifts in a dining room or something. You will feel that you have really done something productive with your life, and you will not have put money in the pockets of studios that produce irredeemable garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's already too late for me ... now, where did I put that copy of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1/10
