The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but above all what we get is a travel notebook with a lot of footage and stuffing (and the strange attack of the leopard). The film is paused when you want it to be exciting, and tries to inject interest in the proceedings with badly organized matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in nature, right? they dedicated to hunting herbivores, but apparently the producers knew better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of shaking his mustache, and Marie Windsor is reasonably credible as the daughter of Raja, who thinks progressively (good eyebrows, by the way!). However, Rod Cameron can barely be seen when the hunter returns as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he had a lot of demand in his day, but here he presents himself as a Rent-Center Bogart: tough looking, but without Bogey's reach or time. He passes the film back and forth from Stoic anger to angry Stoicism, and every time the script tries to spark some romantic sparks between him and Windsor, you just have to laugh. That wrinkled and wrinkled face is not a good vehicle for tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not completely without merit, although it does make some strange choices. At the beginning of the first act, the script tries to pass several moments in which the heroes decide to bring the intelligent child and monkey pet, but then ignore them basically until *** SPOILER *** the monkey somehow seizes him . a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally launched near Windsor. This is so that Cameron can demonstrate his bravery by diving into it and saving his life at the expense of his own account. *** FINAL SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which I understand lasted more than 2 and a half hours), has given more things to the child and the monkey. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes the movie show its age ** SPOILER ** is the theme of woolly mammoths (the plot device that puts the safari in motion in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene was filmed, it is obvious that the "mammoths" (obviously, the elephants wrapped in stuffed rugs) are not really "attacking" anyone, or even moving so fast, and yet, Cameron starts to try immediately. To eliminate them with hand grenades. These days, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species that was thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a pleasant pace. *** END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally, Lippert hacker jobs qualify two or three stars at best of the cases). It's not a train wreck of a movie, or anything; In addition, it seems to have good intentions, since the daughter of Raja advocates improving the more repressive aspect of the "traditional forms" and the elements of the "mixed race" romance that was quite progressive in 1952. And there are some beautiful landscapes and an exotic show. . See if anyone offers it for free, but do not expect much, except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy film.
