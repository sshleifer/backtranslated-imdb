I am alarmed that people are not so critical of a job that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with 'Amadeus' on the side of 'Copy Beethoven' choose the easy path by putting the public before the art. And, therefore, deny the world a discerning, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now consider the following: Is it not possible that the true story of the creation of the ninth symphony is really an attractive and powerful story? And the same in a dramatic story? Was Beethoven completely deaf to the writing of the symphony? Is not that more interesting? How was the symphony carried out? Would not it be great to know? Then ask yourself, what possible motivation could a filmmaker have to present a woman as a copyist? If there was a copyist, it would certainly be a man. What was your story? (Please try to be a little critical, even if you like the invention of a composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy must be much more than a distortion of reality to serve the purposes of writers. For those who are comparing and justifying Anna Holtz's invention with the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in 'Amadeus', consider confessing to a priest in an asylum (Schaffer uses this device to great effect in the movie). ). "Copying Beethoven" could have worked if Anna was a product of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we are destined to believe that she is "possible" ... Yes, and that Strauss received help from extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I have read here so far are expressions of a DESIRE for the film to be good; Almost a deliberate amnesia. Remember the movie for what you want it to be instead of for what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, then consider that you are not only accepting a lower interpretation of the real events, but you also sacrifice the truth for the sake of a triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief note on acting here that may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT as good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does that surprise you? He looks uncomfortable throughout the film, like an actor in disguise, but offstage and standing at the catering table. Most of his lines are said to be keys instead of answers to the lines of Anna Holtz (that is, he is not listening to the actor). Clearly it is an actor who pretends to be the character instead of being the character. <br /> <br /> Actually, how many times does Beethoven have to shoot in his grave before we understand it well? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?
