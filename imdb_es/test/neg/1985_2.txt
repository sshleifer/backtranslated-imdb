I bought this movie on DVD despite the "past" criticism and that was stupid ... That review was completely accurate and I have never seen a worse "erotic" movie in my long life! Even if it was partly filmed in a charming way and had an interesting environment, in addition to a nice cover ... But my own films Extreme Erotica (c) are more than 100 times more erotic (only in the soft and delicious aspect) with probably Less than 100 times movie budget! The story does not have a logical connection with the first movie or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments ... So, the main male character, Klaus Kinski, I do not see. a bit like the second "O" Master, he tries to play ... And not even the lovely Arielle Dombasle looked delicious in any scene!
