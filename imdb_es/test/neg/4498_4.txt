It should be remembered that Gammera films, like many of the films in the first Gozilla series, were directed directly at children. Little Kenny and his companions are living the dreams of children in the audience: they can run and play with top-secret things, while adults wait and allow it; they get to flee with monsters, and even when bad guys come in, they're never really in danger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the first Gammera movie is an aberration because the child IS punished and puts himself in danger, but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment. <br /> <br /> As one critic said, these are not failed adult movies, but films for successful children.
