What I miss most about this movie is that it leaves no room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork movie without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the movie already tells you what you're supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched, but none is solved to make him think. I do not even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious or a serious movie that wants to be fun. Many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is quite poor. The movie is pretty boring.
