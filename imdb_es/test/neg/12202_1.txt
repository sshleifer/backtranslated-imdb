That's what I felt like shouting and leaving the theater, but I held back. Yes, the performance was excellent, no, this was not the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue simply would not end (or would be interesting)! And despite all the talks, you can never know or worry about any of the characters. Definitely the most boring movie I've seen since Sphere, but I expected that to be boring. I had to sit through this, but please, save yourself
