Nine out of nine people who saw this declared themselves mentally scars for life. No one should have to see this abomination. The English language is ill equipped to express how absolutely, terribly atrocious this "film" is. It really is not worth the plastic it is made of. The human race has not committed any major crime in the entire history of creation; There is never likely to be anything worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously agreed that the scene involving Tommy's shrunken head and the girl's blouse was incredibly sick and twisted; In fact, many of us still have not recovered from the test and are currently sitting in a corner of the room swinging, sucking our thumbs and moaning. <br /> <br /> The fundamental question on everyone's lips, however, has to be "Why?" How is it possible for someone to create such a monstrosity and then submit it to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought that this movie could be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to rid the world of "Shrunk Heads" so that no other poor civilian will expose themselves to it. . Please, for the good of humanity.
