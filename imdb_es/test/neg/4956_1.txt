It's embarrassing, I had about 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really intrigued by the nekkid photo of the "star". <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie shows what the New York film school and Sir Daddy's fortune, judging by the biography of this clown at the helm, can do for you, you and you, and that is what we have here. and, in addition, a photoshoped photo of the main "actor" with the body of another person in a still image that does not occur anywhere in the film. It's strange because in many ways the money was thrown away, obviously on a budget of low budget, but from the beginning, when all the extras are laughing in their horror scene, it's not right, maybe it would have had some charm if it had fact. For 2 cents! In a short time I skipped the scenes and went ahead to see the image in the box that was all that really mattered to me. Strange, why do not I just rent a porn or something? but wow there is bad acting, it's funny, I guess, and bad acting, just bad. Robert Englund is quite pathetic in this along with everyone else. It makes you appreciate the most not so direct to the horror video that is out there. . . bla most of which would not bother me. I should have seen Hellraiser 3 if I wanted to see a pack of 8! I imagine that the old and horny gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store will be the main tenants of this and they should start a class action lawsuit!
