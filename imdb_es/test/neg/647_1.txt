My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples and we all went out almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I've come out of. <br /> <br /> It was painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us on the way and asked us if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> That never happened before or since Pleae does not rent this. He'll really regret it. I'm really surprised by the vote summary. Maybe personal taste has something to do with this.
