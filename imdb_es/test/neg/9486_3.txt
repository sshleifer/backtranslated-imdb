This movie was good. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry to say the obvious) who against their will are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Immediately, two French children (who looked a bit inbred) start talking to them and get interested. Bla bla bla. It is a twin film of Olsen: we already know what will happen between them. Anyway, along with that, the twins meet a fabulous French model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make friends with the model and spend a fun shopping montage in the city of lights. Yes. <br /> <br /> Plotwise, frankly I can not remember what happened. I guess I could say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "The Olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls who are devastated to hear they're going to Paris? Really? Also, the jokes really were not that funny. However, I saw the whole movie. So it had to be something entertaining. The fact that he settled in Paris was what probably kept me watching.
