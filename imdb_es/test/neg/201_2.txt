This movie, despite its list of celebrities from the B, C and D list, is a total loss of 90 minutes. The plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. It was so foolish that I can not believe that I'm taking the time to write a review. Flex, for his credit, has grown in his ability to act since he played Michael Jackson in a television movie made a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, has regressed, since she was more talented in her role as Felicity's whore some years ago. While I was sitting watching the shock of a movie, with its pitiful output and horrible sound quality, other four-letter words came to my mind to rate what I thought of this movie. However, in an effort to keep my G-rated writing, I will simply say that this movie is another four-letter word that starts with an L. LAME.
