Another winner of the decade of the 50s, the 60s, that I love because of the comic value that they give with each visualization these days. The Corman never disappoints you with these films, they are taken seriously and have very low budgets, a recipe for good observation without a doubt. Ed Nelson, a very competent actor, started with Corman, as well as with many other favorites that appear in Superman and in many of the westerns of the day. The disguise is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking, well, the reverb was a little unpleasant, but that's the beauty. Making movies out of love for her, not seeking perfection, just digging the action of doing it, is achieved. These movies are a fun time! Even better is the MST3K version !!
