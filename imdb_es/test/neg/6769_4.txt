Apparently, cut out episodes of the television series Gangbusters on the big screen. Although this was done frequently in the 50s and 60s because people did not have television or color television, and the producers wanted a higher return on their investment (big screen ticket sales or if it was resale on screen) small of a series that is not (in syndication), the results were generally less than the sum of its parts.The only time I saw it work was when stories were composed of several parts (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of the anthology of terror (The Veil and 13 Demon Street) Here, the effect is to have stories of American criminals in the 20s and 30s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) interspersed with each other when a narrator talks about how the FBI pursued them ... It's a weird mix that does not work at all because it's clear that there are things here that do not belong together ... More than once I watched TV strangely because things did not look right. be fair, I will not describe the low cost of production, since this was what television (and the series) was. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be perfectly honest, the episodes of the series I've seen work best in unique episodes in which we do not expect so much. Given the option, I would rent the program's DVDs instead of this movie.
