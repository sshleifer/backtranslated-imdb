This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never seem to believe that they believe it. Are whites such monsters who will continue to call "good boys" two rapists of white children in their 20s and need to be persuaded that this could be cause for provocation? Are blacks universally inspiring? Is the Ku Klux Klan really out of courtrooms firing at lawyers without anyone intervening? Do the judges really think that a fair trial can be carried out when the jury can hear a mob outside screaming "Kill it"? Are the Negroes really standing shoulder to shoulder with the Klan waiting to hear the verdict? Do the wives really take several months to realize that their husband could be defending a man from injustice because he knew he could have done the same? Do the juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a defense of sanity to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, any high-minded principle of this movie was lost in the totally exploitative and gratuitous use of sex crime to stimulate the audience. Was it the issue of rape, let alone the gang rape of children, really in competent hands here? Is it really a subject that belongs to the hands of Hollywood? And if so, why the abduction and dispossession completely free of Sandra Bullock? And the charge for statutory rape completely useless against one of the witnesses? It seems that, after all, the director did not feel SO MUCH about sexual crimes. <br /> <br /> This consisted in taking the excellent plot from To Kill to Mockingbird and making it a source of coarse, superficial and insipid money. I am ashamed of them.
