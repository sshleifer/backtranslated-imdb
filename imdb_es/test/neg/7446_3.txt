I recently picked up the three Robocop movies in a box, quite cheap and the only reason I did this was for the special edition of the excellent first. I've seen Robocop 2 before, but not for 17 years, the year it came out. I've never seen him since, because I can still remember how disappointed he was when I discovered how truly awful he is. It really is a complete disaster, it has all the signs of a problematic production with so many subplots that are made at the same time. It also has a very uneven tone and it is also one of the most unpleasant movies I have seen in my life. I do not mind a bit of violence, the first one was incredibly violent, but this one is just unpleasant. In addition, the SFX is terrible even for 1990, greets the bad movements of stop. Also having a drug dealer, cursing a child like a villain is too much. Peter Weller, at least, had the common sense not to go back for the next one. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has a couple of nice gags, like the thank you for not smoking one and the children's baseball team stealing an electric store. To quote the child who plays the villain "Sucks."
