People can say that I am hard, but I can not help it. The movie is so bad that it absolutely surprised me. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. He was enormously exaggerated and foolish, but this one, in spite of the spooky scenes, has a really stupid story. In fact, they investigated Kayako's past and discovered that he had a mother (who speaks miraculously in English) who was an exorcist and "fed" the evil spirits of his daughter. Stupid? Yeap Well, it started with Kayako, who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with a guy and committed suicide. This part is still good. Due to this moment of rage, he became a vengeful spirit that kills anyone who enters his house. Acceotable. Now, her murders began to spread a bit where she really had the chance to travel through Tokyo just to end her victims. (His victims were traveling, right?) This hit me a lot. Now, if a ghost could do something like travel through a country without paying public transport fares, I would not mind. Ask someone to come and kill me then * snorts *. And to top things off, the ghost that was once portrayed as very vindictive (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was much better than this crap) is now represented as a ghost that really enjoys itself and feels it is His mission is to kill people. Things worsened (for me, the viewer) when the ghost became forms of large strands of hair. I mean, ??? If a ghost had such power, I seriously would care to be it. I never liked movies that depict ghosts like MONSTERS because they are not. The general results are simply bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better story and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
