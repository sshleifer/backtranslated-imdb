Today You Die was Seagal's fourth film in a mini-marathon I just made. Wow, I do not know where to start. It seems that he mutters his lines more and more as time passes, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach where they seem to improve are shameful. And what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can not recommend this to anyone, but the hardest Seagal fan dies, and even then you'll be better off with your previous work. Of the 4 movies in my marathon (Submerged, In the Sun, Foreigner and Today you die) Today was the worst. A previous reviewer mentioned this, but the use of archival images was quite obvious.
