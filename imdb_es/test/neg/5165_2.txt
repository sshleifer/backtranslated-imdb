For all his wonderful images, for all his good intentions, this is revealed as another disgustingly one-sided, over-glorified and self-promoted propaganda. <br /> <br /> The message is simple, "All Japanese" The fighting on the Kokoda track was sadistic and malicious batons that enjoyed gutting every last Australian troop, cutting their throat before decapitating them. "Kokoda not only he realizes the only fault of "Gallipoli" (that the enemy has no face, has no name and apparently is inhuman), but manages to demonstrate the opposite of Weir's masterpiece, instead of giving us a perfect movie with a defect, we have a horrible mess with a redemption function. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we are, without any kind of comfortable adaptation to the characters, presented to these apparently quite relaxed, two-dimensional people with the ones we never ... NEVER can we sympathize, we stay at such a distance that, even when we could relate so easily to the characters, they find a way to keep us away, that's just a sickly feature, and that it takes us away from the same plot, helps the horrible rhythm to leave us with a lasting impression, and makes it much easier to see the contrast between an openly sentimental ending and an otherwise dull body. movie. <br /> <br /> In other words, it drags us through a painful journey (not only for us, but apparently for them) and, just as it should end, we jump to another eye roll of a Skirmish that ends faster than it started. Therefore, for the still still without information: when it should end, it starts again, only to end when we expect more. S *** It's just a confusing and agonizing rhythm! <br /> <br /> What brings me to the ultimatum: this is meant to educate us about the events of the Kokoda track. It does not come close. It not only details a very small and insignificant part of the campaign (spraying a little "companionship" on top in an attempt to make it relevant), but manages to do the only thing that makes a movie as important as it should be, not it matters <br /> <br /> Honestly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch all the time. The audience around me, all proudly Australian, arguing about how great the movie is going to be, moaned, moaned and complained of disappointment as each of the painful ninety-five minutes dragged on (for a short time, it felt like Apocalypse Now: the difference was that Apocalypse Now was a good movie and it deserved the three hours it lasted) and to the point where suicide could be a wholehearted alternative if it were mandatory for this movie to be seen. <br /> <br /> Although, considering how much the television has been advertising this garbage, I would say it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like pretty pictures. Although it would be better if you saw The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, since they have a superior cinematography and real graphics. <br /> <br /> In general: *
