As a little fan of Michael Dudikoff, I sat down to see one of his good action characters: I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of US commandos trying to get rid of a group of Syrian terrorists who have taken control of a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the command unit and, of course, became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I must ask from when the British have had female members of SAS, as far as I know, if they are ever needed, they are obtained from other sources. Even if they did, I can guarantee they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position, or have I lost the plot? I know that there is always a romantic angle in these films, as it helps to provide the Feelgood factor, but it has to be that way, especially when there are more important things to be taken into account, such as nuclear war. <br /> <br /> The signing of the treaty on the US aircraft carrier intrigued me. The "sacred pen" worn by one of the supposed television news teams is that there were no security checks to find out who or what is on board one of these ships, especially with the caliber of the people who were in it. Keep in mind that if there were, I guess there would be no story. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but when it came to the "internal defusion of the body pump" in order to safely remove a bullet that I left in the drama and action film I enjoyed it for the comedy that It really was. <br /> <br /> By the way, would a news reporter say "Downtown Damascus"?
