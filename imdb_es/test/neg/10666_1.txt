I think I've been watching movies for the last 10 years, and I must say that I never felt so bad, which I felt after watching a large movie, it was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs. Nobody should see this movie. The director has shown the Germans who speak English, which is silly. The Germans do not speak English. And in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autographs. (Obviously he must have given her some money) In the promotion they have shown to prepare for the revolt of laughter. But I could say that there was only one scene in which Himesh was laughing for no reason, because it could be that he thinks it's funny. Hansika is very good. she is like an angel But too young only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and you do not know what to do, then you should watch this movie or, otherwise, you will lose money.
