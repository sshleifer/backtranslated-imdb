This movie was totally painful for me to see it. I understand that independent films do not have the same resources as other conventional films. But there are basic elements of making movies you normally want to join. First, skip cuts. There are numerous at the opening of the 15 minute film. There are shots in which it seems that two separate shots of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is that a character will say half a line from a shot, and the rest of the line is from a different shot. Second, the dialogue. I understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue must also be spoken in a specific tone (for example, establishing a movie in Boston, however, people use Chicago-accented West Coast jargon). Even if we understand this, it is still difficult to review some of the lines presented by these actors. These are just the two most vivid problems I encountered with this movie. There were some others. I do not want to look like a stern critic who does not know anything. I have years of experience in the film industry (what is more important, the low budget independent cinema). I also understand that with many directors there is often a method for their madness. I have not been able to discover this method used in this movie. This makes it difficult when it comes to deciding if I see this movie as an example of unique style in making movies, or just as a low budget movie. I sincerely hope it is not the last. If anyone has any idea why they did things a certain way, or if they have any thoughts or opinions of their own about this movie, I'd love to hear them. I hope I can understand more about this movie and change my current opinion.
