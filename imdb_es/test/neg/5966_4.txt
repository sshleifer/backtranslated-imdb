I really liked this movie. Number 5, the star robot of the film is struck by lightning and something happened to its circuits. Act and think more like a human. The robot repeats ads that it learns after watching television. Then apply these sayings to your circumstances. The number 5 is witty and fun. The character imitates star voices, tries to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized. The actions of the robots are really good. The number 5 wants to drive, cook and please Stefany with all the characteristics of a human being. The way the robots move and line up is really hysterical. I am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all the viewers. This movie has a surprise that ends something you would not expect. I hate the movies that have sworn in them, although I like them, I give them a lower grade. This movie had bad words. Jesus Christ was used as an oath word that offends me, is used at least 3 times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t, etc. It could have been a wonderful movie without all this offensive language. There is no sex in this movie, some violent acts, like robots that explode cars and machines.
