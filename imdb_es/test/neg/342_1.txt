I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways in which this movie is bad. The computer graphics were missing to say the least. The performance seemed rigid and incredible. Observe the sand while the lost e-pods are found (what an original name!). Where do all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, namely, Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, a huge ship to transport a prisoner? And what about the prisoner? Does he speak, can he talk? I kept waiting for something to bind the fragments of the story, but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. The only part of the movie that I liked was when it finally ended. I do not mean that I would like the end, I did not like it. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more pleasant. In my opinion. Do not waste your time on this.
