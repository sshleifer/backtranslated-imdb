Oh, my God, I had to watch this movie FOUR times in my sister's house and it was terrible the story of sex and inexplicable inexpensive guns and acting unless you're at gunpoint so you can see her avoid it Ja Rule he simply proved that he can not act Ving Rhames also gave the most frightening performance of all his films. A part of this movie did not make me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion. I would be surprised if people really enjoyed this. I look like some terrible movies in my life but this would be in my five worst movies, the music was not good and the story I think was invented by a couple of guys who asked for a pizza and sat down, wrote ten points and then turned into a movie. absolutely terrible
