Normally I prefer French films to American ones, with explosions and car chases, but this movie was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. This French couple has lived in Lisbon for years, and they return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend that they are having dinner that they are going to separate. Then nothing happens, it seems that they do not know if they want to separate or not. I do not necessarily believe that your doubts are a bad movie, it is very human to doubt before making a positive decision, but this could be treated in an interesting way, giving some meat to your wishes and your relationship, but that does not happen. One leaves the theater without knowing why they came together or want to separate. The only piece that I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk. That was true to life.
