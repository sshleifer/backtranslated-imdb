I found the Super Troopers only slightly funny at best (I thought it was a glorified police academy scam), and I rented this movie in the hope that it would be better. It was not so. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely horrible and the rhythm of this movie is even worse. It does not seem to happen that much in this movie, or that it really gives us a reason to worry about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Felix lacks inspiration, although possibly due in part to the dialogue with which he had to work. In short, this movie simply went wrong in so many places. <br /> <br /> I get the impression that, like films like Clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think they can make movies like this with long, rambling dialogue scenes. Where the characters try to be funny. But, where the dialogue in Clerks advances the story, in this film, it inevitably weighs. Movies are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue, and however tempting it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of quick and fun dialogues, it just does not always work. Especially if they are not so good at writing dialogues. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie, and that movie had such a low budget that it was shot on video.
