It was horrible, plain and simple. What was your message? Where was the movie with this? It has all the ingredients of a sub-B grade film. From a plot without arguments, bad acting to slow motion cinematography. I'd rather watch a movie that I've already seen as Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, even Grease. There are no friendly characters. In the end you just want everyone to die now. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
