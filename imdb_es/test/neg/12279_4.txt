This movie is very violent, but exciting with an original dialogue and great characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very faithful to life. The film begins with action star Leo Fong as a policeman approaching the end of his career, when he comes across a large case involving corruption, black mail and murders. This is where the murders begin. From the very beginning Fong delivery in this must see caper action. This film is also co-starring Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie as a child, but as I grew up I realized that this movie is pretty cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
