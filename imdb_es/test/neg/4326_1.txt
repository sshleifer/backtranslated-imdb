Look, some movie has become the worst of all. I suggest it's India Song. When I saw the film in 1976, I was playing at Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place frequented by people who care a lot about movies. From about the middle of the road, people just left the theater. My girlfriend would not let us go, but in the end, the theater was practically empty. I kept telling the people that they were leaving that "the good is yet to come". And went. The good part was the screen at the end that said "end". It was the only good part. I'm still upset about this movie 24 years later. It was useless, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, part 2). Look at it only if you want to spend two endless hours learning to distinguish between simply bad and simply horrible.
