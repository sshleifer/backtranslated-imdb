For a Norris movie this is quite docile. For an action movie it's a bit boring, and when it comes to predictability, my friend and I almost had every turn of this movie pinned. It was nice that all the murderer's movements were not telegraphed by the action films of the 80s cliches, but, come on, the only unpredictable movement challenges the plot and configuration of the edition. Mainly, it is said quite soon that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little-known actors) only kills women. STILL, he suddenly stops his M.O. and kill the men, eh? I suppose it can be interpreted and rationalized in some way, but why is the movie edited to show that it will kill women? <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm sure there's a reason (for example, to create suspense), but why spend time looking at it when many other suspense films are far superior? <br /> <br /> Fans of "Renegade" can enjoy Branscombe Richmond's small cameo as Victor, but his brief appearance can not save the film and even a vote of 4 seems generous. <br /> <br />
