I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At that time, I was at 8.0 and I thought, "Wow, that must be a good one". I thought wrong. The beginning of the film actually maintains what the plot promises, but then it descends exponentially below its basement. I think without the character of Richie Nix, it could have been fine, although it is the reason why the story line takes the course it takes. The character is too extreme for my taste and difficult to bear. In addition, the journey that the main character makes from the beginning of the story to his "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily have been omitted. The alternative is that I did not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that it is "easy to see", and I had no problem reviewing the whole movie, when it was over, the end did not impress me. In general, quite mediocre.
