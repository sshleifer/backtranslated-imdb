All the children seem to be sexually aroused by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But, nothing seems to be that, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for all the children she knows, but we never met Mandy or any of the characters in the film. Mandy accepts an invitation, from her student friends, to go to an isolated ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and drug. In the film, teens drink alcohol like water and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. And, there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, teenagers disappear one by one. But, the others are all drunk and tall. No one, not even those who watch the movie, cares or is worried. Nobody, including the audience, seems to care. Emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the entire event. There is a security guard, Garth (elegantly and elegantly interpreted by Anson Mount), who protects and protects the ranch. Halfway through the movie, the killer reveals himself, the tension is released suddenly like air coming out of a balloon. The events are completely predictable, and the movie is completely finished. Mandy is with her partner, but we never know why and, at the end of the movie, there is still no sex. Does Mandy hypnotize children, or does she simply take all children to death? This absolutely confused spectator can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of female and male competition, killing manipulative girls and unpleasant children. <br /> <br /> Is Mandy worth all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not believe it. The capable filmmaker (Darren Genet) provides some impressive images, but, in fact, his approach seems to be in Garth, who is quite a stallion. Not all boys love Mandy, do they? If you want to be bored enough to discover how this movie ends, my advice is to sleep halfway through the movie until you see the tempting Mandy and Garth's bulging crotch. But, do not wait for anything to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy is still a virgin, and there is still no sex. I classify this movie as 3 out of 10, but not for Mandy. Why? Because all the girls love Garth, and all the voyeur eyes seem to be in Garth in a compromising position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to go beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to an isolated ranch, and nothing sexual happens. The audience is led to horror on a ranch and can not help, but wonders why?
