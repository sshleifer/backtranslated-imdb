"Fat Girls" is one of the worst movies in the indie gay genre. <br /> <br /> The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teenager is trapped in a small repressive city in Texas. His only kindred spirits are the misfits of the other village: the "fat girl" of class, a naive immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive drama teacher. Until now, interesting. In theory, this plot creates a decent setting for an attractive coming-of-age story with an integrated audience: the thousands of gay men who grew up in small US cities and experienced this firsthand teen anxiety, peppered with a dose of humor self-critical <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, instead of a nuanced dramedy, Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt at irony and black humor. The result is a distribution of unpleasant, derived and two-dimensional characters that the viewer can not help but feel indifferent towards. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-gothic and bitter observer of navels. She is such a thorny person, without sympathy; There is little doubt as to the reason for his condition without friends. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This may have been a bad deal, but it is more likely to be due to a script that is simply insurmountable. Consequently, one wonders when there is such a non-existent link, what could justify his almost constant company throughout history. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's new boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated characters in the clichés that have been stolen from dozens of other movies. Rudy is the underexposed underexposed nordic / immigrant who rises directly from every "comedy" of affluent teenagers that has been made in the field of television or cinema. Judy is the obsessed one of being born again with the talk of Jesus and the big hair. Just when you thought that Tammy Faye's thing had been killed, Christian inserts a scene in which Judy's eyelash mask runs with her tears. Is there anyone in the civilized world who can think that this old and tired stereotype joke is still funny after seeing it in nausea for 20 years? <br /> <br /> In addition to the unsuccessful attempts at sardonic humor, there are many enigmas. inconsistencies of the story Rodney is considered an "ugly and ugly" loser. However, he simultaneously manages to participate in occasional and regular impromptu encounters with the ubiquitous school athlete, Ted (Miller). Although these links lack emotional satisfaction, most gay teens (full of angry testosterone, like their heterosexual siblings) would find this a pretty enviable arrangement, given the most common alternative of involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all credible prognosis, the boy not only lands in this small village of TX, but is also conveniently openly gay. Like Sabrina, Bobby is a smart and angry heartthrob, and the viewer is scratching his head at his magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is invited by his new boyfriend in the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival, the future boyfriend leaves Rodney alone and heads to another area of ​​the bar for a quick meeting with a pretty handsome young man. This is one more of the ridiculously inexplicable elements of the plot, since Rodney's feeling as an outcast supposedly derives in large part from his solitary existence in a parochial city. No matter how small the city, do they have openly gay students in high school? A secretly bisexual soccer captain? Lesbian moms? A gay teacher? And has a gay bar in the center (sponsored by attractive men, no less)? Apparently, the place is not that late after all. <br /> <br /> Ten years before, "Edge of Seventeen" by Todd Stephens covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, moving and funny film.
