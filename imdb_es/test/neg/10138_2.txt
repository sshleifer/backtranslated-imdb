Reba is a very silly show. You can predict almost anything that is about to happen. Barbra Jean is too stupid. It's as if she was not even a character. A program like this should have at least SOMEONE who looks like a real life person. I suppose that Barbra Jean represents a person who is behind. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person in the program, and she's still stupid. ALL ARE STUPID! That is my opinion about Reba. Since I have said all that I can say about this program, I will simply return to the following lines of text saying what I am saying at this time and I will do it until there are 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
