Esther Williams plays a romantically detached water ski secretary who yearns to stop "walking on water" and be the wife of some man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are your potential options for a husband. Despite the excellent aquatic sequences filmed in Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly past. As director Charles Walters said, everything here seems innocuous and intentional, which does not give the image a lot of staying power. Even Esther's great moments in the water are not up to the hypnotizing jumps of her other swimming vehicles, although they are preferable to the others with the men, both colorless. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as Martin's disgruntled ex-girlfriend, is the most animated of the group. Flimsy things, by the way. * 1/2 of ****
