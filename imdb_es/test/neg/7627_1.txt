Forgive me, but this work by director Peter Hall is horrible. If you can not get to us with the plot, why do not you kill someone's cat or dog? That surely reaches audiences. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. And believe me, I saw it coming before she opened the package. How predictable can you get? Take a nice animal and then kill it in a horrible way. I've never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. Exaggerated and somewhat stagnant in the interpretation, I found it quite silly and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad for having to play in front of De Mornay. He has done much better in other films, namely, "Philadelphia," where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did everything possible to maintain his real character. But the writers, Green & Rush, did a good job of preventing this with their trivial plot and insipid dialogue. Please, we do not submit to this type of entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by cheesy plots, puny animals and, in general, long dialogues. Seeing her escape with that, it made me furious.
