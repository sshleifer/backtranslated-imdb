As I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sweeney Todd story is making a lot of money at the box office and the film even won a couple of Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton does not seek inspiration and / or commercial brands with style in the "bloodthirsty Butchers" of the old Andy Milligan. Yes, although the title distinctly mentions the butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a baker. Together they form a vile alliance in which he kills customers in his store and she processes the bodies in her famous London beef pies. In other words, a premise of Andy Milligan in his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateur. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I've seen in my life, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts pure ineptitude. The production is a gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, a truly horrible photograph, a poor lighting, a terrible performance and direction, a tension or an atmosphere of gore and ridiculous zilch. More than half of the images are padded and the words do not describe how the movie gets bored, even with a run time of only 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; Do not you need to fear because Andy Milligan is not another? hands down ?? The worst director of all, but I do not think he cared. Maybe if you have a really high tolerance level, it's worth seeing "Butchers thirsty for blood".
