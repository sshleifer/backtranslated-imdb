I heard some good comments about this movie as very bloody and scary, but it's neither. Obviously, the scriptwriter wanted to make a scary horror movie, but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience. Fears and comedy rarely result in good movies, the same goes for MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> It's not really fun, nor scary, nor is it too much fun at ANY other level. <br /> <br /> Approaching 39 years of Age I have seen my share of horror movies. I've seen good and terrible, but the crop of movies released these days is so terribly mediocre that it bores me to see them. The acceptance these days of bad movies like this is what really bothers me. Let's face it, they produced a lot of garbage in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but they were also considered as such. Today they are considered "good entertainment". - Bollocks!
