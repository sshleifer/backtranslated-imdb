First of all, I'm not a fireman, but I'm in some kind of fire-fighting unit (the guys they call if an earthquake happens and the real firefighters need more people for the SAR), so I had some training and simulation . but I have no experience in real life. <br /> <br /> But still, there are some points that one considers totally incredible. I can understand that the pieces were removed from the mouth / nose of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because otherwise the public would not see anything. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - There is no second mask attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to rescue people through smoke without one? <br /> <br /> - Rappel of people. No, it is not done like that. I would also scream if someone hooked me like that and hung me from a building. If I could scream, that is, and not faint from lack of air because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time, when they're asking Jack, it's better, but it's still strange. <br /> <br /> - "Aim high". No, you do not. Always fight against fire as low as possible. You do not fight to spread flames, you'll want to put out the fire, and that's under the flames. <br /> <br /> - There is no discipline. They are running like chicken. And they scream all the time, instead of using the radio and maintaining discipline. <br /> <br /> - Without tactics. Why do not they work in teams of at least two? It can still be separated, but it takes much more than if everyone walks alone in search of victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? In Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without. <br /> <br /> - Firemen on the roof. WTF do you think they are doing there without safety lines or water? - Explosions of rooms. Wood and brick do not "explode suddenly". <br /> <br /> The best points are actually the camaraderie and the other parts of the movie that do not fight the fire. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's fine. I'll give you a point for this.
