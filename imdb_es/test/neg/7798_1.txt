I saw the preview at Femalien and I thought it could be a great movie. It turns out, it's horrible garbage. There's not much nudity in the movie, not to mention that we do not have much sex either. There were only some silly and cheesy dialogues along with some uninteresting dances that you would normally expect to see during the audition. In our case, you can even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I do not have any for that. Just leave him alone.
