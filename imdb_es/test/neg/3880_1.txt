Rs.30 / - is all I paid as rent for the DVD of the film and believe me it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood directors think showing silly is fun? Well, it's not. Please, grow up. <br /> <br /> Here is a dialogue from the movie "Agar TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOG TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI". <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is useless, criminals and police alike running after the fools. That's. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, he lived the title, I had to run away from him. :) I switched to Star Movies and watched Home Alone 2 instead, and I laughed a lot.
