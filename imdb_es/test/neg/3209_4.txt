During my childhood, I've seen the first three "Critters" movies and I've enjoyed them. They were funny and entertaining horror comedies, perfect for adventurous children and terror lovers. I have never seen "Critters 4", so I finally decided to check it out. My verdict: forgettable and quite bad movie with a surprisingly low body count. The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is predictable and clich√©, the plot starts "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets look soft and murky. The tone of the film seems to be extremely serious, which makes it slow and boring. "Critters 4" was apparently a budget so low that the filmmakers could not afford any optical effect; those that were taken from "Android" are very dated.4 of 10. One to avoid.
