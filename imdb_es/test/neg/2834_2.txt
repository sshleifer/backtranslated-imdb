I love Brian Yuzna's other work, even more raw things like 'Necronomicon', but 'Progeny' was too much even for me. My main complaint is that it is unnecessarily exploitative of the nudity of Jillian McWhirter, I am not rude, but these scenes of nudes only continue again and again ... only to end (almost every time) in a bad-tempered * wink, nudge * Sexual violence innuendo The scene in which you try to abort a coat rack after several minutes of naked screaming is a good example. The "performance" of Arnold Vosloo is completely turgid, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save this pile of movies. The aliens are bored, the boring and uniform lighting exhausts their interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a brief look at the true form of the aliens (very nice model) and the scene in which Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was also fine. But you have been warned.
