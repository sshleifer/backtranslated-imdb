I saw it on video. Predictable, horrible performance, movie failures. What else can you say, this movie stinks. The actors are annoying to say the least. This was supposed to be a comedy, but there was only a funny moment, apart from that it was painful to watch for me. <br /> <br /> 1 of every 10. PASS!
