This movie is proof that you can not go to a Redbox and read the descriptions of the movies and choose one and give it a try. <br /> <br /> Although I will give you a lot of credit for having produced a movie with decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a pretty decent script and story line ... unfortunately, it was just that : half decent <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things are not there Not everything is carefully wrapped, and you do not care about the effects of low budget, you may like this movie. Honestly, it was not really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed instead of spending my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better science fiction movie produced on a LOWER budget (!), take a look at "Primer".
