In my opinion, a good documentary, especially one that deals with controversial political issues, should be informative and as impartial as possible. The point must be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts in the subject and representatives of all parties. This movie is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men of the street" that expose the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, does not receive any serious treatment. For most interviews, the interviewer simply expects to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think about the wall?" - She does not approach random people near the wall and asks them how they have been directly affected by it. Outside of an interviewee, the Israeli general in charge of the construction of the wall, we do not have "experts" in the subject that provide us with the context of the wall (for example, how and when the project started, if it has been successful, for which groups they are and that against the project, etc.) <br /> <br /> Outside the interviews, a large part of the film consists of extended shots of scenes without incidents, such as shots of the front of the wall, construction of the Wall, and people getting off a bus. These shots take too much time, in my opinion. It's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of front wall footage (and just the wall) is excessive. Clearly, these shots (accompanied by Arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of awakening in the viewers feelings of aversion to the wall.
