The premise of this movie is ugghhhh. The guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think: "Yes, this is funny, cute and a good movie". What the hell?!?! What's funny about immature girls who fornicate with a man married to a new baby? What's so nice about the fact that he's cheating on his wife? How have you been wrong to find some teenagers to have sex before starting college? Noooo, that's not good enough, man has to be married, out of bounds, out of the market, that's what we have to have. MANY WINS! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the boy. No, she simply "loves" the way he makes her feel. Two of the girls have fun with that, they think it's fun and no one seems to have any moral problem with what they're doing. It's just shameless, but yes, all this is good for everyone on this website. The dark-haired girl even has the audacity that her dad picks her up from the boys' house, under the mockery of the nanny. This is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife? Poor woman who works and pays the bills while he screws the babysitter.
