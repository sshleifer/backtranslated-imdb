Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a "Roseanne" scam? Just look at the characters of the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the blonde older daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who is married to an imbecile (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the younger brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the peculiar relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there is the greatest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and hard style of the mother without giving her the same adorable qualities as Roseanne. Or, perhaps, they made it * too * adorable, because Reba Hart seems to hesitate between being bad and terrifying (hence Van's line with his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And being Sweet and affectionate with little transition in between. Roseanne at least managed to say that she was being cruel to be nice, since she was always mean and sarcastic and, when she tried to open up, it was difficult for her. As inconsistent as Reba's character is, it is difficult for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters had not been completely removed from "Roseanne", nothing could have prevented the program from being sub-par in the plot area. The writers try to give substance to the program, but they really can not let go of the cheesy jokes long enough to make an impact. And you better believe that the jokes are cheesy; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old boy who thinks that any joke is hilarious. Although occasionally they come out with something that is fun (I do not pretend that I have not laughed in some episodes), these gems are very few and far between to make "Reba" ingenious. <br /> <br /> In general, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious evidences of "Roseanne", sub-couple frames and sub-sub-couple of humor, and (let's face it) a terrible performance. The show could be a little better, actually, if they replaced all the actors, especially Reba herself, who has more quality of community theater than first class. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair with the good jokes that do it.
