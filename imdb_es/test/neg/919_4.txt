This film is about an actor with difficulties trying to find satisfaction in life, especially the love of those who have not tried for 5 years. <br /> <br /> Basically it is a film that presents a man with very few social skills. and he says the wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and artificial. The main character, James, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. It is more like an empty statement from which other sub-uses are derived. The sadness and disappointment after being thrown are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotions in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a funny comedy either. There are some funny liners but that's it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with a happy mood. I can not find "I want someone with whom to eat cheese" funny.
