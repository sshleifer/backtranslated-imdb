Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally, a film whose title is spoiler proof. Even for the low standards of disaster films, excuse me, let me correct myself, even for the low standards of TV disaster films, this is really horrible. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The dam modeler may have seen a picture of a dam, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity, do not. I do not know a nearby power plant, some floodgates for the water to run through, even a high voltage electrical cable or two. <br /> <br /> The dam also has little staff. Two, count them, two employees occupy the entire dam, the three shifts. And the employees were apparently imported from a World War II movie, since heroically and needlessly they have praised complete death scenes with photos of floating grandchildren. Fuck, one of them manages to get shot by the prey in a way that defies description. <br /> <br /> Special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photos of the city in a method that makes a Godzilla movie from the sixties look like the Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon in the material of the film would have given better results. Since the shots of disaster money have no value, how is the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the script and acting follow the example of special effects. This is not a diamond in the rough. This is the rough. So, is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is horrible enough to generate some laughter and the film itself has that great incompetence that makes a cult classic good, but disaster films must age like a good wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, who hides from the flood in a container with a golden retriever, can equal the great Henry Fonda being thrown by raisins that are supposed to be murderous bees. Come back with me in 2024.
