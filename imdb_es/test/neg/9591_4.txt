A potentially good idea is completely disappointed with a weak script that throws all credibility out the window, leaving the actors too little to work with. Roth covers him as best he can because he is all mouth; Hurt is as threatening as a fluffy bunny and Stamp seems unable to decide whether he is playing against a former London criminal or some toff off the field at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is nothing more than the idea of ​​the stereotypical Latina woman from all over northern Europe, who has nothing to do with temperament. If you are a fan of one of the main actors, do not disappoint or deceive yourself (as I suspect many of the other critics have done here). Look at it by all means but it is still critical; you know these guys can do better
