CUJO is a film adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I have never read the novel, but just scanning the comments page has given me an idea. I noticed a reference to the change in the end. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is as follows: a dog from San Bernardo is bitten by a rabid bat and killed. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds pretty worn now, having been made in several movies. However, it could have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel took a turn in history that was never shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing whatsoever to mention other than that the dog is bitten. Nothing else happens, nothing that scares, nothing funny, nothing that adds depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other aspect. I found this section difficult to sit and constantly shouted to the television: "Come on, start!" The events he was seeing on the screen recalled a television movie of the dramatic genre or a prolonged episode of a soap opera. Unfortunately, it only focused on one family in the film, so it could not even work at the telenovela level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but he did not have enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go to kill himself later. <br /> <br /> After the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. The dog suddenly transformed from an adorable pet into a vicious killing machine. He started attacking some people. There was also an interesting pursuit of the cat and the mouse when two characters were trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this second half too long, the suspense would accumulate well before dying again. It was just a repetition situation repeated over and over again until the movie came to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the ending, I can tell you that it was very unformed and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch. Some great camera angles add a threat to the vicious nature of the dog when it attacks people. This is particularly important because, as others have mentioned, a San Bernardo dog is not as scary as, say, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the film does not use suspenseful music to support the images on the screen. The music is too melodramatic instead of suspense. This may fit into a television movie, but it seems incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-hued movie that presents a nightmare for the viewer. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a wider problem with this film: photography. The camera work and especially the choice of colors makes it look like a very cheap television movie that one would expect to see as the daytime movie on Channel 5 here in the UK where I write this commentary. <br /> <br /> The two main actors offer good acting performances that help bring the boring segments of the film to life. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they receive. I could forgive a few moments of exaggeration by paying more attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. I will not judge the other actors because they have practically nothing to do. <br /> <br /> As someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both film adaptations of Stephen King's famous novels. I had high expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend Stephen King fans or horror movies in general to see HOW. This is one of those times when I have to recommend the book instead of the movie. Let's hope it makes history come alive in a way that the movie could not do.
