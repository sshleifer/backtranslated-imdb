This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 is because he made me laugh. Without revealing anything, a man's head really explodes in this movie. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I do not think the scene was to be fun, but it's silly. Without complete meaning. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a shame they had to go and make them stink so much.
