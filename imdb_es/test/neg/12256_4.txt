PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Monkey <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) who live in a remote country The houses are separated with the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be an extraterrestrial eater of meat, the vanguard of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite his limited budget and its pace of progress The follow-up of Norman J. Warren to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) is much more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan give themselves an obsessive relationship while living in an isolated splendor within the English countryside (interpreted alternately beautiful and sinister by the striking cinematography of Derek V. Browne), though the discovery of Annan's bloodstained clothes in a room on the floor superior marks one (or both) as the psychological disturbs so, what can explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom seem to have lived in the house at one time or another and were 'left' in mysterious circumstances. The unexpected arrival of Stokes disorganizes the relationship, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred towards men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions that result in a whirlwind of violence. There is an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner tries to "bamboozle" his clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothes, although Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery. <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is represented with uncommon grace and dignity, but this sincere sapphic bond quickly turns into episodes of sex and tidiness that please the crowd, culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan is dazzled by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (literally) heartbreaking, especially the final Annan scene, which seems to have been cropped for reasons of censorship in 1977 and has never been fully restored (what remains is still quite vivid, so be prepared!) . Excellent performances of the three drivers, reinforced by the discreet direction of Warren, who makes the most of the impressive locations of the forests, thus compensating for the budgetary deficiencies of the film. Originally released in the United States as ALIEN PREY.
