Strange, often effective zombie hippie movie, starring the unforgettable husband and wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie is not as bad as most of its kind, but it is still very high in the cheese factor. It includes several zombies in the gangue basement, an outrageously insipid dialogue, a performance by Alan Ormsby, several homosexual / perverted gay thieves and a soundtrack. The wife Anya presents a performance that is very strange, one has to wonder if she is really acting. There are many worse pictures of this type during the era (look for any flic of Al Adamson), but it is not the Night of the Living Dead. The director / writer "Benjamin" Clark, is actually Bob Clark, who created the exploitive disasters of adolescents of the early 80's, of Porky's. Only now has he resurfaced after an inexplicably good movie ("A Christmas Story") to return to his terrible ways with "Baby Geniuses". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the perverse version of "Cat People" by Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell. Moocow says take a look at this hippy horror movie to have fun, have fun with the zombies and campy dialogue: = 8)
