You know, I always like disturbing or strange movies, especially when they are shown at the fantasy film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but the subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Will this comment contain some spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I did not understand this movie. But hey, what can you expect from a movie that was presented to a festival audience? "(the festival guys) we know that not everyone will see this movie until the end" ... <br /> <br /> I like splash movies and I also like movies with strong graphic language. but this? There are many bloody scenes in this, but why? What is the director trying to tell us? Are you saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings? Or are you saying that incest will always end in disaster? who knows, not me <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for a long time, look at it. but do not wait to think "wow, I got the message", I did not understand ...
