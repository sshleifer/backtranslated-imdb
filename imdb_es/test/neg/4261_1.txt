And the worst thing is that it could have been good. But something horribly wrong. First of all, they should not have chosen Amitabh Bachchan in this movie. It is too much an icon to address such a sensitive and controversial issue, much less the paper itself. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Ram Gopal Varma should feel ashamed of himself for taking the classic Lolita story and turning it into a pathetic predictable whore festival. Her Lolita is called Jia (played by the newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, she lacks any hint of stolen innocence or that naive delicacy that one would normally associate with the complicated story of the original Lolita than in the original story , Little by little it becomes ninfeta. Jia de Varma is already a whore with an eye on the prize, even before the camera meets her. And he does not exercise chastity in the way he films his ninfeta leader. From his constant panoramic shots of his crotch to the fixations in his gestures and vulgar gestures, Mr. Varma makes sure that he does not leave a person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeurist pedophile camera angles. <br /> <br /> Oh, and let's not talk about the nonexistent chemistry between Jia and her supposed friend Ritu (the daughter of Bachchan's character). These girls are supposed to be the best friends, but they seem worse enemies even before something goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is credible until they become enemies. Maybe Mr. Varma should have worked on that aspect of his script instead of focusing on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan might have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is perhaps the servile representation of the character of the wife of Bachchan's character. Her role was so subscribed and ridiculously rigid that it is impossible to feel pity or concern for her. In fact, I felt like getting on the screen to not react as any normal woman would. Instead, she stayed there, irritated and helpless, as I imagine that a lot of the viewers of this movie would feel after seeing the train crash of a movie. Look at your own risk.
