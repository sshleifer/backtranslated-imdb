<br /> <br /> I thought that this film lacked the dramatic suspense of the building that had the first movie. This is difficult to achieve when the movie takes place for a week. The original film led to the final climatic scene for a period of one year and was still less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this movie was that the movie went relatively fast, because the plot seemed hasty. When Rachel's best friend died, no funeral was mentioned in the film. Another defeat was the participation of Amy Irving. All his scenes lowered the pace of the cinema. The dialogue in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflects the way children talk. In conclusion, this movie could have been a success, but it collapsed after the initial scene.
