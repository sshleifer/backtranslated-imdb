Typical story of an evil child chasing people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear in "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this rubbish in their résumés (actually, Schiavelli left this life with a good resume) Sometimes I wish that the killers in these movies only persecute the idiots who decide we need a new one of these movies every two months (note: that comment should not be taken seriously, I just think that the slashers have lost their touch). ). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a movie that you will do better to avoid. It's ninety minutes to two hours that I'll never go back.
