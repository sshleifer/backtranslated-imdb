Right after seeing the first one and it's very silly. By chance I saw an episode of Bones first and then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> It's very weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. There is no mention of what kind of scientist is just a matter of general science. In a program about cloning, they bring a caregiver, who was paid to discard failed embryos, to a church and made him kneel before the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask for forgiveness ... and also tell them where the bad guy is . How can they move the plot in? Now that's science at work :( <br /> <br /> There's a bit of a fool, not a fool, where Picard is enraged on a TV that announces a scream on his skin that makes you look younger, shouting "It's a lie ", as his The local assistant is groping for the local hot bobbie next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad caricature in which the bad old lady, who bears the name from dad Pinnochios to move the clumsy plot, greets Picard from the street while getting into a taxi Picard is upstairs and looks out the window with nostalgia and leaves ... she ran away. or maybe call the police ... or maybe I get the taxi number and call it or maybe I had something else ... I'm waving and taking a taxi now and there's nothing I can do about it until the next week ending ... mahhahahah. <br /> <br /> Too bad he's so stupid. "At one point, Picard convinces an afflicted father that even if a replica son was born, it would never be his son, since his son had a soul. Yes, the right people in the hat. The general scientist discusses cloning on the basis that each soul is unique and is sure why else would you want to clone. <br /> <br /> Although the general scientist Picard finds that cloning is a bit sticky, he is prepared for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that the calamity will fall on humanity if it is not allowed. He has a rather raucous tirade about how important it is. Of course he does not mention a single example. That sums up the show. Buzz words and tawdriness.
