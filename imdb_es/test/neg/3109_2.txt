Honestly, I did not have many expectations for this movie, but at the same time I had high hopes. The fact that Albert Pyun directed it, one of the best-known authors of B movies, did not wake up my hopes. I mean the amount of Albert Pyun movies that have such a high rank? Yes, exactly ... but still the movie announced a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> However, it all comes down to a squat position, since the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it continued. It lasts more than 90 minutes, but tells a story that could have been told in 30 minutes without stopping. I do not know what Pyun was doing here. I mean, the film drips an artistic style, but sometimes it's blurry and maybe it's an idiot to expect more from Pyun this time. Here it seemed that I really had a budget and a potentially good cast for the material, but everything is lost. Crazy Six is ​​not an action movie, it's nothing really. <br /> <br /> I guess the saddest thing here is the fact that I found that the final credits are the most entertaining part of the movie. The music is actually half decent with some soft female voices too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said, the better. Avoid.
