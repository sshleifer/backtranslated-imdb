In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded a male modeling agency, launching a muscle magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and a men's movie, and many of the models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. <br /> <br /> In the current years, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself today, director Thom Fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men. and a lot of penis for 93 minutes, with a bad taste and a very silly shit. I've never heard anything about this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I do not know what AMG is. In my opinion, only the gay and very specific public can like the theme of this boring and pretentious film. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fresh Meat" ("Fresh meat")
