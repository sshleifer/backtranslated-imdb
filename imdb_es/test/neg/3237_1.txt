It's hard to believe that someone could take such a good book and make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine that King Kong is becoming the monkey of an organ grinder and the role of Fay Wray in a child. How about Elton John as Rambo ?. This movie is even worse than the new television version of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> By using the title of Watchers and Dean Koontz, the creators of this film should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I have never spoken to anyone who did not like it. Another good book is The winner by David Baldachi.
