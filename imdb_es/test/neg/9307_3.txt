Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of continuous disasters and near-death experiences that resemble the Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoons. Like the coyote that falls off the cliff 5 times per episode, the "leading man" (more like a sleepy child) always manages to postpone his meeting with the Grimm Reaper. <br /> <br /> This Australian surprise "is offensively graceless, and sometimes even depressing, the 2 (out of ten) is for visual acrobatics (some never attempted by anyone since Daffy Duck) and the use of colors vivid (as in those commercials of high class national laundry detergents). <br /> <br /> There may be an age range where this "comedy" finds a following.I have definitely spent that age a long time ago. to all preadolescents: Here is a "ha-ha" for you!
