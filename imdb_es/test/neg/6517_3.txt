This film is about the encounters of 7 couples in Hampstead heath on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. <br /> <br /> It shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking a relationship, homosexuals, old people, blind dates and escort service. They are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location, so it is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, without any discernible plot. The movie jumps from one pair to another without any logic. I find this film boring and meaningless. The only characteristic that redeems is the good weather throughout the film. It's sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are wasted with this movie.
