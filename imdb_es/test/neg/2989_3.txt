I have seen comments from Turkish people (which I am not) who say that this film is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is that ... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that's exactly what this movie was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a bigger impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours of your life with this. <br /> <br /> "Distant" seems to stay forever. Many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose. I do not understand the director's goals, it does not even include many of the scenes. It is noted that the director used his own car, apartment and friends to make the film ... Well, guess what? Sample. It seems low budget. The acting is poor. If it's something cultural, so be it. I just do not understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It is incredibly boring.
