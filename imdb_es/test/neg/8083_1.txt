I thought it would be a good movie after watching the commercials about it. It was fun in some parts and some very unpleasant. The only person I felt sorry for is Horatio Sans, who has a sexy wife who cheats on him with other women. But he never had the chance to do a trio until it was okay, but they should have made it bigger through the movie.
