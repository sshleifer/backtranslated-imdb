Useless and rather silly movie that is basically a compilation of horror, science fiction and suspense movie clips. There are unnecessary shots for an audience watching the videos and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the members of the audience who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. It's not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("the horror of the cinema helps us deal with the real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theater") and it is quite trite. Also the clips are displayed very quickly and the changes are a bit jarring. And, shown out of context, these bits do not give much fear at all. And it's really short: I saw it in a theater in 1984 and I was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84 minute movie. be enjoying themselves. For people who are interested in learning more about terror, this can be fun and interesting. But if you're a terror fan (like me) you'll probably get bored like a fool. Good idea, bad execution (no pun). I give it a 3.
