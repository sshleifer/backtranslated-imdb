I'm writing this while I watch the DVD. I grabbed the computer and went to IMDb during the first song. I did not know anything about the movie, except that a friend told me that the show was supposed to be good. It also has a decent Netflix rating, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Maybe on stage this worked. But I have to say that the sight of the choirs dancing and singing completely naked seems silly. And lip synchronization with a pre-recorded score adds to the strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of ​​nothing, I'm sorry. The score, so far, is generic music. Nothing memorable, not particularly melodic. Everything is to serve the letters. What, I have to say, sounds like they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially an extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they could work. These unique jokes of several minutes do not. <br /> <br /> Now I'm watching the movie in chapters, a few minutes until I understand the essence. Hoping that one of them is different or entertaining enough to prevent him from moving on to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> It's fine. I finished. So here is what I think. If you have any experience or appreciation of musical theater for a long time, avoid this, it just is not quality. However, if you are a gay in your twenties and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you could be entertained. Or maybe this would keep your interest if you have never seen many attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
