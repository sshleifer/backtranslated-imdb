This film was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. The scenes in which Father Merrin is lying in his bed and his flashes of a small native are signs of bad acting and little imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. At one point, the doctor says she believes the city will "explode soon" for all the crazy events. In fact, there was nothing in the movie that made that line relevant. Because of the terrible work that the film had done, I never would have known that there were tensions in the town. If you like cheesy movies, rent this, but if you want this to be done well, check out Exorcist: The Beginning
