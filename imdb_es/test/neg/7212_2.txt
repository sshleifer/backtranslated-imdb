Well, let's be fair. Following a cult classic like Road House is not an easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and you will get a monumental task. So, with Patrick not on board, whose head idea was to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? I will blame the director who did not even provide 5 minutes of decent images throughout the entire movie. I was surprised that they got Will Patton (Armaggedon) to jump on board. Johnathon Schaech did a good job with the leader, but the writing was atrocious. Rejecting his dark partner (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the movie made me want to expel him right there. But I stayed with the movie hoping to take a look at that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the Double Duece. There is no such luck. The cover of the DVD is very funny, they show these two stacked blondes that make an appearance of 10 seconds in the movie. Costar Ellen Hollman also has a decent performance. But again, the effort is useless in a piece of garbage and misfortune like this. Has Jake Busey ever been cast in a decent movie? Could not they attract at least some actors in the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? Even one of the old gorillas or two, or Jeff Healey for a performance would have been good. Remove this movie from your queue immediately. -LostFlix
