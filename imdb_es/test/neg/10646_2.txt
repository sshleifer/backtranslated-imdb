In the XXII century, an architect named Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) seizes a space station, which he personally designed. As can be predicted, a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put the Merchant in custody. When they arrive, they find him participating in a strange ritual with the use of a mysterious cubic. During the interrogation, he reveals that they must let him finish, what he started or the hell he freed will be bathed in blood ... To convince the officers who have him captive, he remembers his inheritance, the toy maker he built and about the reasons why he's here in space ... <br /> <br /> The movie that is essentially the same for Hellraiser, that The Quickening went to Highlander. Something that should be ignored and forgotten, as it will not have much influence on the Hellraiser story. By far, the most trashy of the franchise with a much lower feeling than its predecessors (that we face it were the films of class B or C). <br /> <br /> Acting sometimes seems to be influenced by a medium-budget porn movie with incredible wooden performances that really make you think: When are you going to undress and start intercourse? Surprisingly, there is not much sex in the film, although the introduction of the seductive-demon Angelique (a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily confuses with what we know of Hellraiser's world) offers ample opportunities to make love. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film consists of three separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) stuck abruptly, which lack focus and are thrown in an amateur way. The end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to any of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Some decent gore in the movie, but other than that, it's a complete failure. .
