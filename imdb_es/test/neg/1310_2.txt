I really do not joke when I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable to watch on Sunday night on ITV4. <br /> <br /> The underground scenes are simply horrible when London supposedly has less than 30 feet of water, the character of Robert Carlyles is monotonous. The team of police commissioners reminds me of something that Kate Moss vomited and Nigel Planer seems VERY old, in fact, I'm worried that she suffered a stroke while filming. <br /> <br /> The father of Robert Carlyle who was 'right' obviously has been carrying too many Ketamin and, although he has an important part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be killed on the ROAD before he was caught. posing as Kate Winslett (Titanic) while hanging from the Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love the movie, but I avoid them at all costs.
