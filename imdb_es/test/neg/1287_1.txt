This is a bad waste of your time. I probably prefer to go see some documentary than this; It is really so bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is really terrible, and it can be said that the producers had a low budget due to the terrible image quality. It is, by far, at the lower end of the scale; Do not waste your money with him. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that the person who made this movie would think that it would do well. I had to see it with the children when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the children. Even the children (3, 4, 6 and 8) thought it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other commentator, SpongeBob would be much better to see than this. <br /> <br /> In general: Just do not look at it. Do not do it Do not do it
