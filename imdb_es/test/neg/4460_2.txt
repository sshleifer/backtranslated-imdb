"Dracula A.D. 1972" by veteran British television director Alan Gibson qualifies as one of the less appetizing entries in the Hammer Studios series about Bram Stoker's immortal bloodsucker. Actually, this represented the first time since the memorable "Horror of Dracula" by Terence Fisher (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as deadly enemies. They would repeat the same papers a few years later in the last Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic rites of Dracula". In addition, it was the second to last Dracula for Hammer in which Lee served as the infamous fangster. For the record, "Dracula A.D. 1972" was the seventh Dracula of the Hammer. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something very different from what the rest of this disappointing horror film produces. The eternal rivals, Count Dracula and his nemesis, Professor Lawrence Van Helsing, literally lie in each other's throats on a runaway carriage in London's Hyde Park for a scene of vigorous openness that makes everything else seem comparatively anticlimactic. . The carriage crashes and Dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its broken spokes embedded in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee has to grab this broken wheel against his body, but the images are shocking enough in his own way to pass the exam. The Count expires and so does his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples snatches the Earl's ring and picks up some of the vampire's ashes in a jar to safeguard them. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton's script precipitated the action at the age of one hundred in London in 1972. He meets a handsome young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame from "No Blade of Grass"), who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies who make parties and lead the British police with their antics. Alucard turns out to be the descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Now, Alucard has the earl's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to organize a black mass. He invites his fashionable friends, including Laura (the super sexy Carolina Munro from "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something different. It is not surprising that the Count is resurrected, and the evil bloodsucker puts his eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body is discovered drained of blood, the inspector of Scotland Yard Murray (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") requests aid to the modern daughter of Van Helsing, Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants revenge on Van Helsing by taking the latter's granddaughter as his girlfriend. Lorrimar tracks Alucard; They fight in their Chelsea apartment, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. Remember, running water is as lethal to vampires as sunlight and the crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the deserted church with his daughter waiting for the Count. Van Helsing and Dracula entangle. Van Helsing throws holy water into Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a stake that waits for it and decomposes again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we do not have enough of Lee as the Count, although I get considerably more from Cushing as Van Helsing. In addition, screenwriter Don Houghton keeps Dracula confined to the ramshackle church and never allows the vampire to venture into the city. Despite its low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" could have been much better. The scene in which the contemporary Van Helsing has to write down Alucard and write it to obtain Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You would think he would know about this backward spelling trick. Unless you're afraid of horror movies, it will make you yawn. Occasionally, Gibson presents us with an excellent close-up of Dracula with his fangs uncovered and his eyes bloodshot, but this is as scary as this refrigerator, and that does not say much.
