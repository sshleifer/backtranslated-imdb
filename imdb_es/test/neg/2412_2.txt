The only good thing about this film is the artwork on the H. R. Geiger promotion poster. The protesters against nuclear weapons that looked like punk rockers from the late 1970s and somehow became nonviolent, (except for their leader, "Splatter") occupy the cities. The boys of the fraternity descend on the punkers to violate them and turn them into victims. The bad performance and the bad plot then descend on the real victim, you, the spectator. I gave this one a "2" because some sexual scenes at least give it the potential of MST3K. <br /> <br />
