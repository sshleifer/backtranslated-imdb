An assassin of Asian riflemen takes victims in Niagara Falls and in New York City before being hit by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, who received a dub "Southern Belle" to prove she is from Alabama) finds a connection between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and intends to investigate. This takes her to New Guinea, where she promises a poor quality guide (Robert Kerman, that is, the American porn star R. Bolla) $ 80,000 to help locate her sister. After barely passing through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who is under the control of Jim Jones-style cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical crazy guru-like things, like passing LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping Agren with a giant dong soaked in cobra blood. Occasionally, a character will look to the right or to the left and see a bloody scene raised directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both of which were also directed by Lenzi). I'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we get the scenes of killing of awaited animals (gutting a crocodile, natives that eat live snakes), plus a little extra nudity and a castration. Me Me Lai appears to give her breast implants another exercise session interpreting a widow who is beaten by three of her brothers in law, in addition to the ashes of her newly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a teacher and does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> So anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you will practically get a promise with all the nudity, the blood, the dead animals and the bad taste that you expect with one of these titles, so if you are a dog of bad death, take care of it. Personally, I got bored with that in half and just wanted it to end. The original (very clipped) release of the US UU In 1985 it was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE to deceive people and make them believe that they were actually renting EMERALD FOREST from John Boorman. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN LIVES BY CANNIBALS!
