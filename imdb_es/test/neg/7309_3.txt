The figure of Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is, in fact, associated mainly with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy by Ernst Marischka (50's) where beauty, sweetness, sweetness, but also history are always present. This was the Sissi, perhaps a myth for some; However, a powerful representation. The spirit of the greatness of the Habsburgs, as well as the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and simplicity, influenced much of those films. They simply had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, although it was made 50 years later, seems to be an incorrect representation of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; however, it does not happen to add much, but it deprives the whole story of much. Let me analyze it in more detail. <br /> <br /> In September 1898, Sissi embarks at the port of Geneva. Accompanied by her maid of the court, she goes to visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), to whom she will tell the whole story of life to meet in this tragic life. The action consists of flashbacks of important moments in Sissi's life, however, these moments present themselves in a chaotic way and, therefore, someone who does not have much knowledge of Austrian history can be confused or confused completely. Much attention is drawn to the bad marriage of Sissi with Emperor Franz Josef. The scene of their wedding night is a failure. Nobody treated an empress like that (I mean undress and pay). The approach in which Sissi is misinterpreted is historically correct, however, the points at which her views differ from the rest of the courtiers are not the true ones. Where is your desire for peace? Where is your love for your nation? Where is your charity? Sissi seems to be quite elegant, modern, liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). She worries mainly about her appearance that is not historically true. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the movie. "Once the women will wear pants" is a phrase she says and appears as the image of Sissi presented in the film. Sissi detests the monarchy, which is the notorious criticism of the film towards the Austrian empire. In addition, she partially accepts anarchist movements and, to my surprise, she blames her husband, Emperor Franz Josef, for the death of Rudolph, his son. Where is it mentioned in the story that Sissi was present in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the mother-in-law, is best shown, however, the scene of Sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation is a bit clich√©. <br /> <br /> I regret criticizing so much but another crucial aspect of the film that I find weak here are the performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments as Sissi, in general she does not adapt to paper. She looks more like a "women's story" than a tragic empress. Her makeup is seriously inaccurate, as are most of her gestures like the Empress. Malik Zidi is a bit better than Rudolph and can be considered as the one that increases the value of the performances, in general. However, Stephane Audran does not do a special job like Sophie: you just do not have the impression of why she hates Sissi. She despised her for the good of Sissi's young age while she was crowned, for her behavior, lifestyle and beliefs. It partly appears in the film but that's definitely not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was an earl, honor, patriotism ... here, it seems to be a kind of libertine thought just to make love to his queen. And the portrait is so weak that this performance is very pale. The correct choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, it really fits the role with her appearance and her gestures. But, unfortunately, its role does not require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this movie are some pretty authentic costumes and places. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of the death of Sissi is presented as a good surprise of the film. It does not seem to be what it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolic perspective ... the empress walks and does not know anything that this is her final moment. This is how she must have felt about it, this is how a demented man destroyed part of the greatness of the world. Another good visual moment was when Sissi speaks with her son Rudolph in Corfu. But these moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, tries to cure the sweetness of Sissi's trilogy, but it seems to offer nothing creative. The charm is gone, the greatness is gone and the story is ignored. It's not worth looking for! 3/10
