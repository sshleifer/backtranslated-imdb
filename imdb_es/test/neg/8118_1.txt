Unless there is a great ironic conspiracy going on, I was speechless when I read the positive reviews of this film; I can not believe that this movie has been released, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I admit it's not my kind of movie, but I tried to see it objectively anyway, you know, so bad is funny, and I was still offended by its total horror. <br /> <br /> The performance is atrocious, they can not have seen the rush and I guess there was a shot per scene, it really is that terrible. It's the worst movie I've seen in many years, in fact, I would not even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom nobody calls "gay", is implied because he is so crazy? Homophobia This is not good, in fact, this is totally induce vomiting. The jokes die in their pathetic asses, the music is so bad that it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack chose essentially the most bad and mutilating songs they had ever heard and put them in this movie junk. Oh, my God, I can not believe that the 80's produced such a big garbage, I grew up through them, and I can not find anything worth noticing here, it must have been a dark time to be a movie buff. <Br /> <br /> If you even contemplate seeing this movie go to see a psychiatrist, you will consequently slap you, your sick person, the sick person.
