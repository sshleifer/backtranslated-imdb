I recently saw this movie because I'm a big fan of Kinski. But, oh my God. Do not get me wrong. You loved this boy. But in this film, all his acting is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately he is not the only one to blame. First, the whole story is totally weak when it comes to armed men looking for a murderer, while Kinski is imprisoned in prison for a crime he did not commit. That is all. All the dialogues and the characters are so bad that they make you scream. But maybe that's the fun of it all. If you know Kinski's biography, it's obvious that Kinski did not care about those movies. Especially all his Italo-Western papers. He only took the money and that was it. Again, this whole movie is totally strange. Only for hardcore-Fans of the genre.
