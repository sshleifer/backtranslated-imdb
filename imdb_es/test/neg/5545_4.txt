Academy Award-winning actor Sidney Poitier, from "Lilies of the Field," resumes his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs in 1967's Oscar-winning Best Picture, "In the Heat of the Night," for veteran director Gordon Douglas in his tired and uninspired sequel "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs," with no one the equivalent of Rod Steiger with whom to exchange dialogue. Clearly, both "Bullitt" Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were out of the game when they wrote this predictable police procedure. The dialogue is monotonous and none of the characters is interesting, not even the main suspect. Absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful, or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In the heat of the night". He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia Police Department, Pennsylvania. In "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs", our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair from "Change of Habit"), and a family, a young rebellious son, Andy (George Spell from "The Naked Kiss"), and a younger and more affectionate daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell of "Hickey and Boggs"). Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds the house and hangs over her two children, since she does not have much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. In fact, the best of "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" is the fantastic orchestral soundtrack of Quincy Jones with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this unforgettable crime thriller deserved. <br /> <br /> It all starts sensationally with a fight The prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne, from "The Adventurers"), was beaten to death in the bedroom of her apartment in the center of the city by an invisible assailant . The handyman of apartment Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of "Intruder in the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds her dead on the carpet with a bloody forehead. He picks up the statue briefly and then replaces it on the floor and reports Joy's death to the department superintendent, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe's "License to Kill"), and Weedon gives Mealie a handful of dollars and he sends it to pack. . Then, Weedon anonymously notifies the SFPD that the popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") beat Joy to death and it seemed that he was leaving Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") assigns Tibbs to handle the case; It seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Naturally, Tibbs' wife, Valerie, can not believe that the known politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the context of the film, it should be taken into account that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word "semen", undoubtedly a controversial term to mention in a film of the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Tibbs asks Weedon who he suspects is a drug dealer or a pimp. Weedon explains that she has no records of Joy Sturges because she was subletting the apartment to another real estate company. Tibbs visits the real estate company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") flees and moves away, essentially making an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a long but docile pursuit. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows her to leave, with his disgusted wife, Marge (Norma Crane of "Penelope"), prepared to file for divorce after revealing that he paid a prostitute to stay in an apartment. . <br /> <br /> Tibbs tracks the handyman Mealie and clears him of the crime, and then pursues Weedon. Luckily, for Tibbs, our hero traps the evil Weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. One of Weedon's henchmen assaults Tibbs, but Tibbs dispenses with him briefly before embarking on a long chase on foot after Weedon. Finally, he corrals Weedon in an underground parking garage and shoots him. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the Tibbs house are more interesting than their investigation. Andy runs rampant, beating his sister and smoking in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs hits him three times on the jaw. These scenes of raising children probably could never be handled today as they were in 1970. At the end of the film, as if to solidify the family sequence, Tibbs is seen walking with his wife and children. There is a confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the welfare of their children and how they have been affected by their long hours of work. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas leads competently. Surprisingly, for a movie released in 1970, filmmakers never play the career card. In one scene, when Tibbs searches in a billiard room owned by an African-American, we see a mixed race that frowns at the hero when he finds Mealie and goes with him. <br /> <br /> Together "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" is a bad follow-up to "In the Heat of the Night". Of course, Poitier offers another excellent performance with nuances, but everything seems prefabricated. All the scenarios seem false and there is not much physical violence: a shooting in an underground parking lot that does not last long and a fight. Beyond Jones' seminal jazz score, the only surprise, and it really does not qualify as a big surprise, more as a convenient contraption, is the ending. "The organization" of Donald Medford followed "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" as the second most action-packed sequel.
