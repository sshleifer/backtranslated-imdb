I never comment a movie, but I must say that this was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I feel it was done by a beginning film student and not to insult talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the main actress and I felt that I was in acting class with her while I was in the movie. Her decisions were very safe and I feel that she was imitating other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was stronger than the actors themselves. The ending may have made a little more sense if there were someone to narrate the events and not a song. I love Patsy Cline, but their songs appear quite often in the movies. Maybe the selection of the song could have been a little more original. The song "loco" was a clich√©. As I said before, I never commented on movies and I've seen my share of the good and the bad, but this was the worst. Sorry.
