I accidentally caught this in the middle channels. Immediately I recognized almost all the cast members, with "great" haircuts on one side, and I wondered what kind of movie could attract as much cast of past and future stars. Having not seen the original, I assumed it could be Poseidon's Adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in danger. I was wrong! I can not, for my life, imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with so much garbage. There is no story, all the performances seemed forced, the characters are a parody of the usual roles of the disaster film that suddenly come together in an event, and they begin to pontificate about the real meaning of life at the level of the philosophy of the sticker. > <br /> It's only worth seeing the unusually terrible performances of great characters like Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They must have needed the money very badly. Can we blame the director?
