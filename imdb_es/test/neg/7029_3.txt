This movie was horrible! Ashley Rose Orr, although a talented tap dancer and singer (actually a little better than Temple in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character as the Shirley we saw on the screen in her films, whether she is playing her character on screen or off screen. So, what we get is an excessively monotonous and totally unrealistic portrait (not to mention that it's not interesting). If you want to see that side of her, you can only rent one of her movies. The only bright light here is the representation of Connie Britton from the Gertrude Temple. I do not think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. Save yourself the trouble and rent The Poor Little Rich Girl.
