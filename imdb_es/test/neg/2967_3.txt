There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a couple of characters were developed and not so well. There were parcel holes big enough to drive a truck. The rhythm crawled like an old man. There were many moments in which the film never pleased Coco undressing. What happened to her? What about Garci's sister? Is it better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing from him. What's wrong with the electronic piano kid? What about the rich girl who had an abortion? What happened to her? That was an interesting secondary plot. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a good movie and I recommend another musical that is in this movie. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE TUNNEL OF TIME AGAIN !!!!!!!
