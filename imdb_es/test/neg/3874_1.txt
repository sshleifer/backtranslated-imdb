This movie had potential. The script was not bad, and presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regrets and, as Chris says, "10 years without going anywhere." It is a stark contrast to the original MAG7, which was bright, fun and even that the bad guy was friendly. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting change of tone, and if they had developed the characters more, maybe I would. I liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead, they waste too much time on gratuitous (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. At one point, you see the fall of a horse and, 5 seconds later, you see the same scene again. But not many people would notice, since there are already 2 dozen horse trips (I'm not exaggerating), and by then we have already fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the title of my review. This film was greatly reduced due to cruelty to animals, so it is likely that (if you decide to see it) you will get the child and diluted version. There is a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly, when the crowd erupts cheering, there is no bull, only the killer in an empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I do not know. Most likely, the scene has been cut. <br /> <br /> Then there is a cockfight scene in which, in the original version, one of the birds looks terribly mutilated before a crowd of Mexicans cheering. This was cut But we still see enough to get angry a lot. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are horse-drawn shots. One after the other, you see that the horses' legs are ripped off, sending thousands of horse pounds to his head. In one scene, a horse is thrown, and then, as it writhes on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive fires just below its neck. <br /> <br /> This movie was made in 1966 when Hollywood was starting to appear. Regulate animal brutality in the cinema. This is probably one of the last movies where you can see it happen. So if that kind of thing floats in your boat, take a look and you'll get a little excitement. But if not, you will be irritated or bored.
