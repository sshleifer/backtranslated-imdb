This very low budget monster movie focuses on a group of mine inspectors who explore an abandoned gold mine to see if it is worth reopening. They get trapped after a cave and discover that they are at the mercy of a strange and thin creature that seems intent on knocking them down one by one. The word that came to my mind while watching this movie was "desperate". The script and the acting are terrible, the effects of the stop-motion monsters were unintentionally funny, and since most of the film takes place under underground lighting, the scenarios seemed convincingly a logistical nightmare. All that was said, however, for some reason, I felt that this film failed not for lack of effort, but for lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. Everything came out as if it were a university project or a first movie made by amateurs, I feel a certain affection for films like that, even when they are completely lost. I guess what I'm saying is that I give it a B for effort and a D for real results, not insultingly bad as some low budget monster movies I've seen but that are not worth seeing unless you have a LOT of free time in your hands. I'm voting for a 4.
