This movie includes 2 well-known actors that I have previously enjoyed watching. There the actions are great and each action is felt in the heart. But it makes me think that these 2 people were sent to a speech / drama class at the university for the first time and that they were told to act in a domineering and restricted way in the room without allowing her to leave and that the woman was truly innocent and will try. she with enough mental capacity to lead the audience to mourn for her release. <br /> <br /> The only good part is the acting skills, the plot has the same trick as the influence of Hitlers and I started to hate the protagonist for that. But all this could have been done in 15 minutes in my opinion, so prolonging it for more than an hour was a pure punishment for all who saw it. <br /> <br />
