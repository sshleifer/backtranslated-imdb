This has to be the scariest piece of cinematic shit I've ever seen. It makes Mel Brooks films worthy of an Oscar in comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of classics like "The Texas Massacre" or "The Night of the Living Dead," the production value is not It is the ability of VanBebber to launch and present a plausible plot.The casting is deplorable.For the role of Charlie, he must have chosen the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair.It does not matter that this actor's hair came up half of his back (Manson never passed much beyond his shoulders) this actor spoke in a terrible monotonous tone without a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies loaned to his Manson performances ... The actor chosen to perform "Tex" Watson had curly blonde hair instead of straight, dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown the remotest interest in Manson's case knows it, he looks like a Minnesota farmer in "Little House"on the Prairie ". The actress who plays Susan Atkins has a wider butt than Oprah, while those familiar with family members know that "Clem" was considered somewhat delayed, the actor who portrayed him did so in Talla Relaxed way, it was like watching an old vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like a swollen, alcoholic trailer crap. VanBebber accelerates filming in some places to achieve an artistic effect, but this technique has not been remotely useful since "The Munsters". The final credits list all known family members, however, we are never presented with the majority of them and those who present us are not sure who they are sometimes. <br /> <br /> The facts are also destroyed in this movie. "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger did not cut his throat. Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the murder of Himnan? Patricia Krenwinkel never wore a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most disconcerting aspect of this movie is what modern "monsters" had to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo? What was your problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Sacred mackerel, I could go on and on, but space prevents it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching its head while repeatedly saying "What the hell ---?"
