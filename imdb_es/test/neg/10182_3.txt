Wow, just wow. There are already many comments about this movie but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most of the critics who have said that this film has a terrible acting, writing and direction. However, I think there are other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is the Christian belief and the concession for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? Does the movie act as if you can not be a Christian and also allow the possibility? Why? In the film they briefly deal with this (ie, "The Bible does not say there are extraterrestrials." "Well, the Bible does not say it does not exist"), but the real answer is never answered. The Bible does not really say there is not. So, how about we deal with the question instead of dismissing it immediately? Or better yet, recognize that this is an infinite universe in which we live and if we believe in an infinite God there. It is the possibility that he has made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. Why are the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and jokes? What happens with sleep paralysis? Night terrors that have been linked to kidnapping experiences? And if it is something completely different? Pity that the filmmakers have already made a decision. <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers affirm that all those who have had kidnapping experiences have had links with the occult. That's a pretty big claim without any objective evidence to present. I'm not necessary He argues that they do not, but if you are going to say something, it is better that you have the data to back it up. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the greasy-haired Blond, the other) always have his hands in his pockets? It is difficult to take someone seriously when they constantly play pocket pool. <br /> <br /> I wish it had been an exploration of the Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too concerned with their "Message of Faith" to worry so much about making a movie that makes us think. As a Christian myself, this saddens me.
