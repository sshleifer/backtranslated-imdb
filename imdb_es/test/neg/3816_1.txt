To say that this movie is worse than suffocating with your own diarrhea is a generous underestimation. The only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of trash in a movie is the shmuck that the producers pay him to register a lot of accounts to post a false rating. <br /> <br /> If you're seeing an evil act, without suspense, Losing a movie about Sloth from the Goonies kills people in a way that completely ignores all the laws of physics (pulling on the legs of a rampant person, make them ripped off the torso) is your idea of ​​a good movie, and then set aside. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life form with an operating occipital lobe would consider in a million eons that this movie is frightening or entertaining.
