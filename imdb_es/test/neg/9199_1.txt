It's just a bad movie. It's not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. I was hooked at the beginning and then I got completely lost. After that, I acted very far and then I went very far. Do not watch this movie at all costs, CONFIDENCE IT OF ALL MY HEART !!!! The directors who are brothers are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS, who made really great movies like DEAD PRESIDENTS, FROM HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. The only person who made me see this was the performance of Paris Campbell, who will be a great actor one day if he makes better movies than this one. Christina Caparoula also did a good job for what she got. I hope THE FITTEST is 10 times better than this piece of garbage!
