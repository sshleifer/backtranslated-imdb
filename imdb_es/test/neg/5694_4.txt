I am willing to tolerate almost anything in a science fiction movie, but this was almost intolerable. While some of the special effects are very interesting (landscapes), this is not a "combat space" but a strange and disconnected relationship between mother and daughter with science fiction concepts. The performance (wood), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and With more "hand-in-hand" combat scenes than any chopsocky movie in Hong Kong, this movie bores. The plot line is complicated and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), the unexplained scene jumps and a lot of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that the writer and director is not a good idea. Save your love for science fiction for something else instead of losing a little here.
