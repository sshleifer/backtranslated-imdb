What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I really sat down and looked at him. An effort very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic, without any type of redemption. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The "racing" sequences are ridiculously horrible, and the plot was so bad that I forgot it. Part of the film was made during the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium, I think, in 1988, during the current Grand Prix. I was there and I'm glad I did not appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the movie. It could have been good ... what a pity.
