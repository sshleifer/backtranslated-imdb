Many people are standing in front of the house and some women are crying ... Men standing in nearby groups and talking in low voices ... a couple of men come in and are discussing how sexy the daughter can be today ... You will soon know that someone in the house has died ... The wife of the dead person is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting next to her gives her an idea of ​​facilitating the problems by preparing simple roti sabji .. One the son of the deceased is talking to someone on the phone, his daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother suggests that she use salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will visit her house and that's why he prefers jeans and T-shirt over Salwar Kameez ... another son asks his mother to finish all the kriyas and also tells him that he should not be expected to come early from the office ... Then, the camera focus slowly on the mu ertos. Person ... The white cloth that covers the face is. displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... It's Anupam Kher ... suddenly the alarm sounds and he gets out of bed ... Is it his dream or a flash back? U will not get an answer until the end of the movie ... Well, this is the wat comedy for director Dibakar Banerjee! Later, you will discover that this scene has nothing to do with the film itself and, therefore, makes it all obvious that the previous description was a dream. Is this a movie comedy? Well, it's supposed to belong to that category ... But it really does not! There's nothing remotely associated with comedy in the movie. More about the director gives the message that nobody will receive justice from the police! So everyone must cheat cheaters !!!! or forget about justice! The music of Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla is fine ... There is not much to tell about other sectors ... Bad scripts destroy everything ... even the performance of Anupam Kher does not make it at least a palisaholic .. .
