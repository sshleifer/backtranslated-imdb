What a terrible sequel. The reason why I give this film two stars instead of zero is because it is a movie that has violence, gore and creatures, but it is badly planned. And this frightening sequel was made by BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bone head that brought you The Shining remake that almost made Kubrick almost roll in his grave when he discovered it was really done. Garris is also the man who brought you the sad sequel to THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful movie, but the Garris movie almost ruined John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the trilogy of shit bugs in order, do not do it. That's the mistake I made, rent the first or the third or, better yet, DO NOT STOP THIS LEVEL AT ALL! This movie is so bad that I can not believe it, please avoid this shit. What a shame, Mick!
