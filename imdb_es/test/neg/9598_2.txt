A melodrama of early talkie without hilarious grace with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the film, she "pulls back" the boy from the barn for being too young before leaving for the driver! The English ensemble of high tone in which he moves is such a clich√© group of harpists that it is ridiculous. But the protagonist is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with the accent of Chico Marx! "My violin! How well I've played once!" "Patreecia, my meelk is cold!" It is campy beyond belief.
