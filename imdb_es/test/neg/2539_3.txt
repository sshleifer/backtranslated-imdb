On a flight back from London, I saw She's the Man; Apparently, Air Canada has a junk movie policy. Maybe that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to be part of a team in a boarding school throughout the city. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6-hour flight you must do it), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mainly from the comedian David Cross as a principle, but the intricate polygon of love really does not inspire emotions, although it mixes intelligently (with the warning of senseless plausibility). The ending is as ridiculously foolish as the rest. I suppose if I were a 12-year-old girl, I could have really enjoyed this one.
