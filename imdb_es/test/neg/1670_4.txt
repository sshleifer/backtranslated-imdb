This movie seems a bit clumsy around the edges, as if it had not thrown enough zaniness when it should have been. But most of the time I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The story is more than a little absurd, so you should not include any expectation of "something real" in your visual experience. Check your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and could be an impediment to the contrary. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed Clennon's performance as the real Dr. Baird. His role was perfect to give the character of Aykroyd a protagonist. What a putz was the real Dr. Baird. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as the main character's partner. Annoyed at first, but finally adorable. A kind of Mas or less. Or at least something, the use of a bar of soap and lots of water would have been more than useful. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth seeing? If you're in the mood for a parody in the psychiatric profession, of course, why not?
