The Crazy Monster begins in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) while perfecting his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject that turns out to be his silly servant Petro. (Glenn Strange), apparently plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department, who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the best soldier! However, first things first, since Dr. Cameron has his sights set on a sweet revenge on people who dismissed his experiments, forced him to resign and subjected him to a ridiculous public. Dr. Cameron implements his plan and uses his monstrous creation to assassinate Professor Blaine (Robert Strange), in an unfortunate turn of events. Dr. Cameron can not control the beast and is seen by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news like a forest fire, in another unfortunate coincidence, a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) finds out about the History and begins to investigate, begins to suspect Dr. Cameron and since Gregory is dating his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) has many opportunities to sniff ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Sam Newfield, this is a very low budget item from the 40s, and worse, it's a bit boring and unoriginal. Fred Myton's script drags the extremely thin premise to almost 77 minutes, which is too long, there's no variety in the story and it's basically the same thing over and over again. The characters are stupid clichés, the mad scientist who carries out useless experiments that create a monster, the fragile and pretty daughter, the reporter who plays the hero and, by sheer coincidence, investigates the mysterious deaths that said mad scientist is responsible and romantic involved with his daughter, the mute servant, the stupid idiot cop and the stereotypical shotgun that handles the farmers who are always accused of being drunk. This was probably cliché even in 1942! The film moves at a slow pace and the director Newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the sense of emotion or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically, the film is not excellent, obviously the budget was minuscule and the monster itself looks lame, resembling an old homeless wino that has not shaved for a few weeks and has put a pair of plastic fangs on the mouth. Black and white cinematography is basic and static like most movies of this period, while Dr. Cameron's good laboratory consists of a sofa and a table with some pieces of scientific equipment on top. The performance is rigid and wooden, with Petro as if he was drugged throughout the film, Zucco as the mad scientist does not convince and is forgettable. The Mad Monster is a very boring horror movie, there is very little to entertain, although at least I managed to get to the end in a single session, which when I think about it is a great achievement in itself.
