This movie was offensive to PC, predictable and clich√©. I could not imagine a movie that best exemplifies the myopic and narcissistic preaching of today's Hollywood. If you have not seen it, do not bother looking at it. If so, show some courage and tell people how horrible it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the inherent and infinitely racist message of the film. This movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything, to add to any discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it is the kind of cheap and sensational shit that is promoted as deep and challenging thinking. In what kind of bubble do you have to live to think that this is awesome?
