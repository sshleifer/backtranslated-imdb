The history teacher, Mrs. Tingle, seems to have it in mind for the student Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart in getting a writing scholarship in school. She receives another low grade from Tingle, which does not help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the document of the final history exams and puts it in her purse, Mrs. Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three who will go to the director about it, but he is not available. So before she reports it to the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott go home that night and try to convince her not to tell the director. However, due to Tingle's stubbornness, they again took drastic measures to prevent this from coming out. <br /> <br /> I was not a fanatic when I first saw him, and after another remark, I'm still not one. . The writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after writing the successful contemporary horror films for teenagers; 'Scream (1996)', 'I know what you did last summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He was riding success (also not to forget the television show 'Dawson's Creek), but this project would be the final blow. The difference there, compared to this entry was something other than writing the script, it was also making its debut in the direction. The strange thing, however, was that I found that his address had to be performed competently, but the material he provoked was foolish and exhausted. He seemed to be caught playing a black comedy and a direct thriller, without causing it to gel. The script is full of sharpness, continuous gags, trivial sections and witty references to other films, but the problem is that it is too diluted with so many artificial developments and moral currents that interrupt the flow. The fractured script had to be stronger and more powerful, since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a theatrical show because of its mostly confined sets. Try playing mental games with the characters, but these moments are there only to serve the poor progression of the story in a pool of stupidity and lack of meaning. The end of the movie takes the cake. The polished direction of Williamson is good, but rather in a pedestrian way and, therefore, it lacks suspense and the rhythm, even with its tense surroundings, can really progress. Eventually you feel it after the halfway point, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are tolerable enough, but if it were not for Helen Mirren's elegant and icy portrait of manipulative skill like Mrs. Tingle and buoyant Marisa Coughlan, we would have been stuck watching Katie Holmes, a daring footwear addiction. Barry Watson is modest in his part of loafers and Molly Ringwald has a minor role. The soundtrack has enough energy, but I found it terribly overloaded and formless in its choices. <br /> <br /> It can be seen, but it is mechanical in every way.
