I sat through less painful operations than the time I spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you try to think it's going to be something in the vein of a Guy Ritchie movie ... Think again! The production, the dialogue, the acting, the script, the cinematographic work and the plot were the worst I've seen in a movie. My favorite part in all honesty were the final credits. In all the history of cinema, there has never been a better excuse to turn off the television and go out and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Do a root canal job instead of wasting your time and money!
