I wish I had read the comments in IMDb before watching this movie. The first hour was fine, although it made me wonder why everything was centered in Chicago and why nobody reported any weather anomaly from outside the United States. The isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the film continues as an endless story. The script is horrible. As for the actors, very bad choice. Only people hired to run in panic cling to their roles. But I have to agree that this movie has some good 'special effects'. If you rented it on a DVD and would like to see the film, despite the criticism, then pass it at the maximum speed your player allows!
