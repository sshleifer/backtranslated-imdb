First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors that appear in this film and, at the time I rented it, I wanted to like it. <br /> <br /> I think The main reason I was disappointed was that the outer box promised me a suspense thriller. In my opinion, a suspense thriller for British films is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has many dark twists and leaves the viewer with an ending that probably will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> This movie started with the promising note of being such a movie. We have our main character, who suspects a man he does not like, is involved in a coup and escape that killed the husband of one of his servants. His notions prove to be correct, but the idea that his wife could be involved. , it does not occur to her until she confesses that she was part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good suspense suspense were in place, at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost a kind of telenovela about who wants to be with whom and what is the love of a real relationship. The movie could have been nice to me, if the outer box had spoken of the triangle of a twisted lover and it would not have been described as a thriller of suspense. This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the initial setup seemed to be a slight distraction for the true content of the movie. I felt that this movie could have been much better than it did. I felt that I was still taking the viewer to a great event that never materialized. Therefore, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked and say that it did not meet my expectations.
