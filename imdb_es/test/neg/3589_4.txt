I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any case) it must be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. The Dominican Republic is not represented as it really is. In fact, I was surprised to see that the filming location of Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And, incredibly, the films with Cuban themes (La Habana, La ciudad perdida, Azúcar amargo, El Padrino II) were filmed in Santo Domingo! So, what happened here? Why did you film the film in Cuba instead of the D.R.? The Spanish dialogues with the Cuban accent are horrible! Those are not Dominicans! At the historical level, Galíndez would never have been hanged. He may also have been shot, beheaded or killed because of the inhuman torture he had been receiving. Then, he threw his body in the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by strangulation. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> Act is not delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he's waiting for a paycheck. I prefer the lead actress in "Deep Blue Sea." The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban film, and the same happens with the selected filming location. <br /> <br /> I suggest "The party of the goat", of the most sold The author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It is a bit more realistic with Dominican history. The character of Trujillo is very well represented, and the Galindez incident is briefly discussed in this film.
