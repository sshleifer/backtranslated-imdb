"Maduro" is one of those horrible indies that manage to go into circulation and give the indies a bad name. Tell a stupid incongruous story of twin pubescent girls who crawl out of a car accident that kills their parents and then go out on the street while they happily steal the store, look at some guy and end up in an Army post so dilapidated that no Army would do. I want it (yes, of course!). An apparent attempt at a mature film, "Maduro" is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly when players enter and leave the character and end awkwardly, with hardly any credibility. Not recommended for anyone.
