So many people loved this movie, however, there are some of the IMDb reviewers that we consider that Mirrormask is terribly uncomfortable to watch and that it is boring. I fall into the last of these two fields, and I will try to explain what caused my toenails to bend so unpleasantly. <br /> <br /> First, to clarify things: I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find his humor sarcastic, sarcastic and ironic, a little freaky, and actually I prefer his work when he interprets it directly and leaves jokes in peace, but, even with his occasional mistakes in shit "papa" gags, Find your creativity and imagination to be something a little special. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one of Gaiman's most powerful works is Coraline, a gothic fairy tale for children that has very few jokes and a lot of tension and chills. Her latest novel (Anansi Boys) exaggerates the fun, and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask inhabits a territory similar to that of Coraline, and when I saw the impressive images in the trailer, I was a little excited to see that someone had managed to transfer the spectacular vision and imagination of Gaiman to the screen. <br /> <br /> Praise of the Movie, some sequences look impressive. However, visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that resembles a student project of Media Studies. The backgrounds and the stage are usually amazing, but some of the animations of the characters are clumsy, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is very well animated, but the book-eating beast beast looks badly rendered and very "computer generated". Compared to the animation standard found in productions like 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask occasionally looks very fond. However, in Mirrormask's defense, the budget was small for such a grandiose vision, and some crunching of the effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can not be forgiven is the stagnant, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors are desperately struggling with dialogue, and there is so much of that that they are constantly being hampered and stumbling over it. The conversation becomes completely unnatural, the jokes are repeated again and again, and the turgid speeches seem to be the only method of exposing the plot of the writer. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace'), this makes the film almost impossible to see. In such an unreal environment, actors must work twice as hard to be believed, and in general they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role faces a brave fight against impossible dialogue on stage, and sometimes shows a real promise, but it's never enough. The dreadful god of cod "Oirish" Valentine's character (with whom he is forced to spend an inordinate amount of time on screen) pays any chance that this young actress rise above the material. It seems to be Valentine's job to explain the plot to the younger viewers and add a bit of light relief. Personally, I would not want it near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with this movie? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is annoying (for us, the British, anyway) is that Rob Brydon can act! We've seen him hold the screen for half an hour on his own (doing those 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and in the first part of the real world he's fine. However, stick it in front of a blue screen, it loses all sense of character and becomes the worst am-dram-jam I've seen in years. A real shame. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... the soundtrack of wanky slap-bassing, sub-Courtney Pine and unlistenable, too high in the mix that never stops. God, the music is incessant, noisy, distracted, irrelevant and, if that is not enough, has a wanky slap masturbates under everything. It makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but that could be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong with that? Answer .... The artist of the mime whistling. In modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every time the camera persists in the imbecile, the whistle, the juggling of moss, the weaving of yogurt, I understand why the locals in Edinburgh get a little anxious and upset when the Festival time comes. <br /> <br /> My final criticism Is that the movie is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring? Either he requires his audience to slide into a dream state, Zen, of acceptance, or that the audience is constantly captivated by bigger and bigger surprises. A story with a bit of rhythm with characters that we could believe in and worry about would have come a long way to give this film the emotional center it sadly lacked, while preventing the eyelids from falling. <br /> <br /> Finally, apologize to all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this movie. You have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have seen beyond the squeaking CGI, ignored the horrible dialogue and the abysmal results that resulted, and you understood the great and imaginative vision of the creator. He wanted to, but he could not see beyond the faults of the real world that dragged him down. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman does well the next time, if he (or even wants) the opportunity.
