Bad, environmental sound. A lot of shuffles. Loooong meaningless scenes. Ex: boy sees interesting woman in the lobby. He manages to stay there and look at her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package. Do not say anything. Creepy looks. More shuffles and other irritating environmental noises. I waited. I waited. I waited. Guy does not say anything. The woman seems scared or, at least, a little annoyed about it, and rightly so. Manager returns with the package. Guy goes up to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the boy and his host sit down to watch television. More environmental noise and shuffling. Wait wait wait wait wait The boy goes to bed. If you can stop to see more of this movie, you can watch them watch TV later. <br /> <br /> Whether you want a story, a dialogue, entertainment or a well-crafted film, look elsewhere.
