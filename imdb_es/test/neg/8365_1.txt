If you come to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you will not learn anything except how not to write a script on the subject. I understand that the intention was to show how a severe depression can turn an average person into a complete disaster, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've seen in a Hollywood movie ... no small thing. Christina Ricci while Elizabeth spends the entirety of this movie screaming at the top of her lungs, brutally insulting someone, breaking down in tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions are a bit of a bad mood at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest hint of how it could be SIN WITHOUT depression ... not the slightest hint of any other aspect of her personality ... she just screams. At one point, her roommate says, "Lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "She IS?" It seemed strange that the writers included this comment without giving us any example, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no discernible structure or flow at all; instead, it consists of a series of crooked scenes of Lizzie that end uncomfortably. Character development? No ... Scenes of your daily existence, that is, going to classes, could they be important details? No ... screaming at the maximum volume? CHECK. It's not enough, I'm afraid. 1/10.
