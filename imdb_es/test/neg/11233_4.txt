This movie is full of sentimentality, unprofessional flights that make a pilot like me tremble and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for example? She has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, except to allow her "Follow Me" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has to be one of the most stupendous sequences of the movie. Another is at the end when the plane (was it a B-26 or an A-26? - both designations are used in the film) is left with the accessories spinning and without chocks in place. That serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a feared spoiler. As it is, the plane would have begun to roll without control. The ending (once again, avoiding spoilers) involves too much conversation, as at the beginning of the sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss just babbles again and again. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of the plane's protocol and a couple of improbabilities / impossibilities that I will not describe. What a boring and disjointed effort!
