No no no no no NO NO! This is not a movie, it's an excuse to show people dancing. This is simply not good. Even the dance is slow and not as entertaining as the mediocre 'Dirty Dancing', let alone any other good dance movie. <br /> <br /> Is it a love story? It is a musical? It's a drama? It's a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of everything, it's that this film fails in everything it tries to be. The movie becomes even more meaningless as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible from all angles, the script is definitely trying to tell us something about the relationship, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> SEE THE MOMENT: when Patrick Stewart comes on the scene and thinks that the film could improve as it illuminates the opaque atmosphere. For one second.
