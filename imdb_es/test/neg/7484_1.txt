It is not often that I feel strong enough to publish something about a movie. This was, however, just the worst movie I've seen. The performances were laughable at best, in the worst case they were, well, there is no other word to say, horrible. Especially the main woman who has a random sexual behavior, you have to see her and listen to her to believe her. Honestly, the plot is absurd, the atrocious dialogue and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not a Alan Smithee movie. I can not emphasize this enough ... avoid it at all costs. How are movies made like this? This is not a low budget movie at its worst.
