I saw this movie about 8 years ago, when it first came out, and the only memories I have about it are: 1. It was horrible. 2. That in one scene, Linnea Quigley applies a tanning lotion on her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes in a row (anyway, it seems to be longer). 3. A scene in which a character receives a hammer rammed into his head. In this scene, when the hammer is connected, the head breaks like a crystal. It is too bad
