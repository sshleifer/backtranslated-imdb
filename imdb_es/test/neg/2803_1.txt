Rent this one movie if you feel like laughing (out of sheer stupidity), as this movie will not scare a group of kindergarteners at a Halloween party! The problem is that there is too much blood for the children, so definitely do not put this in your VCR for young children. Start with a bit of promise, giving you the impression that the artist on the cover of the box may have started watching this movie before designing the cover, but then quickly descends into epic stupidity. The "murderous scarecrows" are clumsy awkward people who are as fearful as the Wizard of Oz, but not so intelligent. If only they had a brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / closing store and, even so, I feel somewhat cheated. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you really pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
