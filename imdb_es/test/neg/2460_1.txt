A group of yuppies of medical students gather in their spare time to connect with each other to the electrical wires and die. Then they remain standing counting the time before brain death, and then they begin CPR and massage the heart and return to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie should say it all. FLATLINERS is like a GHOST group. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their dead old friends, so what better way to do that than a group of medical students kill you for five minutes and then give you back your life? The rest of the film has the predictable relationship problems, plus the predictable "MAY IT BE IF WE KEEP KILLING OTHERS, ONE OF THESE DAYS, WILL ONE OF THESE BE DEAD?" D'OH !!! This movie should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were represented as medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign Correspondence School to get their degrees. The only thing that prevented this movie from being a total laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers in the sockets to "die". This movie would have been a great comedy film by THREE BLAMES.
