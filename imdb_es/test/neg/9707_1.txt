If you've never heard of Jane Austen, have seen the original film or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or have even seen an emerging version of the book, this ridiculous attempt to show this classic love story can be considered vaguely bearable. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, this film should be remembered for its horrible performance, its poor presentation and the complete lack of Jane Austen's classic wit. <br /> <br /> Whoever has chosen actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench, who obviously has never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read it, should be punished!) Keira Knightley grimaces and she smiles through every scene, and she was so hateful that no one would want to marry her.Darcy looked like she was trying to remember her lines throughout the whole movie and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack to portray his characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> This version could not see the pride and prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, to who cared if they had met or not ... Absolutely abysmal, even the few minutes of Judi Dench can not save this crap ... I can not think of anything good to say about this movie, other than that it finally ended!
