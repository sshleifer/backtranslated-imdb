I had no idea that this movie was produced by "WWE". The fight is pretty loose. Why did they have to mess up his name more by making a movie as horrible as this one? I thought it was a total disappointment. If I had known that this movie was going to be as stupid as it was, I would have stayed at home and done something more entertaining. Of course, I'll give you credit for the great effects; but the killer did not seem as scary as it could have been. He was missing a series of things. But I will let you point them out for yourselves. The plot was a great idea, it could only have been done in a much better way. Perhaps in the future, WWE will maintain its moronic struggle and remain outside the film industry.
