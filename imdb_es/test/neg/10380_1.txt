While this film had some moments of fear (great use of music and the angles of the film to create suspense), it is obvious that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy did not waste time investigating the subject; which also makes me question his claim that the scenes of exorcism were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many inconsistencies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob, the Roman Catholic priest, when he first met with him outside the church, wore an academic robe over his clerics instead of the typical alba, chasuble or surplus. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not by Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Priest Jacob quotes some dark and disturbing scriptures about the angels who take up arms. He attributes it to Saint Paul. This verse is not from the writings of St. Paul, nor is it in the Bible. I can not even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in the possession of demons and rejects the request to study exorcism, but makes a total of 180 (later that day?) a few minutes of talking to the possessed Isabelle. Of course, it is possible; But a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as priest / psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a more realistic representation of a skeptic turned believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest turned peasant, is the first to attempt an exorcism with Isabelle. He quotes the scriptures, and she quotes again. He says: "I see you know Psalm 65", she corrects him "that is Psalm 67", both are wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the ex-priest who has just performed an exorcism: making the sign of the cross, invoking the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc., tells Jacob that he does not believe in the church and he does not believe in god (maybe he's just in conflict?) Jacob asks him to put on his homemade clothes and have another chance anyway. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former catholic Catholic priest, crosses back (or Eastern Orthodox style). As a Roman Catholic Hispanic who used to be a priest, he should have crossed over from front to sternum, from the left side to the right side of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read the little side stories to get the notion that Satan was playing with the whole family, not just with Isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if someone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all a demonic deception (except for the sheriff, it's pretty clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion, she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a parody. <br /> <br /> Listening to the ongoing comment with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I am inclined to believe that it was a joke.
