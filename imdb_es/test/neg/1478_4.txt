Once again, I seem to be the only person on planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fires on the Plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of "classics" that receives all kind of compliments For no apparent good reason. As much as I like to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all these viewers who have such a horrible taste in the film, it is still almost impossible to rationalize why someone would think that a shag as badly made as this should be proclaimed as a "masterpiece". What I find really ironic is that fans of the "classics" derived as "Fires on the Plain" focus so much on the creation of films "inside the box" (orthodox rating standards such as script writing, acting, work of camera, etc.) It always seems that the most venerated "classics" are the most deficient in these same standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves a forced verbal exposition where the characters basically explain everything to the viewer, even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. The most surprising thing is that the first scene of "Fires on the Plain" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. <br /> <br /> After a funny slap, the next pointless dialogue assaults the viewer, "Why can not you? Do we capture the situation?" We landed in the west with heavy fire to reinforce units in Tacloban. Our men, our artillery went down in transit, we tried to get to the Burauen airfield crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible, the enemy counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. So, why, exactly, does a character tell another character something he already knows? Oh yes, it's true, the creators of this movie are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality movie would actually show that these events are happening, or in the worst case it would involve a dialogue involving a character who has no knowledge of those events. Hell, even an opening summary in the form of a paragraph addressed to the viewer would have been better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> Such examples of shoddy films are filled with "Fires on the Plain" to the point where this movie looks like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the main character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in a Japanese outfit. Instead of doing the natural thing like ?? oh I do not know? Giving a depressed mannerism, the character releases "Japanese soldiers". Thank you friend, but I could have imagined it for myself. <br /> <br /> What's worse, this movie is saturated with dramatic stratagems. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Imagine this. A soldier walks and finds a pair of worn boots. One might think that such a find is completely useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his worn SUPER boots behind. Well, I understand the point. The soldiers are in bad shape? a fact that is already clearly emphasized with your worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the SECOND soldier arrives! See, do you find the boots and warnings SUPER worn from the previous soldier? get ready, why come here? that his boots are super-dull boots worn! Lucky man, he takes the SUPER used boots and leaves his used SUPER DUPER boots. But you see, that's not all? Because the THIRD soldier arrives then! Find the worn SUPER DUPER boots of the previous soldiers and inspect them, along with their own SUPER DUPER worn boots. As both partners suck, he tosses them aside and smiles while still barefoot. At this point, I was ready to throw my TV through the window of my living room. The heavy hand, the excessive drama and the supreme absurdity of this sequence go beyond a bad cinematographic realization. It's a bad SUPER DUPER movie. <br /> <br /> There are a series of similar moments, completely stupid. Like when the main character asks someone: "Hey, are you dead?" Like the boy will answer "Yes" if he really kicks the cube. I will also be the first to condemn the mediocre performance of the main actor, which is the quintessential poster of the artificial reaction. I laughed loudly during the opening of the slap in the head, where his head slides into place with this stupid and silly expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The fact that this trivial piece of fluff gets an average score of 8.4 of IMDb while a certifiable A masterpiece like "A tale of two sisters" (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of massive stupidity. And to think that some people really deceive themselves thinking that "ATTENTION" does not make sense. Well, not all movies can have completely extravagant SUPER DUPER boots on their side.
