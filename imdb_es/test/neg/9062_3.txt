I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it was not very motivating, and they did not even address the idea of ​​what a training program would be like, so non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take to train and run one. In fact, there was almost zero technical information at all. I did not expect this to be a high-tech instructional video, but when the information was close to zero, then the movie was simply not balanced, and it was not particularly useful for non-marathoners contemplating their first race. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the first images were people who collapsed near death while trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. The timing was also difficult to follow, because it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you good clues about the time you were watching. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume it's all over his training, but then, several scenes later, you get an idea that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard. <br /> <br /> Some however, the parts were very good, like the part of a woman who challenges the race officials who wanted the race to be only for men, and the coverage of a race in Chicago where two of the runners portrayed previously competed for the first place. <br /> <br /> From the top of my head, I'm thinking of other chronological documentaries, like Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and feel like they told you everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> In summary, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon film, and as it is, I can not recommend this to non-marathoners to educate them and motivate them to try one, because I do not. I think it will have that effect.
