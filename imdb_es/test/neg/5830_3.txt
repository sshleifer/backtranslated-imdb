Final draft: a screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) is locked in his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a script of terror. It is not a terrible premise, but the execution is horrible. This feels like a first year of directing and writing work, and probably is. The director jumps to the shit of everything. It is meant to be disorienting. What it is is annoying. So much so that small pieces of film are incoherent. The writing is predictable, and is not used to follow most of the ideas it offers (orange bag). It's as if they've run out of time and been slapped for the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not amazing "oh, my God, it's so bad it's good" bad. It's boring, and it irritates you for a long time afterwards. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor, and keeps the boat just above the water. But it's too normal for the kind of psychosis that the movie tries to offer. He's just a withdrawn guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, and then decides to act slightly deranged. The cause follows the effect. Maybe there is something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares the image of Chris O'Donald and is even more upset, a superhuman achievement. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere provided by the film is good (dark gray and grim), but since it is the only thing that the film achieves, it does not mean anything. This movie wants to be Jacob's Ladder or The Machinist. It's not even Secret Window. She is the preppy girl of the class who decides to become gothic. <br /> <br /> It's not terribly terrible, but the stupidity of that will go to you. I have already thought more about this criticism of what the filmmakers did for this. <br /> <br /> D
