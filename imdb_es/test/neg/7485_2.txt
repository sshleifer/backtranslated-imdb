The Wife of Jon Good (just one of the worst titles in a movie), or The Red Right Hand (another title that sounds absolutely horrible and that means nothing and has no relevance to the film) under which I saw it, is in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' (incidentally the year I was born, which was possibly the best thing that happened during those 365 days) where five old friends from the university meet for a school reunion, the gay fag Roger Mather (John Kuntz, is the surname for Solo say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) besides John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling of 'John' different in the title?) And his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the beginning, there is an uncomfortable tension in the air and when someone mentions his "disappeared" friend Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories are flooded again. Then come the phone calls, the mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt as the true horror of the events of so many years that finally comes to light ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executive produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the thing and Kurt St. Thomas, who also gets credit for art direction and, if that was not enough, both act in the film too! Personally I thought Jon Good's wife was horrible, I mean she can not cook or anything. Ha ha ha, just kidding! Seriously, although I did not think much about the film in general, to begin with it is quite slow and the first 30 full minutes are solid material of repetition of the meeting that consists of catching up and in an exhibition of construction of boring characters. The film never explains itself, what about those strange nosebleeds for the love of God, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural and what the hell was Sara? ? She presents herself as a meddlesome, crazed, dirty, shameless and blackmailer prostitute who apparently sleeps with almost every man she knows! Part of the dialogue she talks about would not be out of place in a porn movie and seems to be totally at odds with the rest of the movie that resembles more of a drama than the horror / thriller it was supposed to be. Then there is the end, if there is a worse way to finish a movie, just leave everything literally in the air without any kind of closure that you have not seen yet. Everything was very predictable too, I mean if someone who is watching this is not going to know that when everyone mentions that their friend Calef "disappeared", would not there be more? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas makes an exasperating movie, in addition to the predictability and the annoying climax, there is a retrospective narrative from Alan that I just do not understand, since it has more or less importance than any other person and at what moment of time does it narrate? The reasons behind this narration are never clarified or developed. There is no tension because everything is so good because of the numbers. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is fine, but it's nothing special and some of the locations and the clothes did not seem particularly authentic, this never convinced me. It took place in the late 70's. The performance was good and what about the last name of actor John Kuntz? I suppose if his wife were standing next to him, we could describe them as a pair of Kuntz, right ?! <br /> <br /> I really did not think much about Jon Good's Wife (an inflatable doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) and I'm not sure who I would turn to. Forget about any gore, horror, violence, fear, environment or emotion, in fact, forget about everything that would have made this film visible because it is not here. Not recommended.
