SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was rented as a joke, and it was a joke. The movie is based on a dog hunter looking for El Chupacabra. The attire of dog hunters is so ridiculous. It seems that he sewed the patch on his hat and, for some reason, shows off his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the film, mainly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a car that is very bright and they drive in a black tone. You can often see the shadow of the camera man on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible, and the acting is terrible. This is a good movie to laugh ... maybe.
