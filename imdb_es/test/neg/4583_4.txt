But just like the Disney film two generations ago, this film also fails in the precision department. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is real story a bit mundane for movie producers? I do not think so. There is ample documentation to accurately represent the real story instead of the fictitious accounts that we have had to suffer. <br /> <br /> Someday, a movie will correctly portray Bobby's owner, John Gray, as the Edinburgh policeman he was, and correctly represent Bobby's license that Mr. Provost√≠ paid. When that happens, I'll be at the theaters.
