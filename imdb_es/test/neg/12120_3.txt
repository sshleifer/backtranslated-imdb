Most of the positive comments posted here are as detailed as the movie! It takes a long breath to appreciate a tedious and boring movie, it's supposed. Some have simply called the film "contemplative", which means that it is slow and without plot, however, a Dutch critic hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a boring movie whose tone is in the first scene. Here, a real estate agent is showing an apartment to a young couple who, as expected, talks nonstop and no matter what is happening. The same goes for almost all the other characters! <br /> <br /> The only silences in this image are the sequences of dreams, fragments of 1930 Soviet propaganda, and they are also its most interesting parts. This tells you something about what you can see the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The shooting device of most extreme close-up scenes, as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds, ages rapidly.
