First of all, I just want to say that this program could have worked well, much better than what it is doing now. What knocked him down was definitely the performance. Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as Carly's main character, seemed almost worthy of her own show when she was in Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Miranda not only can not act convincingly enough, but she is also incredibly stiff when she moves. It seems as if she was not sure how the "carly" character would move or stop. In the first episode at the end, when she raises her hat, her arm never moves away from her elbow. Even when I was dancing it looked like a stick in the breeze. And he sing? The song was great, just because Drake had been there, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded false. I must admit that the plot and the settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's Nick. They are practically known for their stupid lines and characters. But wow, it's iCarly the worst of all.
