As a professional poker dealer for more than 25 years, I found it very difficult to watch this movie. Too unreal It seems that the producers of this film either did little or no research or simply did not care. Card tricks are something you would never see in a real poker game. The correct common sense? It was also full of movie clippings and so on during the tricks. Who could not do that? The deception was something amateurish. Palming, marked cards, etc. Do you sit in a high-limit game where you use open deck cards? Do you feel in a game where players push their chips in the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them and then just verbalizing how much they bet? WE GO ! I gave him a 4 because the twists and turns may be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game it will be very painful. Next time they should use real players and get an idea of ​​how to do it right. OH!!!
