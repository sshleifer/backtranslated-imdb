There is something strange about the antisocial feeling that you can find in the Cheech And Chong material. One of Up In Smoke's songs, well, I would often like more songs to start like that. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo shows us the videos of four songs from their current album, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You listen to a voice-over during the opening credits in which an anonymous producer describes the album as a novel recording that will only occupy space in the lists. Unfortunately, this opening of the voice-over hits the nail in the head. <br /> <br /> Most of the music recordings supported by the RIAA seem to maintain the rule of putting the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when one passes the first song, the discerning listener realizes that the recording has little or nothing to get his attention. Bands that defied conventional convention, on the other hand, often kept their best material for the end, or at least spread it evenly throughout the record. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to cover their bets. The first piece, Get Out Of My Room, is a song with a hilarious theme and an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a music video from the 80s will find the address somewhat careless nostalgic. Cheech's conception of British punk is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Where everything goes downhill is the second number, I'm not home right now. Nothing kills interest in a song like repetition, and it's hard to do more repetitive than this auditory song. Honestly, you feel the need to slap Cheech and tell him we have the idea, he's not home right now, so continue. The next song, along with the theme that love is a strange thing, is the absolute rock background, not only for this collection, but for Cheech and Chong in general. It's almost as if this song had been created for the sole reason of completing the album's run time. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the stoner duo kept the best for last, but it is also curious to note that Chong is completely absent from this cut. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based on the old Bruce Springsteen number that mocks Reagan's vision of multiculturalism. As one delights in Cheech's story, one wonders how many poor athletes who could not speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not white. Racism was an integral part of the culture of the United States in 1985, and continues to be so today. In any case, it has gotten worse, so one has to wonder what Born In East LA would be like if it were written in the current era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two cuts are not made in an album, especially when there is so much dull stuffing between them. The interviews before leaving my room, for example, are quite fun. Not aside as much from Up In Smoke, but funny enough to justify its existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their recordings. Bored song makes boring stuffing. If you eliminate the half hour average of material of this video, you would have something substantially better. <br /> <br /> I gave Get Out Of My Room a three out of ten. You win with the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they thought.
