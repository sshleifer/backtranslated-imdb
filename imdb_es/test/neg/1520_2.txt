Being a HUGE fan of the final series, I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I waited anxiously for a laugh in a minute on a roller coaster ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Where to go Start in this mess? I think it's a good start to say that it's hard for Richie and Eddie to appear on our screens in the first place, since none of the jokes or the liners that they deliver so well are fun. I was still waiting for the first laugh. after a good 20 minutes of viewing. Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the movie was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out the final cut. <br /> <br /> The general The scenarios and the atmosphere that surrounds the film are dark and dismal, which I suppose is good if they want to portray the "terrible" guest house that the 2 jesters try to run, but for me it is an even greater obstacle in an unfortunate state of filming. It should never have been created. <br /> <br /> The acting, sometimes, is pathetic. Fenella Fielding is wasted like crazy Mrs. F Oxfur and I have seen Simon Pegg have much better outings. <br /> <br /> I would recommend the Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is blind and drunk because they could appreciate the terrible puns much more. But to any background fan who has not seen this movie and waits for a real richie and eddie action that has been warned
