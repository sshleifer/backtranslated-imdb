As mentioned earlier in other comments, the NVA's main problem is that it can not decide what it wants to be, a slapstick of the cheaper type or an honest parody of the East German Army. There are a couple of moments that are quite touching, for example, when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in Schwedt with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann bets on children's humor. It is not surprising that the film failed at the German box office, since historically it is not true to the real situation in those training camps and is directed by an actor who, unfortunately, is unable to offer nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> However, there is the camera work of Frank Griebe who, as always, does a wonderful job. If it were not for its beautiful images, I would have rated the movie much worse.
