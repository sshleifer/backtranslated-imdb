This was probably thought of as an "artistic" crime thriller, but it fails in both senses: there are few emotions and there is not enough substance. The slow pace makes it difficult to sit down, and the occasional action scenes are edited with too much difficulty and are organized in a confusing manner to offer great compensation. At least the level of action is high. (**)
