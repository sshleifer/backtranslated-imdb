This season was not very successful, but when it comes to preparing stories so that we can be in a good mood again, Season 6 has no highlights or spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season lacked your usual Sopranos style, and if you cut it with all the garbage that was filled in every episode this season, you would probably have had 6 episodes of real stories. <br /> <br /> Parallel stories like Pauly's mother, is she or not? It was boring and had no purpose other than exploring his character. I would have liked to have seen Bobby express his anger more with Pauly in that episode of the carnival, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These secondary stories had no real purpose, and they lack endings. If you are going to finish these stories in the next 6 episodes, I would prefer not to see them, because they really are not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice word to say about this season. and its end.
