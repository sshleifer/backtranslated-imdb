This movie is a waste of time. Although he has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the film is unsatisfactory and has a clich√© point. "You never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." That phrase prevents you from losing hours of your life in this movie. The people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before discovering that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the movie is not even going to happen, at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivate. There is a reason why this project did not make a theatrical premiere, and although indy movies can be very good, it does not even come close.
