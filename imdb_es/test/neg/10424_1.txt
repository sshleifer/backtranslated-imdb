This could have been a good biopic, but what a disaster! I had this movie when I was a theater manager. When I put together the movie and saw it, I thought I had some reels out of order. In the end it turned out that no, and if he did, no one would have noticed. I could not understand what is happening! Everyone who came out practically felt the same!
