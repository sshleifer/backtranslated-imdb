In the mid-1970s, my apartment in New York. The building was finally connected to cable television and, as Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel that was offered to show recent films, I signed up for it. As a writer and nocturnal by nature, I soon discovered that the channel showed movies late at night and into the wee hours of the morning that I had never heard of, most of them American independent films and foreign films that have never been given an American theatrical premiere. Many of them had recognizable "star" models and respectable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered that many first-rate movies that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had the opportunity to see. Most of these cinematic mestizos were, in effect, "dogs," but they were often so bad that, unintentionally, they were fun. One night, Showtime unveiled a small Italian-made gem called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, given a limited European release in 1973). Although the film had never been released in the USA. UU., The classification of the MPAA was listed as an 'R'. Since the director was Sylvio Narizzano (the director who became famous with the glorious "Georgy Girl"), and the three protagonists were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try it. And I found myself stuck on my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the former a crazy maniac who, in a scene that turned his stomach, casually sent a German family to his death by pushing his trailer from a cliff, sinking into the depths of the desert. Until now, so bad. Then, out of nowhere, they see Testi (as the "good" psychopath) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was made), both naked, in a men's room, Testi sneaking into the boy's body while shaving , and poor Lester confused was fixed on the close-ups of Testi's naked butt. As a member of the film industry who is not yet tired, and as a liberal of playing cards (I was so against censorship nowadays), the whole movie made me dizzy (and, being in the early 70's when I thought that I had seen it all in the "anything goes" movies of that liberated era, including the uncut version of "That cold day in the park" by Altman, a real astonishment until it was cut to get a rating of "R" And the end of Altman's career, if he had not found something called "M * A * S * H", I still wonder if anyone else, except for me, saw "Redneck" and I was horrified. Destroying the actors and the audience that goes to the movies is a joy that misfit filmmakers have been happily indulging since the beginning of time, but happily exploiting a well-respected and talented children's actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when that was beginning to realize the difficult transaction from infant to adult actor (and I am sure that his cinematographic offers had been reduced to become unhealthy garbage like "Redneck") ... Sir. Narizzano, you should be crouching your head in shame. (By the way, I soon became friends with the actors that had appeared in Narizzano's future, undistinguished efforts, both despised him.
