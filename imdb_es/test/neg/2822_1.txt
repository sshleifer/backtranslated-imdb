Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll is undoubtedly the worst product of Western civilization. Monologues are not interesting nor do they make sense. In the rare monologue that captures the attention of the audience, it is quickly lost through excessively long repetitions and unnecessary additions (The Hells Angels in McDonalds come to mind). I think Bogosian's only show needed filler material to give length that he thought justified the price of admission. <br /> <br /> I'd rather sleep with my aunt and stay hanging upside down and drained of my blood than go back to see Sex, drugs, rock & roll.
