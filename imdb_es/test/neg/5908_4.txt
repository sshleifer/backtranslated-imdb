Eddie Murphy put a lot into this movie. He directed, starred and produced this story about two nightclub owners in the 30s who try to fight against mobsters and corrupt policemen by taking over their club. A great cast in Murphy Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor, Danny Aiello, Della Reese and a beautiful Jasmine Guy that would make him worth seeing on his own ... but the story simply does not show interest or offer the great cast enough to work with ... on a scale of one to ten ... to 4
