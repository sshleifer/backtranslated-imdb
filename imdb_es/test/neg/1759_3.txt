The first 90 minutes of this movie seemed very interesting to me, although some parts were ridiculous (that is, the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed. <br /> <br /> The film is very well represented and I can see why Rene Zellweger won an Academy Award since his character was very interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is very emotional. However, the message seemed bad to me: it does not surprise me these days in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) leaves the Confederate army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him at home. He is also disillusioned with the war. (Can you imagine if each soldier in a similar boat would desert the army in the two world wars?) <br /> <br /> However, in this film, of course, all that is perfectly acceptable. So, what is it that the liberal filmmaker has had something good to say about the US military? To increase their inclination to the left, they represent a vigilante gang that chases the deserters like cold-blooded assassins. Well, in the world of movies, as we know: the good is described as bad and the bad is good ... and only the liberals would portray the deserters as heroes.
