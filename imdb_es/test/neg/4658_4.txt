I must say that I had few expectations for the film before I saw it. Everyone around me said it was great, but I knew exactly what they liked. They like the Aerosmith song, which is really great, they like the amazing special effects that they've eaten a lot, they like the comic side of the movie and, of course, many girls who love Affleck that, according to me opinion, is a really bad actor who did not try. be one, failed and now it is nothing. And all these things, plus the reviews and ratings I read on the internet, gave me a hint that the movie would be a big disappointment, since I'm a movie fan. Well, I was right, but at least I was ready. <br /> <br /> The movie is really commercial. It has been said, but I will say it like again. We have a budget of more than 100 million dollars, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular for the fact that they rarely agree to become part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names are not written in large letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are very respected actors that I also like a lot. They could play many characters in different types of movies. They could improvise, they could turn bad taste lines into hilarious jokes. In general, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic movies, people love and will always love. Like Fargo in the case of Buscemi or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed that they participated in Armageddon. Thornton plays an intelligent and refined man involved in politics, if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep-core drilling team that is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to disappear the world. <br /> <br /> What I did not like, well, I suppose I have already been understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is boring, naive and silly. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that is ridiculous. At least, films like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered art. At least it is not so obvious that the film is made for financial purposes. Apart from that, bad performances from all the big stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and, sometimes, they do not make any sense. In fact, I recently read that on stage, Ben Affleck asked Bay if it would be easier if they taught the astronauts to drill, that the drillers become astronauts and Bay's answer was simply "Shut up!" which is a very funny story that perfectly shows the desperation of the creators. <br /> <br /> And enclosing, I will give an explanation of why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like "I do not want to miss a thing" and I was impressed by the special effects that are obviously the only good thing about the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 good things that I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon, which was, is and always will be a bad big movie.
