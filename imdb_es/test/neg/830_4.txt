Even before this movie, it is clear that Ali G has become the exact character that he intended to parody. Anyway, I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character, but I was curious to see how a man with so little talent could convince the universal studios to finance a 1.5-hour film of a 3-minute joke. <br /> <br /> A paper-thin plot is just a torrent of jokes about penis and marijuana and I must admit that I shuddered when I saw such respected people as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, who were leaning too much for getting a job. By saying that I must admit (although I'm ashamed) that I had more than one occasion, and however bad this movie was, it was never boring, and I never considered turning it off (mainly because of the beautiful Rhona Mitra). That said, just watch this movie if you're a teenager between 14 and 17 years old and find funny jokes.
