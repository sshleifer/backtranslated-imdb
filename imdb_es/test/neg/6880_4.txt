I would not call this exactly a good movie, in fact it could be a bad one. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least 2 good reasons to continue watching this movie, those are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric) to whom both provide solid performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the cast, which are pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in the HAVOC drama of "Suburban children go to the chapel", but here it is far from being annoying. <br /> <br /> THE HISTORY is decent enough though nothing special, BUT it would have been much better, since in LOUSIANNA it happens that any of the children incorporated a southern accent, but not (!). <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie where "the monster" is actually delimited so deeply in the popular tradition of Lousianna, with voodoo and that's why it's simply stupid not to include that accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only w ho is rapper METHOD MAN, he plays deputy Turner and puts quite a good accent on his few scenes, and I mean if a rapper is able to do this, why "Professional" actors can not do the same? same? Mister Tical, aka Meth, is very nice in his very small role. Who knows if the Ticallion stallion would be a policeman? Even if only on the big screen. <br /> <br /> On top of that, it's a pretty stupid but rather nice Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the youngsters, this could have been really bad, fortunately they're good as habit. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent BUT there are hundreds of better Slasher movies out there.
