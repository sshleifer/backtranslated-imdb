Chuck Norris plays Danny, a cop who shot down a huge serial killer. However, when the killer escapes, Danny knows that he is the only one capable of stopping terror. However, Danny keeps a secret, he knows it was pure luck that stopped the terror and even more luck that Danny survived, now a final battle is fought, but is Danny ready? Right there in my description says what is the problem with this movie. Norris is playing a weak hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great thriller. In the hands of a Norris thriller, it makes him ridiculous and hopeless anti-hero. Also on board is Steve James, of American Ninja, and Ron O'Neal of Superfly, but any attempt to develop the character is defeated by the atrocious script. There is also almost no action and I always preferred a Norris movie with more fights and less chats. Given the qualification on this website, I should not be alone. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (incorrect)
