"The Man From Utah" opens with a cowboy singer playing a guitar on horseback. This is how we introduced ourselves to John Weston (John Wayne), we went to the city and we looked for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George, pre-Gabby Hayes) to thwart a bank robbery with his elegant shooting, the marshal offers him a covert job as an agent to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the grand prize money at the rodeo are a tight-knit band of bad guys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also heads the rodeo committee. Serious challengers to the supremacy of Barton's best trusted man, Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) end up seriously ill or dead. <br /> <br /> Even in this decade of 1930, Lone Star Westerns John Wayne had a charismatic presence that hinted at a future star quality. If for nothing else, seeing Wayne so young in these movies is a real pleasure. The film itself runs at a rapid pace of fifty-three minutes, much of which is occupied by the archival footage of ropes, bulldogging and Indian parades and dances. In the decisive rodeo event, Weston avoids the disaster by discovering a poisoned needle that is inserted in the chair of "Dynamite", a bronco that previously had not been evaluated and that must surpass Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The end is not a surprise, as Barton's bad guys give up winning the rodeo events and keep the prize money pot deposited in the local bank. But Marshal and Weston are there to thwart their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen before in movies like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", the character of Wayne closes the film in a meeting with a beautiful girl, this time the daughter of Judge Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young) , who leaned for him throughout the film.
