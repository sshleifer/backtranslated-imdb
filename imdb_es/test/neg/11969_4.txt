"Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's the death of the game!" Do I need to say more? Scarecrow Go Wild won four out of ten stars for one simple reason: apart from the terrible performance, the plot holes, the cheap special effects and the anti-climatic whistles, it was cinematic gold! I think this movie could have been really good, if the scarecrow had turned out to be the baseball coach (as the always brilliant Ken Shamrock portrayed it). But, again, they would have had to cut off those AWESOME special effects of electricity "Return of the Jedi". <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, my friends and I were convinced that, in fact, it was written by one of our friends, a stereotyped teenage boy. This movie has topless women, gorillas, and a dialogue that could not have come from a paper bag, or in this case, a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker one thing, it would be this "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote this for you?"
