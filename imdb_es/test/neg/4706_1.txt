Well, Dude Where's My Car could be at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood movies that seems to have been written, broadcast, filmed and edited in less than a day. Honestly, I can not believe that this was done (or that I allowed my friends to make me go through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "dumb", and the actors involved do not seem to be able to perform any kind of humor if the script had provided it. Oddly enough, unlike most slapstick comedies without meaning, this movie actually has a lot of argument: every scene seems to present a new uninteresting and uninteresting secondary plot. Of course, they were obviously fools, but it does not work on any level ... There is only one aspect of this movie that I enjoyed: Donkeylips from the old Nickalodean show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will make you the next Richard Gere, however, you only look ...
