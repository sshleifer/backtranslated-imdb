I just finished watching this movie, and for me ... it takes a long time to finish because it's so boring ... and the story is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> now ... where I should start ... Or ... the movie is called "sinking of Japan" ... yes, yes ... it shows that Japan is really sinking but the part of action is very bad. Compared to the movie "the day after tomorrow", he would have qualified at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "sinking of Japan" does not show much about the disaster that really happened right in front of our eyes there's not much enthusiasm ... boring ... all I can say ... < br /> <br /> one more point ... I would recommend this film to have a better title ... maybe something like "the romance of the sinking of Japan" because this movie has many conversations (waste of time ... no sense) and the love story is extremely boring and I've been dragging too long ... honestly ... I almost get frustrated. <br /> <br /> In general ... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters, for example many people running like hell to avoid death ... the part of the love story was not moving enough for me. <br /> <br /> but hey ... there's one thing we should appreciate about this movie ... & It has good songs!
