This movie is based on the Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! It is placed on a different stage from Streetfighter: the animated movie! This movie has to do with Ryu, who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! No other character in the game was used (I discovered)! The fight scenes were fine, but nothing really spectacular! And there were not many of them! For me this is strange! Streetfighter is not about fighting! Streetfighter the animated movie (1994) is far superior to this movie. Try to be more than what it really is! The use of "Fairy Power" and other supernatural elements have nothing to do with the abilities that the characters have in the game! And in this case that is a bad thing! The story is so boring that you really do not care what is happening! The action is considerably attenuated! Why? And what happened to the other characters in the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special abilities. In this movie it's about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
