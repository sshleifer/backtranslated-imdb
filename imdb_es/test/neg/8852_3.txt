I was so excited to finally see "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say that it disappointed me completely. Maybe I think he was too excited. He had expectations set by his fans that simply could not be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew that this would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, painful. I'm a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal and bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I love the constant and growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". The "pulse" offered little of any spectrum, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Along with the slowness of the plot, it was also very confusing. I had no idea why the characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help solve their problem. It seemed as if the director had left the plot in one or two sentences and the rest had not been played by our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a fairly difficult plot to follow, "Pulse" clears up very little at the end and leaves me frustrated, confused and disinterested in the efforts of the characters. My final statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first, it seemed that the story was about the ghost world overflowing and its means of escape is the Internet. That is a very original idea. I like that. But as the plot continues, the holes of the plot and the unexplained events rising in their heads, it seems that the director changed to an apocalyptic story (as is evident from the end) that has not been clear enough to execute. <br /> <br /> I realize the sadness of the shooting and the scenario was intentional to make the viewer feel gloomy and isolated, but the opacity of the film was only intensified by the grainy and gloomy environment. I admit that there was a certain sense of surrealism with the film, but that could have been my dwindling attention inside and outside. <br /> <br /> The actions of some of the characters are also a little ridiculous, and maybe if the story captivated me more, I could have suspended more disbelief, but at the same time I was unmotivated so were some of characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic behind what certain characters did was absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Maybe it was the result of the incoherence of the plot that the characters do questionable things. To be honest, I really do not care. <br /> <br /> The performance was decent. Certainly nothing exceptional but not terrible either. There are no extreme values ​​to mention on either side of brilliant or simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Now I will stop sounding so bitter and I will mention that there were a handful of spooky moments. One towards the end, especially if there had been more similarities at this time, I would have enjoyed this movie (almost) completely. I thought that every time the website was shown it was quite disturbing, as well as some of the ghostly encounters that our two main characters face. The things that happened between these creepy grudges were too mediocre, disconcerting and "WTF" for me to really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Now there is something related to the DVD ... Magnolia's release of "Pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but subtitles are disabled. They do not say at the right moment of the character's speech. It may seem like a problem, but it bothered me a bit and can annoy others. I think this is the only American release of the movie, so either you have to negotiate or watch the dubbing (NEVER LOOK BEND !!!). I tried to like the movie, I really did. I WANTED that this movie lived up to the exaggerations ... but, unfortunately, I did not like it. If you are looking for another spooky Asian cinema, I can recommend "Audición", "Obturador", "A story of two sisters", "Circo extraño" and "Marebito", all of which are more my palette.
