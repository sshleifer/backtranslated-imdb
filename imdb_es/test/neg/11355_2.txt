I never really thought about watching this movie. I kept watching it on the shelf of the horror movie in my local video rental store and I never thought much about it. Just your career, a zombie movie bland with a bit of blood and a sex scene. Nothing special, I could also see Python ... oh no, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I just decided to see her when some of my friends saw her on TV and said it was a horrible piece. of garbage. So, I decided to check these stories, and only then did I realize how terrible the film was that was hiding behind the soft and uninteresting cover of a DVD box. <br /> <br /> It's not that the idea is bad in itself. A plane is a confined area, and it would be a real deadly trap for the people on board if the zombies showed up ... a good premise for a zombie movie. But this movie took a good stage and was covered in everything with a poor performance, an unstable camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> All the characters have different levels of hate. There are two young couples who are basically friends going on vacation to France. A couple is composed of an athlete and his annoying and rude girlfriend who is entangled with Mr. Jock's best friend, who came with his girlfriend who is a blonde psychopath. There is also a policeman who escorts a scammer (an effeminate and highly annoying swindler). The policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters in the lot. Then there are a lot of hostesses that mostly end up like zombie chow ... no, I did not see the whole movie, it was an experience too painful to perform, almost as bad as seeing the Cannibal Holocaust. Oh, and there's also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a strange air marshal who does not really seem to matter until he's summoned to help deal with the runaway zombies, a trio of scientists who are victims of the undead and a pair of pilots The work of the camera is often unstable, and although many people do not mind, after a while it can really make you nervous, like having a small buzz of flies constantly around your head. It's small but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adulterous couple is really annoying. All they do is have sex in the airplane bathrooms while their wives do not look ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are incredibly annoying. They complain, they complain, they argue and they have some of the most foolish and boring dialogues in the movie ... yes, you're glad to see them die. <br /> <br /> The score is atrocious. It is so generic and uninspired that it kills any kind of suspense that a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. In fact, it sounds like the score of ... Python! That movie will never stop chasing me. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that the filmmakers seemed incredibly determined to have in as many shots as possible. A nun, sitting near the young adults and grabbing her Bible, which is included in so many shots, you start to wonder if she plays an important role in the movie ... but not her, so, why have her in so many? scenes? ? Was it because the original project of the creator of the film was a porn movie of nuns? Nobody will ever know. <br /> <br /> The zombies look pretty good. Their makeup is good and they are probably better actors than the living characters, they are much more convincing and pleasant! The guard responsible for monitoring the scientist's illegal cargo was pretty funny. A large box seems to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp object ... yet he does not scream, wince, or complain. He just grunts and writhes in an attempt to get the thing off his leg ... in fact, it sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, in general, I give 1 for the interesting scenario and 1 for the zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like young adults who quarrel and throw things at each other, and unfortunately, there really is not anything funny about all this, so looking to laugh would probably fail , unless you're drugged with some kind of psychoactive drug.
