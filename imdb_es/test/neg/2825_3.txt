Well, the movie starts well, but after half an hour it gets boring and stupid, when the whole plot is about Karen's pregnancy (that was the name of the girl, right?). <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is really corny and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is more stupid, if the girl came back with her old boyfriend or boy because of the way they used it for her. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my conclusion is this: definitely not the best comedy of the eighties, just another movie like many others without anything special, could do better, but ruined it, if only the plot had they took another form, but they keep those pregnancy things and they definitely ruin themselves, so the final conclusion: I do not like it.
