Like "The Blair Witch Project" before him, "Hatchet" has won its own share of bottom-up advertising (as an avid reader of Fangoria magazine, full-page ads are hard to miss); Even after his theatrical career, the film is destined to subsist only on the advertising that surrounds it, and will probably become an element of worship at some point. With a MySpace URL and a powerful (albeit disconcertingly subjective) promise to preserve the so-called "old-school American horror", "Hatchet" will attract many curiosity seekers with its DVD release (where that statement is recorded on its own disc). Maybe it was the big print propaganda of Is not It Cool News in the ads that made me approach the film with some trepidation (it seems that Harry Knowles and his henchmen will approve any movie for VIP passes and free food), but "Hatchet "It makes me question what is really the idea of ​​the writer and director Adam Green about the" American horror of the old school ": according to the evidence here, it means the insipid tims of the late 80's" Friday the 13th "and" Liberation. " The characters are unpleasant stereotypes (Chris Tucker type black, Survivalist chick, Bimbos topless, old couple required, Asian tourist guide) whose interactions are marred by painful and irresistible dialogues and stabs especially in the mood (not as bad as " Cabin fever ", but still); the script has too much filling (for example, the scene of the "buzzing of bushes"), and "Hatchet" ends as typical as any postmodern killer of the last decade, with its unique distinguishing feature is a kick drum machine calculated by experts. I will give a slight eulogy to the blood: if you can cross the fill between the killings, the red wine is definitely a marvel, and the only real reason to see this.
