Patsy Kensit and a random Australian star as a duo of hard-core police hopefuls in the midst of investigating a series of art gallery-related murders, but among them they can still find the time to shoot store thieves and suspect the new wife of the male policeman to be an adulterer. The serial killer is suddenly no longer important when the alleged lover of the wife (who is basically a co-worker of his own) is murdered and the male policeman becomes the main suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a really boring, implausible and stress-free Australian thriller that obviously mimics popular thrillers like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and almost all the clich√©s of Good Cop / Bad Cop are widely described in the script. The difficult position of female policemen in a body full of men, the mentality of firing first ask questions later, problems with alcohol through stress, etc., etc. Even the unhealthy eating habits of the policemen are a joke. Yawn! Kensit really does everything possible to make this movie more bearable, but lacks the credibility and talent of a true movie heroine. The final turn is more or less interesting (it's nothing original, but, by then, you stopped caring for the characters for a long time). The scenes filmed inside the sex clubs seem ridiculously false and the direction of Clive Fleury is completely boring. What total loss of time?
