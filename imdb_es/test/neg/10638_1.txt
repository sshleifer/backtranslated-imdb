This movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 is so big. Nothing is good Bloodline ... much blood but without meaning and most of the time without originality. The film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon, but nothing seriously links the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, it's just a boring villain who kidnaps children and kills birds, and worse yet ... talks too much. One thing I really did not understand is why the hell dog ????? It can not be a cenobites because it did not have anything human. Why can the dog be killed by pressure if the other creature of hell can receive bullets without problems? Bloodline is inconsistent with the movie series in many ways. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are old friends in this movie, but it is impossible for Pinhead to meet Angelique because Pinhead is only a soldier of World War I and Angelique is an old demon and she has lived in Paris for 200 years.
