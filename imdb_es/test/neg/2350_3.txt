First, let me clarify it. This movie is a piece of real trash, but even though it is a piece of real trash, it is a piece of junk better than it could have been. He could have sucked big, but not ... <br /> <br /> What this movie did not have was, for example, moments of fear, good acting and a good script. It was not very entertaining either. But the movie had good music, elegant places and hot girls. It also works very well as a parody of Dracula. (I hope it was like that, although I really do not think so) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania, waking up an old vampire, who then terrorizes and kills the girls, one by one. . Sounds familiar? Yes it is! <br /> <br /> After reading this, you may think that I should have given a better vote. The reason why I do not do it, is because I almost fell asleep at some points ...
