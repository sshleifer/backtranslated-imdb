Frank Falenczyk: It's not that I regret having killed them; I'm sorry I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a foul. You have a great cast and a great plot with infinite possibilities ... How do you think that? Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious script with jokes as fun as a malaria epidemic and a painfully dry dialogue that makes none of the characters agreeable, 'You Kill Me' could be the biggest film failure of 2007. On a positive note, Ben Kinglsey offers another great success. He acts like the alcoholic Polish man who tries to clean himself, but the material he has to work with is shit. Tea Leoni is good, as are Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I guess the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good performances. Grade: D +
