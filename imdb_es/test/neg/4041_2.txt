It is tempting to see this film as a bold avant-garde experiment. I like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of the comedy film and produce something that was completely, completely, without grace. <br /> <br /> The answer, judging by "De Venus", is a resounding 'Yes'. This may not be the worst movie I've seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all the memories of others. This horrible movie looms right on the edge: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my internal censors have erased it from my conscience. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they did this, or why they went ahead and threw it out once they did. I doubt that someone involved with him has won much, but surely among them they could have gathered enough money to buy all the impressions and burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has nothing to recommend. that. It is not even pleasantly bad. It's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. I thought seriously about getting it back and claiming my money, which is not something I've done before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about renting (let alone buying!) This awful no movie!
