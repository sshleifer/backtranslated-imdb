This show was a surprising, fresh and innovative idea in the 70s when it was first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things fell after that. By 1990, the program was no longer really fun, and it continues its decline until the complete waste of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It is truly shameful how far this program has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the interpretations are almost as bad; If it were not for the respite of the invited guests, this program would probably not be heard. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who hand selected the original cast also chose the hacking band that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see if it is appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt that I should give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show a great success. As it is now, the show is just horrible. I can not believe I'm still in the air.
