There are interesting pieces here of and about the likes and dislikes of Bruce Weber. Maybe if a professional editor had done it for the biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 on a film festival on it. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, apart from that he likes to look at photographs, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers, and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film.
