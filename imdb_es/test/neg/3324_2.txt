I should have known when I heard Anne Rice abandon the project that the film would disappoint me. I could not have predicted that years after its release, just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are incredible, and although I understand that you lose a lot in the translation to the screen, this movie was a great middle finger for your original work. I hope someday someone will try again, in the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and appearance of the main and secondary characters for no reason. They destroy the history of Lestat. The Queen's performance is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can not laugh. The charm and charm of the novels simply does not exist. The film is a bad excuse to group as many musicians and "dark" images into a single movie, hoping that the little Goths of America will tell it to you. Part of the appeal of the first film, of Louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and show the magic and emotion of the vampire world. Thank God I read the books first, or I never would have touched them after this movie.
