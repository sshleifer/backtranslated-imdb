Danny Lee's performance as a blackmail cop is the only point of interest in this film, although he has an excellent cast that includes Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad leader who wants to establish himself in a life of peace and abundance, but Alex Man, a total psychopath who has a big grudge against CYF, will not let him. CYF tries to escape to Malacca but without success. After his family is destroyed, his cronies are dead or in mesh, injured and broken, CYF returns to Hong Kong to take revenge for something. <br /> <br /> It sounds a lot better than it is. CYF is well dressed and handsome, looks hurt, makes a face and cries at the right time, but somehow or other you just do not care. Andy Lau looks great, but that's it. Carina Lau has a tiny little part that was nice, but she gets a bullet in the head from the beginning and that ends. Alex Man is a villain of caricatures that is so exaggerated that sometimes it can be intriguing, but what I write here is so flat that it is presented as a variety of garden nut. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is great though, it's a shame that it's just a small dot on the screen of this dark movie (literally) and essentially boring. <br /> <br /> Rent it, do not buy it. Or simply omit it altogether. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to "Rich And Famous", although apparently it was filmed simultaneously; it was first released by the power of the CYF box office.
