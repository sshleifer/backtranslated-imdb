Oh, my God, I'm really fed up with all these generic Japanese horror movies about long-haired ghosts and ghostly children. "Ghost Train" is not an exception. It is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago, I was interested in these stories of modern ghosts, because they usually gave me some goose bumps, unfortunately there is nothing new or interesting in "Ghost Train". In fact, the movie is really boring. Noriko disappears in an underground tunnel, like a classmate from an elementary school, Nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a juvenile train driver and another mother of a "disappeared" child. the effects are ridiculous and the climax is illogical.
