If you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable story, maybe this movie is for you. Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jack Warden and several other supporting cast members actually have talent, but were completely stifled by the fine paper script. This is a generally boring and joyless waste of time from a movie.
