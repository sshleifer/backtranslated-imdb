The only good thing about Persepolis are the shadows created in the German expressionist style of animation and a touch of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here, she finds great discontent once more and finally goes to the end to let everyone else in her country realize the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It does not reach any conclusion and leaves us with the feeling that this woman does not have loyalties. Look, she is divided between cultures and does not have a background that seems to understand what is important and real. She listens to so many voices and is very likely to end up being a world citizen of some kind that one with ties to her native Iranian culture. The only thing I got from this movie was the anguish.
