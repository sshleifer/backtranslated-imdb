I went to see this movie mainly because it looked very good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should equal greatness. Instead, it just continues Williams' slump of movies lately. What's wrong with the movie? More like what's right: the whole team does a pretty good job around Robin, and as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That said, this movie was just not good. I really only recommend seeing him if you want to see what it would be like if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. Saying that he won is not a spoiler, since he was in the trailer. The concept and idea are really fun, but that's it. Most of Robin's jokes are only recycled from old comedy snippets, and there are very few moments of laughter out loud, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that turn out to be crap, all the fun parts are placed in the trailer. There really are no surprises there, but let's go! Something from the movie reads like a novel by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected this to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more of a Flubber.
