This is the second addition to the Oz movie trilogy produced personally by Frank Baum. It is essentially the same childlike character as in the other two images, although I consider it preferable to others because it is shorter. As in the other films, there are artists in animal costumes, an adult woman posing as a child, and the characters and the plot jump everywhere while the camera work is static. This time, in the center there is a magic layer that grants wishes, and the child played by a woman becomes king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are seen at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography. And, there is a man on the moon who looks like the events of Georges Méliès years before, the most famous in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). The imaginative fantasies and the effects of the creative tricks of Méliès made him the pioneer of primitive cinema, and the films he made at the beginning of the century were much better and even more technically advanced than this insignificant series of Oz.
