This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Writing and acting are just pathetic. It's up to Uncle Sam in the worst movies of all time. However, when I see shit like this one capable of making a video, it really inspires me to pursue my crazy dreams of making movies because I know I could do a better job than what the creators of Killers did.
