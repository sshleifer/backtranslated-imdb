I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I love the most. Therefore, the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really do not understand why some people here give it. a nine or even a ten. Their demands are very low or they have not read the book or both. Even if I had not read the book I would still consider the movie as an absolute average and I would give it a five. The spooky and mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear only once in the film, when I saw it for the first time in the cinema, I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted? Why was Barney portrayed as an ignorant mute whose only ambition is to make money? And, above all, why did the psychological process that Starling went through last, caused by the drugs that Lecter applied to him, come down? Not to mention the fact that the ending was also omitted and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted them, although I'm probably very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal, which has such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when it is adapted for the screen, but as the Germans say, that is "yesterday's snow". Ridley Scott made some incredibly good movies, but with this she does not live up to her name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships between them in The Silence of the Lambs, he should have done Hannibal too. My only consolation is that I've only seen the movie twice, it's been a long time ago, and thank God for that reason, I can not see the scenes from the movie when I read the novel. I'm really sorry, but I really can not recommend it to anyone.
