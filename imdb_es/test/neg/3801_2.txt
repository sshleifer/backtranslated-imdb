Aftermath, well, there are many reasons to create them, but what went through the mind of Irwin Allen to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. There are so many open responses to this movie that it's ridiculous ... like The Poseidon, which is a monstrous ship with passengers drifting in the sea, and only Michael Caine with his miniboat and an evil Telly Savalas discover the ship ... Well , at the beginning, the French navy is circling above the shipwreck with its helicopter, but as a sinking cruise is something everyday, they simply fly away ... What am I trying to say? Hmmm, Michael Caine gets on board with Sally Field and could pick up everything he sees (diamonds) if there was not a Telly Savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship ... My God, why am I losing my words in here? It's ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine were involved makes you think what went through your mind when reading scripts ... certainly not diamonds ...
