This movie should be called adventures in cinemascope. It's as if the scriptwriter and director took the sketch of Cliff's Notes 3 and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue does not look like Hemingway at all. This is an invented version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. Look at the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. That's a great cinema and it was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls, where he is rigid as a board and believes he is in a western. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a Hemingway fan, do it. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. The best thing you can do is get the full audio CD and listen to one of the best novels ever written.
