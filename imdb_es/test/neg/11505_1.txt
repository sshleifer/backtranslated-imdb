Naturally, Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen in my life, it's a piece of shit ** and it's loaded with all the bullsh **. I did not find any of the gags to be funny or something intelligent, they were horrible jokes. <br /> <br /> The performance stinks, many of the characters stank when acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters also stink (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative at all and the show is very predictable. This is one of the worst shows ever made, it should not even have been made, the idiots who are responsible for writing this junk should be fired (if they did not already) The first season was really visible, but the second The season was just a disaster, it is too hard to see this show, it is more than horrible.
