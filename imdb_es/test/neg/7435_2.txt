LTL is the kind of themed and hopeless comedy that can be enjoyed by the kind of sheep that stop and listen when they meet a band that plays in a mall. I remember that Murray promoted LTL in the crap of Larry King. CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie does not become a hit, I will stop making movies (or comedies)". I was not being as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was a sure blow and that his failure would mean that his status as a star had fallen noticeably, therefore, a kind of live ultimatum for his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a silly elephant comedy. (The comedy is silly, not the elephant ...) Or maybe he just realized during the shoot (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone of how much optimism he had regarding to the LTL. quality. "Go see it, it's really good!" The actors are prostitutes who cross paths with car dealers. <br /> <br /> LTL is the lousy type of project that comes from the comedy school "Friends"; his motto: "If you ever run out of ideas, or if you never had any in the first place, then stick an animal in the plot and that will at least inject an element of tenderness." Cuteness = a sad substitute for the lack of funny gags. The other motto that had "Friends" was: "always include a meaningless and boring sentimentality", with which this film ends so predictably, when Murray says pathetically: "What they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". Maybe it's not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. Suddenly I remembered that when I saw a scene on today's television (hence this equally useless criticism). <br /> <br /> Murray wasted his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but it is not. It's almost as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or as the man's name is spelled); one might think that M.M. It would be very easy for him to play himself, that is, a hick, but it is so painfully funny and unconvincing that he could barely stand to see him make such a fool of himself. It was worth trembling. To round off this nonsense, we have that buffoon of Generation X, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. On the other hand, everything related to LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After LTL, which bombed for what I know, Murray became more of a "serious actor". What's up with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it just about getting prizes, that is, "recognition from your peers" (read: votes from your idiot colleagues)? This piece of shit marked the end of a series of good and excellent films that Murray made in the early and mid-90s, such as "Groundhog Day," "Quick Change," "Mad Dog & Glory," "Kingpin," " What about Bob? "And" Ed Wood. " Recently, we have had the immense pleasure of seeing it in the trash / mediocrities like "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you can not get away from these "ultra talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare those two lots. <br /> <br /> A boy described LTL "funny as hell". That's the kind of audience that this movie was waiting for ... Shopping centers and trailer parks ...
