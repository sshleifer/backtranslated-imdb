I am surprised to read all the positive comments about this movie. Even my 4 and 6 years were bored. Squirrels are cute ... but the story is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with less sophisticated tastes. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughter from the audience while we were attending; but I was wondering why. <br /> <br /> I do not admit that I was never a fan of the "squirrels", but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an "escapist" movie for what I can say. Simply a hard-line vision of 'too young success is spoiled'. We've seen more than enough with Britney Spears, et al, right? <br /> <br /> Do not worry.
