Laughter would be a good term to describe this movie. But, since this movie does not deserve anything good from that, I will use the horrible term of God. <br /> <br /> Focused on the adventures of a group of ecological warriors investigating the infamous acts of the army on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget quickly becomes evident. Michael Pare (a real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads the group of fools through a series of monstrous scenes of victim chase and defeat. There is a vague attempt in the pseudoscience to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the spectator as much as the performance does. <br /> <br /> As if this does not insult the viewer enough, the film also presents what I will call "Weapons of endless ammunition". I never saw Mickey Parrot or his side kick change clips once during the whole movie, but I can positively report that they end up at least 40 shots in each scene where they are required to fire their weapons. Maybe forty rounds do not look like so many, but here we are talking about standard pistols. Figure 15 round clip, tops. And remember, they never change the clips, nor do they seem to carry additional ammunition. <br /> <br /> It's like a fool like this who consigns films to the eternal fires of the celluloid of hell, and rightly so. The CGI third category does little to help matters and it is better to laugh at the performance, otherwise, you will start to cry. The reason why SciFi Channel repeatedly produces this porridge is what anyone can suppose. <br /> <br /> My advice ... give this one a big detour ... a big detour!
