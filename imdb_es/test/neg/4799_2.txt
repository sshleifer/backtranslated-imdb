The bipolarity of this movie is maddening. At one point he is making fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and the banana republics in general, and the other wants to be moving, with burnt and orphaned people. Even the serious revolutionary hero, becomes a parody of a revolutionary at any given time. But the parts of the comedy are not even funny, because they are obviously stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. Add to this the effects of stereotyped sounds, Latin Americans who speak English among themselves and a villain who simply disappears from history. And what is the point? It is basically propaganda of the revolution without resolution and without planning (because, simply, there is no way that these people can lead a country). The government of the United States is bad, but who will make money by producing this? He's not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
