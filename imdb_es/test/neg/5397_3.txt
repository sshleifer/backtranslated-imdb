"Do you have beans? The beans are good, you just eat them and leave." I could not help but laugh at that bit of dialogue. Beans are the musical fruit, you know. The more you eat them, the more you go toot, toot, toot. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... Ok, I can understand why the actors were in this because they needed checks to pay their bills, but I'm not sure what the intentions of the director and writer were. Even after watching the making-of documentary on the DVD extras. <br /> <br /> Mike Rooker gave this one a performance he did not really deserve. I've seen it in other movies MUCH better than this one. What would have greatly improved this movie was to throw everything away, keep Rooker and, instead, make another entry to the franchise "The Substitute." Rooker would have become an excellent substitute teacher who instructs naughty young people with moral disabilities regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really should not 'You're just pushing through the undergrowth that way, since you could get oak poison. Whoops. No matter. I suppose the poison oak is the least of your worries now. Well, at least this time your croak was not made by the tail of a giant python. There are few things more embarrassing than being pierced through the chest by a giant snake. At least the scene of death in this movie had a little more dignity. As well as a more liberal smear of karo syrup and red food coloring. Nothing says a sad and tragic death like the liberal use of the karo and the red tint! <br /> <br /> The first time I see a monster wearing a shiny rayon cape with a fur collar. First time for everything, I suppose. However, just to be nervous, if it was an Indian ghost, why did it look exactly like a monster outside European culture and folklore? Would not it have been the most Indian monster? <br /> <br /> While I watched this until the final credits, I really do not think I can recommend it in good faith to others.
