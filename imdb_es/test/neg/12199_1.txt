Acting 10, Script 1. "Hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern theater school that has declared that anything that resembles a story or plot is forbidden. While people can get away with it on stage, in the film it becomes deadly, or at least mortally boring. We are left with a group of great actors that emit dialogues that, although written brilliantly, do not give anything. Worse, all the characters speak with the same voice despite their origins. The only attempt to differentiate is to make the teenager Anna Paquin use the word "is not". <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the characters are extremely unfriendly, the work of the camera is simply careless and (for LA residents) attention to geography is ridiculous. (Hint: the view from Sean Penn's front window is about eight miles from the view from his back window, and he can not drive south through Hollywood and end up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank). that - and I would normally not pay attention to small things like that, because they are just whims of production. But, the fact that they stood out in spite of the pyrotechnics on the screen says a lot about the weakest element of this company: the script. <br /> <br /> In summary, omit this, even in the video. Rabe chose the wrong quotation from the Scottish work for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better called "A story told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, which means nothing". A little long for the tent, perhaps, but at least it would be an honest advertisement.
