I saw this movie a few years ago and I do not want to play golf again. I mean the ninjas who apparently have no respect for the game of golf or how it has evolved. And I'm not talking about "victimless" things like forging a scorecard. No no. Based on what I have seen here, they blatantly massacre cops and golfers on the sacred grounds of country clubs. Judge Smailes would be turning in his grave. And do they repent for such sins? No, no, according to what I've seen here, the typical response of a murdered ninja is to take over the body of a telephone repairman and seek revenge. I think this is morally reprehensible, and it goes without saying that, after seeing this nonsense, I not only stopped playing golf and talking on the phone, but I also decided to stop feeding the homeless.
