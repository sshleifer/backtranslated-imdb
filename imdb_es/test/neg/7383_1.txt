Oh my God!!!! This was the first Broken Lizard movie made in a group (although it recently came to the video), and it has never disappointed me in my entire life. I'll tell you what, if I had seen this movie before seeing Super Troopers (which by the way, it's a movie A $$ !!!), I would never have seen it! I had read several reviews online, as well as on the cover of the DVD, which read: "The most fun movie of Broken Lizard!" Now, if they referred to Super Troopers as the funniest movie in history, I would agree without stopping, but it is not. Talk about dry. The film took about 45 minutes to get going, and by then, I was so eager to see it that it was not worth it. Maybe you have to be tall to make it really fun? I dont know. I love these guys, I really do, but that movie is by far the worst they've done. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this one, just wow. I highly recommend Super Troopers if you want to laugh, but if you want more romance, drama, with some fun places, I'd say with Puddle Cruiser. However, I only think that everyone has the right to theirs. :)
