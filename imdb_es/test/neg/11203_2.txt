Tarzan, the leader in environmental awareness, faces four trappers who, by unorthodox means, kidnap animals to take them to zoos. Tarzan has a pretty soft but sexy wife with an impeccable hairstyle, and a boy. No one should blame Tarzan for feeling saddened by the vicious actions of the hunters. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan movie is one of the dumbest, complete and unnecessarily silly; For one reason or another, the team did not find anything charming to hold the film, so it's just silly nonsense. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers, because Tarzan's environmental conscience led him into open conflict with the malefactors. The child and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by malevolent trappers; so Tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to free the boy and the chimpanzee, with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE TRAPS is silly, unattractive, uninteresting. Maybe as a child I would have liked it? Now one has to be too cruel, as brutally cruel as the pathetic trappers punished by Tarzan, to ask a Tarzan movie not to be silly; I grant this. But one also has the true right to ask these Tarzan films, however foolish they may be, to show some enthusiasm, even a little enthusiasm. Some kicks, some excitement, some fun. Now, the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is too foolish exactly in the sense of having no enthusiasm at all, of lacking all emotion. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast that ate a snake What a beast Look at the movie, kids, now here I just gave you an excuse to do it). For one reason or another, the villains look somewhat pathetic and provoke Mercy instead of virtuous anger. <br /> <br /> The books leave the impression that Tarzan looked pretty bright in his own way; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or other sportsman who looked smart enough for the role could be too demanding a task, almost impossible, Gordon Scott was too far from achieving that ideal. <br /> <br /> The wife berates Tarzan for not liking the books. <br /> <br /> The script suggests that Tarzan had no education, was almost illiterate and was adverse to learning; but the book says otherwise, and we know that Tarzan studied a lot, by himself, using the books of his missing family, even before meeting white people. <br /> <br /> And I did not like that scream. <br /> <br /> (It is supposed, dear children, that it is a real wild scream, not a lost yodeler).
