In 1913, in Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine used poor children in exploration and, after an explosion, a group of children is buried alive. In the current days, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness when family savings have been spent on treatment. Without money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home during the night, and Sarah finds out that there are zombies in the area. When Emma befriends Mary, her mother thinks she is an imaginary friend. However, when zombie children attack and eat Sarah's friends alive and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her near the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a totally bad movie: the acting is good; the makeup is creepy; and cinematography and music are excellent. However, the story, and consequently the script, are very weak, in fact, a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, with a widow who moves to a house in a remote place because the family spent all its resources on the patriarch's illness. But when she arrives, coincidentally, the small zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families do not look for missing persons. Then, the evil Mr. Carlton arrives at the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that he will die in the end. There is no explanation of why children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah flees with her mother and says she's tired and can not run anymore, it's one of the stupidest lines I've seen in a horror movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
