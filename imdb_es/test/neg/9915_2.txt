A useless effort. On the surface it is a typical disaster film: we are involved in the lives of a few people who get trapped in the Great Event. However, the script is so horrible and there is so much explanation of the backgrounds of the characters in the dialogue that we feel we are being treated like idiots. Even Sesame Street did not explain the origins of Mr. Snuffleupagus or how Mr. Hooper died: we can solve it. Someone thought that the introduction of 'Enron' in the script would give you money when talking about power companies. The acting is, in general, tasteless, with the exception of the older artists (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour, I could not care less who the storms took away from. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to see. Sadly not. Even on a 20-year-old TV, I could see that a tractor and a trailer were poorly computer generated. Maybe there are budget constraints, so I can forgive that. The images of an airplane trying to land seemed very real, but I repeated that I had seen that before. This site confirms it: it was from a previous movie, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only good fragments are from another movie, and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30- Second network promotion, it makes category 6 look pretty good. My advice: trust your network to make good 30-second clips, watch them and save yourself two nights.
