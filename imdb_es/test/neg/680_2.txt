The director seems a good and solid man. His parents struggle with the same problems that we all face. They moved away from each other. They love each other. They misinterpreted each other. And the poor audience has to sit for ninety minutes of what may be the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families out of Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting options in this documentary. -the music is banal, the filming is not inspired, and the story is the same story that unfolds on every birch street in every city in the United States. I do not want to seem too hard, rarely has a sweeter and well-intentioned documentary been made. The director is the kind of man you would like to be friends with. You just wish he had struggled so hard to present the material as his parents did to keep his marriage alive.
