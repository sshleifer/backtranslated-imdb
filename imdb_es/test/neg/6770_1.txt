I caught a screening of this at the True / False Documentary Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was quite disappointed. I expected a good documentary about the protest and the activism that surrounded the RNC, but what I got was a very evil story, badly acted, fictitious, with a badly woven conspiracy. He had heard about his neodocumented technique, which combines "true and false", but he expected something more like a fictitious plot developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity among the real interviews, but it was more The lines of a terrible movie of television made by the conspiracy theory. <br /> <br /> The performance in general is terrible except for Rossario, which is not surprising, considering that the Director at the screening said that most of the main characters had no performance. Training, his excuse is that he wanted them to be real. Here is an indication that real people can not act, but actors can generally act in a real way. <br /> <br /> It would not have been so offensive if it was not so obvious about how interested I was in insisting on this. The radical conspiracy theory about us throughout the film is especially hysterical when we have a scene in which the director approaches and starts ranting about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The film also does a good job of ridiculously stereotyping each role, trying hard to romanticize these street activists and to print a great "Good" or "Evil" in each character. <br /> <br /> Jump, maybe find yourself a good real documentary /
