On Halloween, three friends look for an old graveyard in the suburb to have fun and take a cross from a grave, where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family to take revenge. <br /> <br /> The cheesy "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with a horrible performance. I was curious about the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total lack of respect for the name of this great actor. It's amazing how bad the acting is, changing the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the kind of movie that you can see well with a group of friends, drink beer, make comments and laugh a lot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O Dem√¥nio do Halloween" ("Jack-O ?? Demon of the Halloween")
