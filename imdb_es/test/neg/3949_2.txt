I was not thrilled to see this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to go see it the night of the premiere. I felt like getting up and going out and trying to get my money back in this movie for 20 minutes. I felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many aspects, including the "game". I did my best not to fall asleep during the movie while watching one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was more scary than this movie. The sad attempt to attract a goth girl, an overworked businessman, a 15-year-old geek and a random guy in a video game that kills you is a bad plan to start. Then they try to throw a horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was killed. The theater was overcrowded when the movie started before it finished a little more than half of the people who had left before it was over. If you feel the need to lose only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... prepare to feel cheated.
