There are spoilers but trust me, I'm doing you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to watch fucking movies once in a while. Inspired by Mystery Science Theater and our ability to make jokes instantly; We set out to find films that are worth seeing, in fact, not worth watching. However, problems come to paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I am a firm believer in not giving a penny to a group of scandalous without talent. So, as another reviewer said, movies like this one are a reason why downloading free movies should be legalized. I prefer the idea of ​​Instead of directly to VIDEO you have directly to INTERNET. That way, the disgusting people who made this farce will never make a profit. How unfortunately you know they do it. They hire a group of actors who can not act, the special effects of a high school classroom, the rubber snakes that you can get in the dollar store, the constant vomiting of green jelly and the two main characters that seem to change between be border. The Mexican jumpers who only speak Spanish, the Arabs to be 100% fluent in English, random nudity, a guy who gets shots like 10 times, including one next to the head and the most delayed ending in the history of cinema, book , Cave drawings and hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the snake girl who vomits gelatin would actually become a snake half-way terrifies me ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is great to tease, but You must make sure that there are at least 4 of you and you are all telling jokes at full speed, because if there is even 1 second of watching this movie where you are not spoiling yourself, you will feel physically sick. It is not a joke. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and now I can not look at such a thing without being reminded of this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Alien vs. Hunter, which is by far the second worst movie ever made. And I've seen many bad movies. By the way, it's the same production company that this movie and that bald guy is also in both. I just thought you'd like to know that funny little fact. -100 of 0f 10.
