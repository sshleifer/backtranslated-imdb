What gives Anthony Minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction? First, he destroyed The English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I discover that he is killing Cold Mountain - slaughtered! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to The English Patient. My son and I went to see him the first weekend it was published, and I was very disappointed, but I told my son that he felt he needed to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to find out what the critics were talking about when they said that Minghella had trusted the public enough to go to the movies to give them a great movie. . That is what he surely did not do. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not read much fiction, but Cold Mountain was so recommended by my friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it was presented in theaters, and that was what Minghella had done to The English Patient. But like a fool, I rented it today, and I'm so upset that I had to vent my frustration and, above all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and created it into something almost so beautiful in the world. Screen, and now they never will. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND LET THE MOVIE BE ON THE SHELF. I will never again get carried away by a Minghella project. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise that Hollywood has built up in his head. It must be that nobody in Hollywood read more. This movie does not look anything like the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego should know no limits, and if he did not like the book, why did not he write an original script and leave the book alone? Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider this movie one of the worst I've seen since 2003; and I have seen almost everything that has been released to see it in the USA. UU <br /> <br /> Elaine, you're not going to like this either.
