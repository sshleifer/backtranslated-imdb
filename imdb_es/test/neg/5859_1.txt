I turned this off in about 50 minutes! Whoever the jerk who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's book (Battle Royal), and turn it into a pathetic stage of a reality TV show, deserves to be filmed. <br /> <br /> It has made the film industry good turn though Now, directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say "well, at least it's better than Series 7". This piece of shit and the Dracula 3000 tie are in first place in the worst 100 films ever made! <br /> <br /> Note that this is not a 'So bad is good'! Click! <br /> <br /> This is a shame for filmmakers around the world! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
