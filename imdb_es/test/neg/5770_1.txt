And believe me, it's a pretty impressive achievement. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove", change the murderer from pirate to prospector, change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold and his color from green vomit to deep blue. Now you have "Slaughter of miners". The problem is that, at least, "Jolly Roger" was entertaining enough, although in such a bad way that it's good, so you can keep seeing it for the full two hours. There is no assassination scene, nor strange murders. I can not say how many times I lost interest in the "Massacre of the Miners" and began to wash the dishes or clean the condo. And, the ending is absolutely silly. The 49er guy just appeared randomly out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and the actress are sitting on the sheriff's cruise, screaming. A really horrible movie.
