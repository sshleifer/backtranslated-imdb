I was also disappointed with this movie. For starters, the things that happen to him do not seem too terrible (Sorry, macho chauvinist, PoV). As one of the captors said: "Most men will pay to be in their position." To which he responds "But this is not my choice". Okay, okay, how bad was it really? Please let us know. But now the kicker: do not let anyone know, until after the end of the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, not a mentor, not the police, or anyone. Instead, he comes up with the brilliant plan of f * ck * ng to every girl he knows, so he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his captors. Did I think I had had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his captivity? Is not it time to take a little break from all that? For me, to put it mildly, the ill advised actions broke the film's "suspension of disbelief". I pulled out a book while I watched the last half hour out of the corner of my eye.
