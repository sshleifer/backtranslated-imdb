What can I say? This was a horrible movie to watch. Normally I am not very critical of gay movies in general, due to the fact that most of them tend to be low budget, but this really pushed me to the wall. I mean, was this what happened to gay movies? Have gay producers and directors not learned anything from the films of Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee? The fact that I had to sit down during the whole movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. I kept praying for the moments when I would feel some kind of connection with any of the characters, but that never happened. Most of the performances of the characters were not very convincing. It was like watching one of those specials of movies made for badly produced TV on local access TV stations. I can not tell you how disappointed I was. I was watching this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spellings, of other works and of the directors who worked in "Latter Day Saints". It definitely was not worth the wait. Definitely, a few hours of my life I will never go back and I certainly will not buy it on DVD.
