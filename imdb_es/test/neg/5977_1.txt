The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when viewed under the influence, but it is not good at all. A 15-minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and shooting acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all. All the actors in this movie have gone to do better things, except for the main girls that I could not think of in a movie where I had seen them before. I hate hitting movies, but I also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. The movie is sad, not very funny and had great potential with its incredible cast. If it were rewritten and written, it could be incredible. If you want a good movie to see stoned, look at Grandma's Boy, or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused, but this is not a movie to be seen at all.
