This movie reeks of the planning production line. It seems that the filmmakers watched recent movies and threw spaghetti on the screen: Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film addresses the age of the Stewart / Allyson artists; However, I am sure that we are still supposed to think that they are much younger. <br /> <br /> There are messages in the "Strategic Air Command" that I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick to one really miserable Element: the happily married couple is challenged when the character of Mr. Stewart makes an important decision without consulting his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the movie, she calls him. It ends without resolving: Allyson is crying her heart in her bed and Stewart abandons her. Without discussion; he simply says he is right, and leaves with his wife devastated. As far as he knows, she could cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> Stay with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
