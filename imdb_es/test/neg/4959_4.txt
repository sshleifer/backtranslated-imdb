From the point of view of the budget, 2.5m CAD is not much when analyzing the animatronics, the puppets in this movie, and that's only the reason for the 9-week session. I really wanted to see this movie and I was hoping to catch it when I came out, instead, I got it on a DVD recently. My main problem is that it's just not funny, it's better than Tenacious D, who does not have a funny bone in his body. But this was a really disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very strong physical performer, but his performance sucks! Rachel Skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and funny performances I've ever seen. The only really BIG star in this is David Scott, whose work of art for the monsters is fabulous! His special effects work is the main reason why this movie is worth watching. I loved the Cyclops and Troll, and Prof. Monster came out of Henson's library. <br /> <br /> If you see it, it will not be the biggest waste of time, but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy, do not worry.
