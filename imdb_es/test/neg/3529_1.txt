Hello everyone, <br /> <br /> I bought this on a DVD from England. You see, I have one of those multiregional players. I thought it would be fun to get a great movie to show my friends. Well, surprise Amy-Jo Johnson, she's barely in the movie. Although she is on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how such a bad movie was made in the first place. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about vampires living on the beach
