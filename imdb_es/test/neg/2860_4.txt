Child's Play created a new horror genre, THE KILLER DOLLS. Some of these movies do not have much money to do it, but I think the only movie that overshadows Chucky is the next one. Ok, it's a typical product. to video or directly to television, but Pinocchio is not real and the murderer is the girl. The children's imagination is too big and this movie plays with it. The papers are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
