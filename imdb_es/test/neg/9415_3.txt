You know I only saw 15 minutes of this movie, so I can not describe how great it is. I mean, the concept is just so original and intriguing that it just did not let me go. Then there is the large number of Academy Award winning people involved here, in addition to the director nominated for the academy award. YOU CAN NOT FAIL I mean imagine it's half the night and you're still not sleepy. This movie lights up. You look at it and you're surprised. It is so bright, so original that it is so BIG. You will feel that half an hour later you have turned off the screen, but when you go to your bed, you see that it is only 15 minutes after midnight. ENJOY !!! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
