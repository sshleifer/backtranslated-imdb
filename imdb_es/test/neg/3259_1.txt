After seeing Caddyshack 1, I heard that there was a sequel and I decided to look for it. The movie seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away, but stupid I gave myself and bought the damn thing! All the criticism and everything bad you've heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is simply full of ideas and the most unusual plot and jokes I've heard, the gopher, the whole movie acting is really bad (although Randy Quaid was fun). <br /> <br /> Just stay away from This movie as much as you can is all I can say. I deeply regret having seen and bought the DVD, but I am not sure which was the worst decision. Just stay away as much as possible.
