This show does not make any sense. Each week, two women go to a farm to do gardening, and every week, without fail, they run into a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a big garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they somehow find one murder after another, would not it be smart to tell the police? The people who can really do something about it ... But every week, these two fools are out there, polluting evidence, committing their own crimes and, in some cases, causing more murders. Once the murders are miraculously resolved, there is no way the killer can be convicted. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And one would think that the people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, is not it? Hurrah! We have solved the murder! Now, like every other week, we go and confront the murderer ourselves and, without support, we tell them we know. There's no way we can put ourselves in danger, right? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst television shows, and certainly the most ridiculous one.
