This revision is for the set of three DVD discs in the United Kingdom. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains a model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Quick and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The last album is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. The fact that the other four episodes of the series are not included is a mystery, because surely there is enough space on the discs for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode opens with the hotel manager, Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied client. Then we can see how the story unfolds when guests check in at the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is about a waitress. Writers should be given credit for presenting a good variety of arguments. For example, Model Behavior is about two models competing for the attention of the photography team; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and a woman who separated and rekindled their love when they met again at the hotel; She's the Boss is about a male secretary / body of dogs that shows that he is more man than his female boss realized, for his pleasure. All the episodes lead to a lot of nudity and sex. <br /> <br /> It should not be surprising that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful and handsome women. Even the geek secretaries are transformed when they take off their glasses and let go of their hair. The sexual action is abundant but for me it seems too frantic and false. The work of the camera could also have been done with a little moderation, spending a lot of time up close and thus moving to capture everything, and as usual we have strong music during sexual action. Finally, the final credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although my map of Florida does not show Singer Island. The landscape certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is a great effort and it is a pity that the second series is still waiting for a UK DVD release. 4 stars.
