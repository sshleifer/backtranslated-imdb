On paper, this film has some skills: a street child overcoming a past trauma, rebuilding his life and triumphing when the world would have ruled it out. Great things, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the theater, however, there were some omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was empty and uninteresting, the characters were almost caricatured in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone need to be homosexual? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie, but when used in this way, it is not only offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes lifestyle and cheapens the movie. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should have been cut. <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed to come out in the same way as cookie cutters: Each had a major defect and a minor defect, all the characters have a good heart. They were successful or not, and each of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you forget the name "pip". It comes from great expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story shares enough with Dickens's classic to make this fact obvious. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette left for Pip and how Pip, the main character, learns how to grow from the lessons learned from the film. In the end, with the lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and the films ahead with his life.
