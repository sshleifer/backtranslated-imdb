Even with his low budget, this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. It started quite well, and quite attractive and credible. The actors and characters were interesting although there was not much development of the character. My favorite scene was when everyone ate their rations. Some seemed to hate it, and others seemed to think it was not so bad. The story begins very hermetically. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then he plunged into a little horror that is usually a death sentence for most science fiction. Suddenly, there is no scientific basis for any of the events. Is not it a true final game for the villain? There is no real explanation of what is happening. Generally, if a movie has to use the word F for each of the other words, it usually spirals down from there as well. I still get offended, believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad science fiction. Is not there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? People do not feel that they are wasting time and others when they put things like this. Why do we have so much mediocre science fiction like this? Are there no female actors / characters either? None at all? This had the capacity to be another "Predator", but unfortunately it fell short. <br /> <br /> My last comment: a poor edition and, finally, a budget too low to build a real bonfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice to any low budget sci-fi film production company. Make sure you have a good story before you start and eliminate the bad special effects; it is better that we do not see anything that seems false or ridiculously diffuse.
