I bought this because it cost $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it, and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read some comments here about the film and started to get excited; maybe it really was a lost gem, one of those fantastic little B movies that everyone had forgotten but deserved to be resurrected. INCORRECT! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it has received from some sectors here, but it seemed like one of the most tedious and full of bathrobes movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about the hokey Texas accent of Richard Carlson (I guess directly from the Texas part of Georgia). It is simply silly. Nobody in the movie behaves like a true human being. None. And nobody does anything credible or interesting. It's not even a festival of cliches. It's only 80 minutes of frames going by. He even made Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now that is incredible.
