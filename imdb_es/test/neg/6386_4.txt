I went into this movie waiting / waiting for some drive-in style of the exploitation of the seventies, but what I got was more of a strange pseudo western with too much talk and not enough action. It is clear that this movie was made on a budget; the locations are monotonous and poorly taken, while the performance leaves a lot to be desired too. The plot centers on a trio of thieves (a father and two sons) who steal a load of gold after killing some miners. They meet a cabin inhabited by a young woman and her stepmother ... and all this is told in flashbacks of the young woman, who currently resides in an asylum. It is clear that the directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really impressive; but despite his best efforts, South of Hell Mountain is too boring to surprise the viewer. The film lasts for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters who emit boring and long dialogues. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is with respect to music; What is good in some places. The ending is the only other good thing in the movie; And that's just because it's the last thing that happens. I would not recommend anyone bother to trace this ... there was a much better trash made in the seventies.
