He gave it two stars because the cover of the DVD was good enough to make me buy this piece of manure. I paid a dollar for it in the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good movies (at least I think they are good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. After seeing this, I am really insulted by that. Light years worse than anything I've seen, I can not even recommend this as a joke movie. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How this horrible movie found some kind of distro? I can only believe that it was self distributed as suggested by amateur DVD authoring. For the producers of this "movie" out of business, it is obvious that you have no talent for it.
