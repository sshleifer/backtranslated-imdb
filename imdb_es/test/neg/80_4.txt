A comedy in expansion, too ambitious and without plot that does not have a dramatic center. It was probably thought to have an epic vision and a surrealist style (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories never become a significant whole, and the laughter is few and far between. Fun ending, however. (* 1/2)
