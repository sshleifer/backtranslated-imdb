Normally I do not give the movies a "1". Although I am a NO HEART critic, I try to find something that makes the film worthwhile (that is, can be seen). The main thing I look for is a coherent plot. If you have that alone, I can see it! Let me start by saying, this does not even deserve to be called a movie, it's more like a primary school project ... it has gone terribly wrong! And I've seen all the special science fiction movies that have been made. <br /> <br /> Many times I have read reviews from professional critics who say shit like "This was played like a Made-for-TV ... (etc, etc)" and I kept saying "Oh, come on, I I would like you to think of a REAL criticism. " Well this is worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that has lasted the duration of a movie (if I considered it a movie, it would be my worst new movie of all time), and I've seen all the movies that Uwe Boll did! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I prefer to watch Jaws the Revenge all day, then see this one more time ... even within 5 minutes of that ... there was a good scene and it was the END! - P Well, enough to criticize the works of Ron Hall, now for serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The script is badly written, the dialogue is delivered in a wooden manner, the effects are more difficult than those of a Power Rangers are shown, and they do not even make me start in the approach transitions (ugh ) from the screen. Someone really saw this, edited it and then said: "ok, let go". I would have preferred to burn this before releasing it! To finish, all I can say is "Thank God that DVD and VHS players have the function of stopping and ejecting!" My advice ... do not rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you arrested and expelled too! :)
