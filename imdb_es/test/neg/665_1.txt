After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for any of those who participated in the making of this abysmal film. On the one hand, as a general comment, the plot was literally incredible and full of incredible clich√©s. Obviously, the same happens with the dialogue that satisfies the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The performance was also terrible, since Kane showed, throughout the entire film, at most 3 separate and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed, as each accessory was easily distinguishable from its counterpart in real life. In general, I would not recommend anyone to even think about seeing this function, since it will surely waste 83 (not even 90!) Minutes of your life.
