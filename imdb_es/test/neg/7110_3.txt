This 1988 film was recently shown on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie, which was supposedly starting, but due to confusion, Rent-a-Cop showed up in that space of time. Having never seen it when it was launched commercially, we took a chance. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what the people behind the image possessed to move forward with "Rent-a-Cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. It seems that this movie was shot in a big way. This movie does not add anything new to its genre. It is totally predictable, since once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or maybe the address Jerry London gave him, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has an expression throughout the film. It simply does not register any emotion. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, as the prostitute who witnessed the original massacre at the Chicago hotel, does not make any sense. The romance between her Della and the Church seems false from the start. She and Mr. Reynolds interpret one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this turkey.
