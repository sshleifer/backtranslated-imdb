A cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To return him to civilization, he bribes in the cargo hold of a large luxury cruise with something funny and I think the script had disastrous results. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the one thing that I really did not like about this movie ... The monster really looked like a guy in a rubber suit. The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. Well, that's out of my chest now in all the nice aspects of this B movie. <br /> <br /> The best was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter, the sweet one's eyes a second). John was intermittently funny and gentle and No matter what the writers had him say, he said it well. Good job given what I had to do. The cyptozoologist was too funny and fun to watch, he also had some funny snippets. All the marines were good and they were good. Cannon fodder for the monster as some crew members and guests did. There are some very funny lines in this movie, and a pretty funny sub-plot that involves a thief. <br /> <br /> The special effects are usually low med and I swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the film. I liked the gore of the man without legs. Actually, since this movie was not scary at all, I think that a little more gore would have made much progress in improving the visualization capacity of this movie. <br /> <br /> In general If you like monsters B, it's worth a visit.
