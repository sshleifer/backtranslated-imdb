After 30 minutes ... the fastest forwarding, I deleted it from my recorder. The first movie of the Critters was consciously funny, the "conversation" between the critters just before the grandmother dragged them from the porch, for example. This movie simply moves forward, waiting for someone to film it and take it out of your misery. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that anyone who has worked on this turkey is proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four was just horrible. Do not get upset, even if the alternative is to watch the reruns of a TBS 700 Club fundraiser, at least you'll get good laughs there (and the "extraterrestrial" makeup is more credible ... great).
