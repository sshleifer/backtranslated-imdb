The worst part of all is the bad script, which leads to a superficial performance. <br /> <br /> The character of Dreyfuss is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss has an annoying face to match. <br /> <br /> The character of Holly Hunter is exaggeratedly self-centered, and Hunter herself commits to serious overacting, as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was made of wood. John Goodman did the best he could. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole death / ghost issue has been exaggerated a bit, and now it seems pretty lame. <br /> <br /> You can barely see if you like old planes.
