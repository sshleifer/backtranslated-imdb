More: Mary Boland is delighted as always (I never tire of her craziness from the top of the bark, especially in "Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). BATHROOM. Fields' brief role is fun, although the famous pool table scene extends the welcome because it seems to last ten minutes. The crazy antics of the film, typical of the time, are great. Also, a nod to the wonderfully punished housewife of Alison Skipworth; I would love to see more of her (reminds me of Marie Dressler, another personality worthy of great praise). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Gracie Allen. An irritating and unattractive presence whose annoyance was unparalleled until the rise of Adam Sandler. That almost falsetto nose tinged with an accent of unknown origin ages in its first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen movies I've seen, and while (as a big fan of classical comedy) I try to experience at least one movie with each comedy star, this is definitely a team I will not return to appeal. His time and interpretation of the material is totally out of place. A maddeningly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: an acceptable comedy, but the gags are few and far between. And with only an hour of duration, you can expect this to not be a grade A Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
