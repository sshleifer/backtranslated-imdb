I saw this movie mistakenly thinking it was the zombie movie of another radio station. The low values ​​of production and the low income distribution soon revealed that this was another of those "knock offs" of the cheap sci-fi channel style. <br /> <br /> The central performance of Bill Moseley is initially quite attractive as the dubious Radio shock jock, but as the film progresses he becomes less and less convincing, as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast has nothing to do but look worried and has no depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is boring, flat and completely uninspired, like many of these movies. It does not even achieve a convincing bit of gore, the makeup of the zombies is literally pathetic, apart from a notable exception towards the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film tries to inject originality and a message on it is a mixture of half-baked ideas and ripped apart by somehow matching this outbreak with intolerance towards Islam and the war against terrorism. This is unfortunately handled with all the intellectual influence of a 6-year-old child. As the characters and apparently the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion, describing all people of a certain skin color as "Muslims". In particular, it is revealed that a character is Muslim only because of his skin color. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists that cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Presumably, the far superior Pontypool had a budget similar to that of Dead Air, but it shines everywhere where this movie fails miserably.
