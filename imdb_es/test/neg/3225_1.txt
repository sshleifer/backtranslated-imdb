What happened to Mathew Modine's career? I can still remember when he was considered an actor on the A list ... <br /> <br /> Was the ruthless island the last nail in the coffin of a race that was once promising? wow, this guy really must hate the insides of Renny Harlin ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be a comedy, but it can not laugh, the characters are cartoons and are badly drawn in that ... but what What hurts me the most is to see Mr. Modine assume these kinds of roles, along with the actors so far from his caliber, I mean, when he was making films like BIRDIE, he could never in his worst nightmares. He imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a penis humping a cow that just had its anus clamped, and maybe the worst, next to Elizabeth Berkley!
