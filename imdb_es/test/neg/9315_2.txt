Historical films always take liberties: conversations are invented where nobody could really know what was said, the customs are adjusted to be understandable to the modern public, etc. However, historical films about real historical figures should at least make a minimal nod to the story. This movie does not do it. The only scene I remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who slips into his room at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with "I do not remember sending the service to the room". The main value of entertainment is in its evilness; I recommended that my local video put it on the "Pavos" shelf.
