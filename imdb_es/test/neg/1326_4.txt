Do people rate this movie highly because it is a foreign war movie? For me, it's just a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad at so many levels Even mentioning it together with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle sequences are pathetic, dialogue and atrocious action. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "stormtroopers" are regular in the Wermacht. No SS troops. There is a lot of evil with this movie that is sad. Bad editing, bad acting. Has it all. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on and on and on as if the audience should suffer as much as the soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that the movie had a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> Really? Where was it spent? In the fake train car sequences? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> As a fan of World War II history and a fan of the World War II movie, I found this movie a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie, check out "The Beast". (It's not a World War II movie, but it's still exceptional) <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this one.
