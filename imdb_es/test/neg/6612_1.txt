This movie is TRASH from the word go. First, it tells of a season that took place 16 YEARS ago. Who cares? This movie had the same depth as a bottle cap. It makes a complex person like Bob Knight become a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Judging does not bother me, but I'm still surprised that ESPN has shown a film with more curses than a Kevin Smith movie in a basic role. cable channel. The word F was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial cut. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible and anyone related to it should feel ashamed. I rate this on the same level as Jaws IV: The Revenge and Everybody Wins ... 2 films that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
