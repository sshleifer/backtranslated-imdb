... when we all know, nobody does it like the BBC. <br /> <br /> Being an avid fan of this kind of observation on Sunday night, I really wanted to do it. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds I did not think it looked promising and after two minutes it was hard for me to see it. <br /> <br /> However, my friends and I just insisted on finding bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of Half of the characters. The plot rushed to the extreme and the eye-catching and very 21st century makeup and costumes in a "bbc robin hood" style. This modern style could have been placed inside sharp camera angles and a visually sumptuous cinematography, but unfortunately we did not get any. The management felt decidedly careless for both the performance and the choice of shot. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes we could not see it and we went out and rented 'The Prestige' (which is very good indeed) Maybe it is unfair that I judge this because I have seen very little of this, but rarely I felt so obliged to warn people not to see anything. However, my friends and I thought that the house and the umbrellas were nice, but that's for the best.
