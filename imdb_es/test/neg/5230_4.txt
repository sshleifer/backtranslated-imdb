STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** The Works **** Simply miss the mark *** Little Bit In Between ** Lagged behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Based on another of Stephen's long novels King, This takes place in the small town of Castle Rock (also the name of the movie's producer!), Where a new antique store was opened, the title Needful Things. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, one might say, a diabolical secret. There is an item in your store that everyone in the small town wants: first a small cash price is required in advance, before asking for a much more sinister price. As suspicion, hatred and madness destroy the city, it falls to the police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from a terrifying end ... <br /> <br /> I read Needful's novel Things earlier this year, and I was eager to see the movie adaptation again to compare them (so it would be a contest!) but it was deleted on video and DVD and I could not find any place to rent it. So I was glad when I finally found it at a flea market on a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the cruelest ironies that King's novels are generally the best to read, but when they adapt to them. screen nine times out of ten are complete garbage, as is the case here. The material that makes your books great simply does not translate very well into a movie script, for some reason. And I suppose there's always a question: why bother seeing this when I could be reading the book again? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are simply too long (ie, It, The Stand) to turn them into a full-screen job with all the situations and characters included, but there's no reason why this is not has included. All the material of the book. As a result, many of the key characters in the book (ie, Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have terrible character development, which means that we do not care about the characters involved, as they are so stripped of depth and motivation. : for example, we have a character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who murders his wife towards the end, but we were not shown any accumulation to realize that he did not get along with her or hated her, and that's why it has no impact when it happens, unlike the book in which you invested a lot of depth and really involved you to discover what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the script to fill in the cracks, if you wish, is really stupid and cheesy and the typically ridiculous things that are included in King's adaptations like this one. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's problems are that it strays so far away from the book, but there is also a terrible performance by a cast who, obviously, can not feel the silly material that they are being asked to perform . In the 90s, many of King's works began to skip the cinema and became a territory made for TV / video. Garbage like this surely must allude to why. **
