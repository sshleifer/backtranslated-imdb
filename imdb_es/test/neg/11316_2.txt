Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically critical films like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Acused"). So, the fact that you are hitting "Mr. Magoo" should show that it is a piece of garbage. Summons Nielsen as the myopic title character, something is planted in him, and messes up everything. It seems that Nielsen's combo and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's films) would make this fun movie, but it's not like that; It seems that they only have people to do anything, and here there is no real humor. <br /> <br /> So, the original caricature with Jim Backus that provided the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; You probably do not want to emphasize this piece of junk in your careers.
