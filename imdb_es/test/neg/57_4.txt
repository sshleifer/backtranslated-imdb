In general I do not make negative comments here. But since this is a piece of the festival, I do not want you to waste your time when you can see something else that may not play again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not face each other, but waited to RECITATE their lines, which were quite poor to begin with. The dialogue sounded really forced. Norman or whatever his name is called, or so it seems, to be witty and biting in the lines he chose, but he was very short. <br /> <br /> After the words, he asked if anyone saw the end coming and some people were all "yes", and he almost called them liars. Look, there were so many clues, the biggest one is a briefcase full of money for a whore of $ 500 per hour. I mean, John gave him at least 20 g's ... a story sign. Not now, you could not see exactly what was going to happen, but the moment the torsion occurred, I did not care. I was glad to get out of there. I asked him what draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait to shoot until 15.3 because this required a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed like a pretty nice guy, he is. making his own films, he will probably improve and I hope he does, not in a way too silly, I mean it, I wish him good luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion.
