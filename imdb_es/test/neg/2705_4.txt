I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This presented all three of these ... but I did not like this movie. It just lasted too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in photography with some low-angle shots. However, it seemed to me that it took me six hours to get to that point, and I really can not say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact, it was comforting to see De Havilland actually supporting Flynn instead of his normal role as antagonist to him. However, something is missing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticism for many other films that have done the same. In fact, it is RARE when a film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist history offended most of the critics. If the movie had made General Custer much worse than it really was, they probably would have liked it. Good, very bad. In its twisted form, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I had enjoyed this more, but I will take many other Flynn adventures on this one.
