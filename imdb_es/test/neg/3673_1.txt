This is, by far, the worst movie I've seen in my life, almost without a plot, and the plot is very scattered. The storyline lacks content, suspense and subtitles, since what appears to be the story line is in Russian. The whole seems to be just a room with various lighting effects and the moment you think something good is about to happen, you feel disappointed by the total lack of acting, drama, suspense, horror, gore, history and mythology. The direction style has been done to death (the fish eye camera). It seems that the only action in this movie is within the last 10 to 15 minutes and the action is aggravated by the inability of the actors to correctly portray the suspense. The only interesting thing about this movie was that my dog ​​was barking at the surround sound.
