This movie could have been a decent reshuffle, and God knows he tried (or tried Mrs. English). Gathering talented actors together with a successful and experienced writer / director should be a formula for a decent movie. But the experience of Mrs. English, according to her biography of IMDb, is limited exclusively to television work, and is very evident throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that none of the reviews I've read mention what I've read. He found very unpleasant about this movie, and what prevented him from reaching even a part of his potential: he looked and was made for television. To give Mrs. English some credit, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been fantastic on television (and maybe a laugh song would have helped). Much of the use of the camera and lighting would have worked well on television, but they looked uncomfortable or strange on a large screen. If the whole movie had been divided into a miniseries or a sitcom, I think it might have worked. But this is cinema and, unfortunately, the talent of Mrs. English was not translated. I was embarrassed by so many different points in my shame for the actors and writers that I felt I left the theater half-cramped. Meg Ryan is her cheerful and sympathetic personality (except for the horrible plastic surgery she had on her face), but where did she have the opportunity to use her talent? She has made films in which she does not recreate her stereo type role and she has done them well ... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the movements: such a great talent and, nevertheless, such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other female characters, but they were more caricatures than substance, and it was sad to see them. What worked in this movie in the 1930s does not translate into the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English to correctly understand the changes and updates or the subtleties. If only she (as writer, director and producer) had asked for help, I think it could have been good. But it was not. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating to go see a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director, and in the end it feels like it was a waste of time and money for everyone. This caricature of the New Yorker that I saw yesterday is appropriate: some film executives have a meeting and the legend says: "Let's redo a classic with everything worse!"
