All right!! The movie has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark television movie. It's from a novel by Thomas Hardy. He has Catherine Zeta Jones in her. She is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes, he has Clive Owen in it. I'm not British, so that means almost as much as being a novel by Thomas Hardy. Except that he was in "The Bourne Identity", and I liked that. That almost envelops everything, people. That really everything there was. I'm getting repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I stayed until the end. The computer tells me that I do not have 10 lines and I keep telling them. I always count 11, but maybe I do not like my style, but that's also my opinion about the movie.
