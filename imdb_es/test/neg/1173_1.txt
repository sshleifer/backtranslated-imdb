I made a review for the fictional recreation of this director on BTK. I had also seen this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This movie was terrible and this director has no talent. I do not understand how he is financing these films. They are horrible. I have decided to make sure to verify who is the writer, the director and the producer, and if the name of this director appears, I will not waste my money. There's nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night, making popcorn and then realizing that you've been tricked by the creative art in the front of the movie box. Keep away. So, I guess I should invent some things to complete the lines? I have always reviewed the opinions of IMDb before, but I think I will not do it anymore. This is ridiculous. They have corrected me in my comments too many times. There are not enough lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
