In no case watch this movie. It is terrible for several reasons: <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No address No action to talk about No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <Br /> <br /> The best of all is the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85mins could feel so long. <br /> <br /> Once again: under no circumstances watch this movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> No plot No structure No direction No need to talk about No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. <br /> <br /> The best of all is the box and the fact that it eventually ends. Who would have thought that 85mins could feel so much time.
