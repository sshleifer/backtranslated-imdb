As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underestimated) I have to boo this movie. If you can not know who did it and why in the first half hour, obviously, you have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or you have never seen 20/20. It's like the filmmakers and the actors did not care how they filmed it and how they played the characters, it would be a real gift. <br /> <br /> In general, this film serves to ignite the dirty Perverts who like to mix violence and sex. It's not a fun movie to sit in, although if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see her in her place as a tough lady.
