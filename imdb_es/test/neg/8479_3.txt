This movie is not worth going to theaters to see, I liked it and I did not like it, the effects on the movie are very well done, and you laugh from time to time, but the story is very bad. it seemed that they had run out of ideas, and what is that about loki and odin getting along? That totally destroys the Norse mythology, and I suppose they forgot that the loki powers only worked during NIGHT! If you really MUST see this movie renting it when it comes out, do not go to the movies for this! <br /> <br /> They could have done a lot more with this than they did, it felt like they just wanted to make a movie to show great animations and effects
