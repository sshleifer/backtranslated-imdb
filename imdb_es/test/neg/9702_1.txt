I think it's something that says Bollywood's "Bride and PRejudice" stayed more faithful to the original material than this 2005 version of Hollywood. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? It's priceless!) If you've read the book or seen the BBC version of 1995 (and liked it), you'll come across an unpleasant surprise when you go to this movie. However, my friend, who had not seen either, was slightly amused by the movie. However, if you are a purist of JAne Austen, or even a movie buff who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine that the actors would not have done so badly if they had had a decent script, perhaps written by someone who really loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> What farces were committed? Well, you will be forced to endure such incredulous lines as "Do not you dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone for once in your lives!" These lines are not only far from anything that may come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like those that come out of the mouth of a young Gentile of the Regency era? The use of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways in which the writer destroys the book. The writer also decided to give lines of characters that, in the book, said completely different characters and all without any apparent purpose. And what's worse, when they try to get a little closer to the writing of the book, the scriptwriter has the unpleasant and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's sentences and substituting uncomfortable synonyms for his already perfect words. It was as if the scriptwriter sat with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Adhere to Austen's words; He did better than you! I guess all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic version of the 1995 BBC. However, for me, it also made a parody of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work . <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, although it was quickly eliminated once the script was activated. But Keira, laughing nervously. Exaggerating and undressing your crooked teeth is not just charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I consider him quite handsome enough, misinterpreted his script and had the impression that he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. His interpretations were really quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as a bum who had accidentally gotten on the set of the movie and I must say it is a proper description. And can someone tell me why they created Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the movie less than two minutes, I would dare say, and without his impressive archery skills to animate the film. <br /> <br /> On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit more into the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening dress? Please! More versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they finally caught the bastard who stole the only brush from the set of the movie. Unfortunately, they did not catch him soon enough to comb the braids of the actresses before filming the shoot. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new version of Hollywood, goodbye to the eloquence, subtlety and ingenuity of Austen because you get the opposite.
