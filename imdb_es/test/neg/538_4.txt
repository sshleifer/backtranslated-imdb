It is perfectly fine for people to die in an animation, but in this there are too many deaths. Starting from the beginning, history is all battles, fights, death and revenge. Go on and on for an hour and a half. It was interesting at first, but I got very tired after the show was halfway there. Unlike other animations, this is a lack of humor. Nor are there many interactions between the characters. The good thing about this is that the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look good.
