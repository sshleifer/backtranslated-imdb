It is always interesting to watch a horror movie after hearing so many compliments from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan tastes within a genre. My expectations of this movie were much higher than those of my opinion. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with dead things is a movie with a well-intentioned plot that is triggered many times to carry it out. The idea that a band of actors represented a reanimation of corpses intrigued me. However, everything degenerated into a cinematic chaos. The actors, who for the most part were competent and surprisingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain a consistent characterization. Some of these characters range from ambivalence about the whole act of desecrating a cemetery, to open criticism, back to ambivalence. One thing is that the characters have a heart of change in the course of the film; it is another to produce a too dynamic circular attitude that repeats itself every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another inconsistent element of this movie is the premise. Does the main character pretend that the ceremony is a theatrical joke or actually conspires with dark spiritual forces to resurrect the dead? Even with the aforementioned flaws, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since I believe that only true fans of horror will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and ignore the inconsistency of the plot. The scene in which the dead rise from the grave becomes extremely disturbing (even for an enthusiast of veteran zombies) for the excellent combined use of landscapes and sound, and the large selection of expert actors chosen to play the reanimated dead . Current filmmakers must learn from CSPWDT about the use of appropriate audio and video techniques for mood development. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are a finalist in the zombie movie like me, you should take some time to locate and watch this movie. It's a fun watch.
