Well, the Cannes artyfartyrati may have liked this movie, but I'm afraid not me. If you like the type of film in which the shots are prolonged for so long that you wonder if the actor has fallen asleep or if the cameraman went to lunch, then it may be for you. A large part of this is so, with brief stays in the realm of the unpleasant. It did not seem shocking or disturbing to me as other reviewers have done, just a little unpleasant and useless. The only reason I did not give this star is that the performance is recommended and that the movie is pretty well filmed. The plot, however, has little to recommend. A large part of the film only shows a grumpy woman who teaches or listens to the piano, which could attract some people. But so you do not think this is harmless, get ready for some fragments of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
