I went to see this movie about Matchstick Men, in fact, buying tickets for Matchstick Men and going to the other, because it seemed like a fun movie with action, romance, emotions, jungles and exotic places. They had all that, but also many films with a conception of history. <br /> <br /> All I can say is WHY WHY WHY WHY they did not just do a direct storytelling instead of a sappy flashback story. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies I've seen that were derived: of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, that old 80's movie by Tom Selleck . , Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero (for the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS: the only scene in the movie that was great is when the central character finds his room exploded.
