If you can overcome this movie without laughing out loud on the screen, you are a better spectator than me. <br /> <br /> Count the logical lapses, the common sense jumps and the credibility stretches ... More than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: if one more film uses a location that is clearly UCLA and states that it is a different university (in the case of this film: Berkeley), I will lose that.
