This movie has to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst I've seen in my life. It was not even a bad b movie ... I would have qualified it as a z. The special effects were ridiculous ... err if we could even call them special effects. I think the critic before hitting the nail in the head ... was the box that sold the film, while the art of the cover was excellent and the synopsis was intriguing (which is the reason why the rent) was A waste of time not only But also money. I did not last long. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another movie. I think my local video store took it off the shelf because they had so many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old son could have done a better job of filming / writing the script!
