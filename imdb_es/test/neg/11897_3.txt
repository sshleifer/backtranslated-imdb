One would think that anyone embarking on a follow-up to the innovative naked public servant more than 30 years ago would at least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a kind of biographical film of one of the most stylish people of the late twentieth century who does not present any style. It is true that the filmmakers have brought together some outstanding actors, and gave them a chipped cup of porridge to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the script, which is another one of those condensations of television movies of great lives in which every other line is a "famous quote" of the subject and every other scene is one in its inside. Introduction to the face of the next fundamental character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a public relations expert who promotes Crisp as an entertainment artist in the United States; Denis O'Hare, the editor of a gay newspaper that hires Crisp as a film critic, steps away from him when he is indifferent to the passions of the AIDS activists of the 1980s, and then returns to the fold as a friend. compassionate of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in an excellent performance) as a shy and insecure gay-themed canvas painter who became friends with Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by the person of Crisp, offers her a place in her cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and talented performer, but the script does not give him the chance to embody the land and the street arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-bedroom apartment in an old apartment building in the East Village of Manhattan. He famously said he never cleaned because "after a few years, the dust does not get worse," or something like that. But seeing the representation of that floor in this movie you would never get the taste of that dust. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and was seen almost every day of the week drinking tea and watching the world go by. In this movie we have a restaurant that looks something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the scenes of "New York streets" have a sterile and unreal aspect without a sense of the time. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is the great John Hurt in the lead role. After almost 35 years, you can still capture the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian English and pass it on to the third millennia. Each of its lines, each gesture is exquisite. In later scenes, he even modulates his vocal projection to fit that of a person whose life is shrinking to death. Crisp wrote shortly before leaving this kingdom that when one grows very, the skin of the elderly takes on the character of a malodorous coat that can not be removed and one longs for death. One feels that sensation in Hurt's performance. Therefore, for him and for him alone this movie is worth seeing.
