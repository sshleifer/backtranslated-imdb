I must have been in a good mood to give this film embarrassing, predictable and embarrassing, even a 3. What's wrong? Let's start with free sex, although I admit that the rotating style of bonking was something I had not seen (or experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few dollars by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green area of ​​any city it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario?) However, in the scenes on the roof, it seems to be in an industrial area with a steel mill belching smoke and flames. In addition, the interior of the building, the newsroom, the stairs, seem much larger than the outside. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid reporter is finally fired, she returns to the building several times, once after hours. Unlikely. The ending is also unfortunately predictable ... the classic bait and the change of capers in which the good man turns out to be the bad man. But my main objection is the fact that this is another film financed with Canadian and Ontario tax credits that is ashamed to settle in Canada, proving once again that the Canadian film industry is crazy and opportunistic. The films of a country must do more than just provide jobs. They must reflect the culture. It is bad enough that American studios use Toronto as an alternative for New York. But it is embarrassing and annoying when the Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do so with the help of the federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
