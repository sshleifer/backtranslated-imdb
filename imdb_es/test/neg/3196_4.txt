I saw a big clip of this movie, which I'll talk about later, and then the list of actors, and I thought it would be better to give it a try. Basically, Randy (Matt Dillon), his arrogant bartender, his cocky cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and Detective Dehling (John Goodman) have something in common, they've seen the girl of their dreams. (married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, they would even die. The three met / saw "one night at McCool's", the bar where Randy worked, do not know each other, but all three can not stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Lord of the Rings, Liv Tyler). The three are telling their stories to someone they expect to hear their stories quite intense and revealing, Randy talks to the hitman Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film), Carl with the psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba McEntire) and Dehling to priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they have been willing to do, their sexual contact with her and, finally, they meet in one place, with the intention of being with her and all those involved in the final shooting that leaves one dead, one fleeing (and finally dying) and a dazed, and the unexpected boy who chooses (but at the same time it's obvious, because he's obsessed with Douglas's sex). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to choose a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned in number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke in The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copies the woman who is washing the car with foam all over her, and in front of Goodman , very sexy! Apart from that, it is not the most memorable movie. Good!
