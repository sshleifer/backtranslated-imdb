I mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the Buffalo area - Niagara Falls might be something different. Unfortunately I was wrong. There are many problems with "The Falls", which really have nothing to do with their production of low budget videos. Immediately you have to ask yourself why all the constant narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow it, without having to be insulted with the voice over the narration. The acting is very amateur, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing was filmed in an annoying way like an MTV music video, which I found totally unacceptable. The narration, the bad acting and the annoying effects of video are good reasons to avoid it. - MERK
