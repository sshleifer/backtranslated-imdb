Wow, Kiss the Bride was not that bad, but it was not that good either. Surely there were no "Saints of the day after". The movie sinks in the middle ... maybe cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a movie more enjoyable. But the film is stuck again and again by the annoying subplots and the disposable scenes: the whole sequence of gold output comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was created for a theatrical premiere, it looks and sounds more like a movie made for television. Each scene is lit like a department store. So many characters are so discarded. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is actually a pleasant surprise. She steals each scene in which it appears. <br /> <br /> A scene really bothered me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with dozens of tables, all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where did everyone go? <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has sunk to a new low ... but not as low as the horrible movies that are being produced and exhibited in the Here! Channel.
