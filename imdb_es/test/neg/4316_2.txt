About the spoiler warning? It is not "can contain", but contains spoilers. Readers be careful. <br /> <br /> Well, first I need to know that I am not attacking the actors. They are only working with what they are given. The problem was the script. It was horrible. There was nothing credible about it at all. Of course, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there is going to be a serious mistake here and there that puts you in a horribly horrible situation worthy of a movie. But these girls just made stupid decisions after stupid decisions. The only girl smart enough to try to call the police was the girl added towards the end because she had already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her with a car ... why the hell did she try to escape from a truck instead of running to the side like a normal person? Besides, whoever wrote the honest script to God believes that the cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? Frankly, it was not suspense either. The only suspense I felt was the frustration of how late the girls were. Well, this tirade has lasted much longer than I thought for such a bad movie, so I will not bother to play the ending, besides the fact that it is unrealistic and unconvincing.
