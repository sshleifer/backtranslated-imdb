******** SPOILER ALERT ************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this "movie". First of all, we think it's very funny that the producer appeared in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible incredibly incredible accent. What the hell was that, Romanian? And how is it that in Denmark nobody speaks Danish except the creatures of the swamp? (Note, the director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who does the shopping for the swamp creatures? His pants seemed to have been bought at Banana Republic. Very well dressed to be 1200 years old. This was worse than the Scarecrow Slayer (we did not think it was even POSSIBLE). Basically we move quickly through 75% of the movie in search of any bloody moment / death / fear. Nothing found. Rent the DVD only to watch the 2-hour piece "Behind the scenes of the swamp creatures". Who are these people? They're serious? And the filmmakers are about 60 years old. I think this is his holy grail and that is quite pathetic in itself. <br /> <br /> The BEST LINE of the film, clearly: "Not bad for a girl who never went to graduate school ..." My grandmother blinds that she has Alzheimer's could make a better movie.
