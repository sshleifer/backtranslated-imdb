What a horrible movie. Filled with clich√©s, disconcerting scenes, very bad acting and an atrocious script. It's hard to believe that the same guys who wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. This guy, this director, if you can call him that, realized that the first problem child was bad enough? And much less make a sequel for it! Incredible that you can show children trash movies like this and much less be released! 1 out of 10 * 's
