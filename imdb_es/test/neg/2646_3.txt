Although this was a well told story, I found it very unpleasant. The main theme is child abuse, which is never fun to watch, a sordid subject. Add to that a lot of blasphemy on the part of the abuser-drunk husband and a GD of a small child, nothing less, and this movie has diverted me so much that I can see her again. <br /> <br /> Here also the punks that get into with the two small children are portrayed, another unpleasant visual experience. The realism of history is submerged when one of the boys flies on a homemade plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive and pleasant part of this film is to see the pleasant, loving and moving relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter became a familiar face in the next two years with great roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Wood, of course, did not make it big until a decade later, but he made it very big in the trilogy In The Lord Of The Rings. Those two children, and Tom Hanks' unbilled narration, are the only facets of this movie that I liked.
