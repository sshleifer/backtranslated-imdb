I saw this movie right in the middle while going through a break. It was about 3 in the morning and I was fighting insomnia with a quick sandwich. It was not so bad at that time, but every time I try to see it since then, I can not get into it like I did that night. <br /> <br /> At that time I thought it was cute and I loved the variety of characters, although, in my opinion, they could have done better than Goran V. But the only thing that kept me looking was the character of Heather and her sad "commitment" to her husband who no longer wanted her, which made me feel sorry for her and encourage her at the same time. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at that time, maybe that's why I liked it so much.) It's not a bad movie, but you have to be close to a romantic character to appreciate it, and hopefully you never are.
