'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the minor novels of Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very turgid novel years ago, but I could not finish it. I will review this version of the film solely on its own merits, since I do not know how faithfully the original novel follows. <br /> <br /> The opening credits of the film are printed in an old English font that suggests medieval style. period, so it is a very bad choice for a movie with a 19th century scenario. (On the other hand, roughly halfway through the film, we see a close-up picture of a prospect announcing an asset auction, this brochure is set in authentic Victorian sources and seems * very * convincing). Most of this film is extremely convincing in its representation of architecture and dress of the early nineteenth century in England. The exact location of the story of this film is never revealed, but, judging by the accents of the actors, it would place it as somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot, what there is of it, implies a mill that changes hands a couple of times (for a couple of decades) between two rival families, one rich and one working class. I do not agree with another IMDb critic who claims that James Mason only has a small role in this movie. Mason has the most important and central role in this drama, as the offspring of the richest family. Like the spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is somber and impetuous. His performance here belongs to a better movie: it made me want to see the version of 'Wuthering Heights' with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> As this is a multigenerational saga (something that George Eliot did much better in 'Middlemarch'), several of the main roles in this film are divided between two actors: children's actors in the prologue, adults in the main narrative. The prologue of this film presents a well-written scene, which establishes Tom Tulliver as willful and harassing from a young age, and the young Philip Wakeham as decent and considerate. During the hard work, Philip has earned half a cent: Tom tries to harass him away from him, but he is not willing to take the coin by brute force: he wants Philip to give it to him. All the children's actors in this film, men and women, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all children speak their dialogue with elegant soft-spoken accents that are completely different from the accents of actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This discrepancy draws attention to the sealing of the material. Unfortunately, none of the subsequent scenes is as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The climax shows a crowd of workers in a storm, much better and more photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (at least in Britain) can no longer take this kind of material seriously. At this time, practically all British comedians have done a comedy routine "problem at t 'mill, squire", parodying precisely this theme, so I had difficulty seeing this movie with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The character The actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the opening credits (in that type of letter in old English) misspell her name as "Marita". I will rate this boring movie 3 points out of 10: one point each for the performance of James Mason, the initial scene with the children and the authentic Victorian typography in the prospect of the auctioneer.
