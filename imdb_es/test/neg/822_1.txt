Do not tell me this movie was fun or a little funny. It was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Ali G is just funny on Ali G Show on Channel 4. After watching his performance, all I can say is that it's not made for movies. With a Daft script, or more like no story, there's nothing to keep it entertained. Filled with annoying and unreal characters, this movie is a complete garbage at all times. At the end of the film, Ali G gives a speech. Mention, if you hated this movie, tell people that it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie. I probably knew it was going to be a bad smell. I would have given a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. In general, do not even waste your time on this garbage.
