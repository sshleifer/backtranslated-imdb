A tedious effort of not so great director Budd Boetticher and the beautiful but not yet insipid actress Nina Foch, this film is, as another criticism points out, the quintessence of a certain type of film B. It's just not the good guy. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine are wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic plot: Nina, a war leave nurse because of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a handsome fellow at the resort where she relaxes her nerves and realizes that she is in the dream, even though she had never seen him before. Meanwhile, it turns out that our corpulent man is working as a spy, and is about to undertake a secret and secret mission that should not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are Nazis. And draw holes. And smart people who act more likely to become totally unnecessary scrapes, so that the execution time can extend beyond an hour. In the end, the film becomes a contest between which a group of spies can act more foolishly. If the FBI and the OSS had acted like this team, we would have lost the war in 42. <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot quite flat (despite the best efforts of the fog machine ) and acting - as it seems that in many of the Columbia Bs that TCM has been showing lately - curiously it is not compromised. It's less stylized than one might find in a Warner Bros movie with a similar budget, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The strength of Boetticher, of course, is a quite natural style that allows for strong stories and acting in his westerns Scott Randolph to come to the fore. Maybe the problem here is that that style will not work when the script is lousy and the actors get tired of their program of five films per year.
