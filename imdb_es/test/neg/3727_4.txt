Okay, if I was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth three dollars for rent, I would have to say no. The plot was implausible. I came to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves can not act. Sometimes, it can be painful to watch (although my wife thinks it's cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is generally great) was even a bit disappointing as the crooked policeman. On the positive side, the plot (because it is unlikely) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
