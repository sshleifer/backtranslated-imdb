Okay, if you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to simulate movies, you'll have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it can be too painful to see it. <br /> <br /> Plot: The obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge box containing a Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently does not have to declare it at customs, or even mention that he is bringing aboard a live animal: "No, it's really a research team, the air holes are just an accident"). Some rods that he hired to open the box, thinking he paid lots of money, maybe there's something to steal. Once the CROADO DE MADERA is open, the Chupacabra goes through the STEEL BARS inside and launches into the deadly uproar. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> By a stroke of pure coincidence, a Marshall (I assume that a Marshall of the United States, since he was in the Gulf War, not just a guy named Marshall) is on board, investigating a little of money that disappeared from the safe of the ship. He pretends to be an insurance salesman ("Ma'am, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other dazzling characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film), his daughter instructor of tae-bo (snicker - Tae-bo), an annoying old woman with a small dog. What should a cat be fed (guess WHAT he eats it ...?) And an incredibly nasty gigolo who could have been credible in a 1964 movie, not in anything more recent. A lot of the acting was really bad, and the characters were there so you could laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> In general, very badly. Bad on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What??? The bullets do not even make Chupacabra flicker, but can Tae-bo's bimbo hit him and scare him? Hello, science fiction channel, are you desperate for scripts or what?
