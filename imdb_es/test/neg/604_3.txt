In short, this movie was disappointing and could have been reduced by twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was unsatisfactory, the only decent actors in the group are Trisha, the killer and Molly. The music was a bit loose but appropriate and the special effects were too overused. Story / script writing was deficient, unnecessary tortures / romantic scenes dragged on for too long and a disappointing end. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie was quite slow, the fake-looking gake is not too important. interest. Trisha came to the house, and there was a certain premise for a good story. <br /> <br /> Trisha began receiving threatening phone calls, which increased the suspense. This momentary suspense, the best feature of the film began to be built, but then the friends crashed on the spot, destroying all potential suspense / horror in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot becomes obtuse from now on. The chemistry shines between the two couples, and then the killer takes Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The killer makes her way to Trisha and binds her. There is an exaggerated torture scene that lasts for at least ten minutes. Because blood is poorly made, this is not at all entertaining, and is more than a shock. <br /> <br /> In short, the first thirty minutes of this movie sound promising but then a poorly written dialogue and a general lack of plot ruins this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
