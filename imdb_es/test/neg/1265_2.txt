I came across a rare copy of this early film by Almodóvar with great expectations: Almodóvar is a prolific contemporary director. I enjoyed his 1988 film "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," and had read one or two very positive reviews of the movie. Well, I must have completely lost the humor that critics saw in this movie. I just found it incoherent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are a lot of hints, people in danger and raw sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have impacted the audiences in 1982 (which was surely the intention of Almodóvar), but much of the value of the shock has probably been eroded over the years leaving a frame of lameness. Beyond that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy", even a dark one, I just did not find this movie funny. I guess it's possible that there is a VERY select audience for a movie like this, but I'm just not part of that audience and I'm not sure I want to be.
