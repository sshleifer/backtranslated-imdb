Lazy writing, poor performance and direction of the wood lead us to a 2005 television movie made in Canada called HUSH, which should not be confused with eight other films that use the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor's husband move from SanFran to their small hometown, where they meet their old friend, who decides that she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Tori's baby (do not ask) and starts hitting anyone who gets in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame. It is not worth mentioning the actors who play the old friend and the doctor, since they act more flat than flat. Tori is not much better, but at least she is something to focus on as the plot snakes here and there before arriving at a very unconvincing and overly familiar conclusion. Look instead at the HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.
