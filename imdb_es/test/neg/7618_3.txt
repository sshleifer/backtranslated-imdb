Once I saw a bit of this movie, and I was interested to see everything to see why the critics give it two stars, and the result is that I agree. Basically, the film begins when Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) tells all his Muppet buddies that they have lost everything, and ends up sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) at the bank. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven), the angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been to Muppets from Space) visits the 'Boss' (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason why he wanted to see the movie) to prove that Kermit really needs help. In the flashbacks, it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and best Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets who have prepared a theatrical show for many people to see on the Christmas holidays, and everything seems to be going well. But the truth is that Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to close the show or the theater, and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that does not happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time, and Bitterman tells her they're done, and she can officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood and finally ends up saying "I wish I had never been born". Obviously, you can recognize the parody of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as George Bailey, and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, obviously Kermit realizes how much it means to everyone, and goes back to find the theater. Saved as a historic landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character that sounds similar to Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the parody of Moulin Rouge, besides that and the familiar faces in it, not fantastic. He was nominated for an Emmy for Best Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters." The Muppets were number 47 in The 100 best icons of pop culture. Suitable!
