If the movies in which the virtual reality characters come alive and they are all hard or masculine men or a feminine eye candy sound good to you, maybe this movie is not a total waste of film. It goes without saying that the vast majority of people will find that this is an absolute bore, with little talent to act, and even less with a script. Yes, it's good to look at Athena Massey, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
