I just finished watching this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It was so boring that I found myself zooming at the speed of X2 and finished in less than 30 minutes. Not only was I disappointed, but I got angry for having wasted my money to rent it. It ranks in the top five of the worst movies I've seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I had not read the cover of the DVD before renting it, I would have been totally lost in this movie. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins, after making films as good as "Shawshank Redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.
