But to be a little more precise, I do not think it's as bad as it could be. Although the actors (famous to the semi-famous) did not do a great job. Guilt of the directors? Could the script also be difficult to say? Anyway, if you are looking for many great weapons and action, this is not the movie for you, but they do run with many vintage ww2 weapons. More or less funny :) Well, I think I could say more, but it does not feel like it's worth it. If you are desperate enough or if a Hackman monster sees it, otherwise no! <br /> <br /> Live well and prosper
