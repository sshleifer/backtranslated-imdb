I should have known better ... the clues were on IMDB.com. This movie was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. The cast is a group of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Est√©vez, who seems to specialize in bad films. Etc. Suffice it to say that I do not see any reason why anyone would want to see this horrible attempt at amateur filming. Turn on any transmission channel at 3 am and you will see better movies. Nuff said.
