Dark Reality is a Saw type movie that is slightly decrepit. While the plot and the story are good, there is too much unnecessary nudity. Although I think the film was technically well done, the performance was irregular, it was too dark for my mood while I was watching it. Basically, he says that there are many missing people out there that will never be found and maybe they are being tortured by crazy people. I feel that some information about the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. It emerged as a snuff film, made only for violent content. If you like to see women beaten, tortured and killed, then this is for you. If you are looking for something a little more liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
