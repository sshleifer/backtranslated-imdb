SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will ruin the afternoon or "few hours in the morning" viewing time. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He has portrayed good characters in the roles I have seen. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising film soon disappears on its own with the disastrous background and extreme closeness of the person who is about to die ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> Describe it as a hammy performance would insult the pigs. This movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and eliminates the performance there. <br /> <br /> Apart from the excessive cooking of Marc Singer, Mike Dopud stomps and walks through the landscape as if he fears he might fall on the rocks and his big-eyed 'maniac' bad guy just makes it look like a fool. It is not threatening at all. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two, but his character was threatened by a cashier who offered him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who gets it. life returned despite attracting the wrong kind of man ... She had nothing special about it. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is very similar to "Cliffhanger": experienced guide, loses someone in a fall, minded awareness to help someone else, a lost treasure worth a lot of money and a gang of n'er-do-do-wells that exploit the guide. Except that Cliffhanger was a great vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit that Lithgow stole the program. <br /> <br /> Even unintentional comedy was bad. There were times when I was not sure if they were using a rubber-faced model as a substitute for Singer while trying in vain to assault the weather station (I did not mean to play a word game). Pressing her face against the doorpost and her clumsy manner generally did nothing to help her character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, such as seeing how the paint dries or how the grass grows. Or just close your eyes and examine the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
