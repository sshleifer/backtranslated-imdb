What I liked most about this movie was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who impressed me as one of the many beauties of Charles Boyer's classic "Algiers", in a leading role. She does well as Rita, an orphan who gets up to be a good crime boss. His rise to the top reminds me of the characters of Joan Crawford, for example. Mildred Pierce, who realizes her ambitions with fierce determination and willpower. If you are looking for a black film classic, you better look elsewhere. At several points, it is difficult to know where this story is going. The first time I had the impression that I was going to embrace Rita's plan of revenge against the father and the son was the one who tricked her into taking the rap of a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son. But the recovery time ended up being only a minor point, and a springboard to the second part of the film, somewhat confused, where Rita is increasingly involved in the corruption of the city. Anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second visit should clear up any haze. My copy is from a platinum box called "Mobster Movies". The quality of the image is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly omitting fragments of dialogues. There are eight movies in the $ 5.50 box, which makes each movie worth 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Bob, Rita's childhood friend. Alan Ladd does not have much time on screen. It is definitely the picture of Joan Woodbury.
