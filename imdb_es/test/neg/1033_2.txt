I love documentaries. The documentary by Andy Goldsworthy was great. I looked forward to this, but I was very disappointed. I knew Kahn and I was intrigued by the idea of ​​his solitary death in the men's room of Penn Station. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed. The only story here is of sadly deceived women who had sex with an ugly famous married man. In the absence of an explanation of the horrible behavior of this type, we endlessly receive footage of Kahn walking and painfully long, supposedly contemplative, shots of his soulless buildings. Actually, some of the buildings are interesting but the push of The movie asks us to think about the boy himself. The oversized soundtrack refers to an emotional pull that is totally absent from the film. The apparent gifts of Kahn do not justify his behavior or marty his lovers. This film seems to want to give Kahn the free pass of the great artist and so make the director and his mother are comprehensive figures, I do not buy it.
