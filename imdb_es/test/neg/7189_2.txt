The creators of this film must have sat down one day and said: "We are going to make fun of the Russians and, at the same time, show people how advanced we are (the Americans)." The film presents the Russians as an inferior people who can not understand the brilliant ideas presented by the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in other countries. However, this film goes very far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. It seemed to me like a propaganda movie made during the Cold War.
