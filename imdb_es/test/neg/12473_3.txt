At least for me. I've been following Mr. Almdovar's career since the beginning and I did not like this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was a disgrace, the kind of woman she portrays does not look so good, it makes the character incredible. Also, the singing scene was simply weird. I do not understand the point and lip timing was horrible. <br /> <br /> As Spanish, another thing that drove me crazy are the accents. Why do people who come from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and does not make sense. And the town? Are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", that they are not like that anymore. <br /> <br /> I expected more, but this time Mr. Almodovar did. I will not deliver, at least for me. I am not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job, I am saying that she does not belong to that place, she is not representing that character.
