I give it a three instead of the lowest number it deserves because of its history. A complete movie made by high school students! It shows, too, but that's part of the charm and appeal. Learn some of the things that George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Maybe because it's a group effort. <br /> <br /> A monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage - these children were far ahead of their time! - begins to devastate the city of Milpitas during a high school dance. The monster destroys at random, leaving garbage and smelly footprints. <br /> <br /> The film has local radio and television people, the mayor of Milpitas, the director of Samuel Ayer High School, and a lot of high school students and their parents, not to mention the daughter of the mayor like the ingénue. <br /> <br /> Mute? Yes! Funny? Yes! Large writing screen? Come on, they're high school students without training! Copy that comment for the performance, cinematography, direction, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is right next to San José in the heart of Silicon Valley; Maybe one of the graphic geniuses there will update the video in some way. Now there is a challenge.
