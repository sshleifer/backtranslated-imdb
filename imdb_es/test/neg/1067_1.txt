The time I lost watching this movie, I demand back! I felt bad afterwards, but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious, trying to make the audience feel bad for the people involved, but I do not care about anything. The characters are heartless and stupid. You do not get an explanation for some of the scenes and do not leave any thoughts after creating your own explanation. All the students in the film have problems, but since you do not feel for them, you do not believe in them. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop it. But I can not, then I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this.
