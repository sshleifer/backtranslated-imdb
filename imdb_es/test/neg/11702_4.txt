This is another film that I missed on Italian television when I was a child: notable for its quintet of aging stars, most of whom had never made a horror movie in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neal), is about the past crime of hidden men returning to persecute them. It takes the form of a ghostly ghost for the girl that everyone loved (Alice Krige) but from which they were forced to get rid of them after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated her egos. Fairbanks, who was responsible for the action, has two twin sons (Craig Wasson) and Krige also takes revenge on them. Soon, one of the last, the same Fairbanks, and even Douglas and Houseman, ended up dead. Therefore, the rest of Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the crime scene, where they also have to deal with a pair of sinister vagabonds that somehow fulfill Krige's orders. I really wanted to see these veterans in their last legs (Douglas died before the movie had premiered, but by then he had completed another role, although it turned out to be Astaire's own auspicious swan song), but the HISTORY OF GHOST also happened. Many changes in the mood, while maintaining a slow pace and emerge for a long time in the deal, are not a failed curiosity. Having sex dolls (including Wasson's frontal nudity!) And appalling makeup effects further muddied the waters and marred the old elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's cinematography (another long-standing notable).
