Snakes on a train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A Zombie curse is placed on a woman, which causes her to have live snakes inside her. Brujo, who is taking care of her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several confrontations on the train, Brujo's snake collection manages to separate from its owner and go hunting. While all this is happening, the normal and everyday passengers relax, what they do not know is that something deadly is directed towards them, and that they have not been eliminated. <br /> <br /> After seeing the wonderfully funny 'Snakes on a plane', I had to check this. I knew it was going to be a scam and that the movie would look cheap, but what I found was worse to watch. The whole curse plot was silly and should never have been included. The special effects are not terrible but they are not the best seen. I had no idea about the end. It was silly to see and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible, and it looked bad. They simply could not act to save their lives. If you want to laugh a lot, look at this, otherwise you should avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a train out of control, I repeat, we have a train out of control." - Driver (Stephen A.F. Day)
