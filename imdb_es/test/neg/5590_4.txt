STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest, for business commitments and accommodation in a luxury hotel. One night, they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and they invite her to return to their place, where they end up in a trio. Everything is fine, until David receives some negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed. But when some people involved in the deception are killed, things get complicated and they are forced to enter the sordid underground world of pornography and unconditional slavery to track down the woman who may have the key to everything. <br /> <br /> While the original movie was about the concept of snuff movies, this direct sequel to DVD addresses the healthier (!) theme of trios and sleazy sex. It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of emotion with a lot of T / A action going on. If this seems like your idea of ​​a good movie, you probably like it, but you'll probably be more at home in a pornography store than in a video store. <br /> <br /> This tries to copy the original. The dark and voyeuristic feeling of the film, but while it does a good job, it still can not stand the original one. It has an apathetic history, with an unreliable narrative flow. And compared to Cage, Schaech appears as endlessly wooden. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I suppose, and better than your average of these direct DVD sequels that seem to be coming to light. A lot these days, but really, have not we seen enough? **
