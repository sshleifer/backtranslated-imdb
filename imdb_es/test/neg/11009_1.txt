Let me first tell you that I REALLY really liked this movie. For the most part, the actors and actresses watched their parts, and they had a pretty good role in their roles, but the movie lacked a real plot. He seemed so wrapped up in looking "crazy" that no interesting story has shone. In addition, the work of the camera was often careless, I tried a camera work like snatch and it failed miserably. Most of the time, the shots that seemed right ended up being confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The nice, crazy guy who smells like a dog? Uhhhhhhh IN AGREEMENT. In general, a stinky fat 1/10. It's not worth your time.
