I remember seeing this on my local Blockbuster and I picked it up because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on a half-breed, half-leopard half-human creature that feeds on the people of Africa. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible! The actors are terrible! There is no script! Everything is improvised! Everything was filmed at night because they say it's the only time you see it. It is obvious the bull * bleep *! They film at night to make it scary. But, they could not scare me. After the first person was killed, I put this back in the case and took it to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm probably saying that I do not have the right to review a movie if I have not finished it. Well, this is one of the movies that did not deserve to be seen all the time. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
