I generally like the work of Sion Sono, but this movie was completely delayed. But, unfortunately, not delayed enough to make it entertaining. I sat with my mouth open, wondering when it would end. The plot only has a whisper of meaning. I think it was thought to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions, how could it not be? But humor, as it was, fell flat. It's not fun It's not scary. It is not bloody. I would say that maybe Sono was hired for this project, but it seems that he also wrote this boring garbage. I still have to fill a couple more lines, what else can you say? I guess I might end up saying: Better luck next time, Sono-san.
