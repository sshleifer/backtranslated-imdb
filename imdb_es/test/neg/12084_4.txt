Not well. Especially because you do not care what happens to all these people. Some comments: 1. I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their students, never teach them anything and look with fatigue and annoyance every time that student, which of course has been won in the space of 4 seconds, says something. 2. Well, then Rosina has a parent complex and, therefore, she is attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects of his father: if anything, Henry is much closer as a sensual and exalted person. 3. How can you believe that she would be more attracted to Tom Wilkinson than to Rhys Meyer? 4. Difficult to believe, if in fact she had been raised as a deeply religious child, it would be so careless to sleep with a Gentile after knowing him for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Some good things about the movie: At least she did not end up pregnant, without knowing who the father was ... All the description of life in the Jewish community in London is good.
