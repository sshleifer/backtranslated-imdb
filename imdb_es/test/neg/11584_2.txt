When the audience hear that two villains / popular characters will be fighting, they go to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy against Jason, in which two very popular terror icons try to kill each other. And, more like this, there's Godzilla vs. (Insert name here). But the generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the film is an image of the D list, but at least it comes up with a more convincing name, perhaps something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into seeing it. With a name like this, you know what you're getting into. <br /> <br /> A group of military men and women, including a sexy female scientist of 20 years or more, are left for dead by the army on an island inhabited by a giant Komodo dragon. While they can get to the island and the ship, they will be fine, but ... no ... there is a giant python that guards the ocean and moves away. Let's hope that all these guys can leave the island, and that Python and Komodo do not talk to each other in a kind of horrible special effects battle. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is bad on almost every road. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe the special effects are so corny, that the performance is amazing because nobody believes that these people are in danger with creatures that seem to have been made in a computer of the early 90's. , this movie is pretty funny. The creatures look so awkward, and the actors really do everything they do as if they were in danger. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this movie is a smoking stack of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not. This PG-13 rated movie actually shoots itself. Each time a curse arrives, a parrot noise beeps. Even words that can be said on the television network. How * squawks * are so low that they emit words, and nothing less than a parrot. Over time, these parrot noises came to me and I could not help but laugh at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, from the silly start to the final ridicule of the Night of the Living Dead style, but also something funny. As a horror movie, it fails miserably, like an action movie, it fails a little less, but it's still pretty bad, and like comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * from ****. 95 minutes PG-13 for some violence and Squawked out cursing.
