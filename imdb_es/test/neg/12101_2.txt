What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was. <br /> <br /> Emilio Est√©vez was completely wasted and almost not used everywhere. Jon Lovitz was very funny but meaningless. Harry Dean Stanton, why bother? And it was just me or Kari Wuhrer can hardly act in this case. <br /> <br /> The story was quite non-existent and really disconnected. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that occurred. Like the "uncles" of surfing who renounce their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about you NEVER saw them surf once? The configuration of some scenes took too long and did not give us enough benefits to make us care. Nothing in this "movie" felt really true or genuine. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is that some (very few) scenes from the stage were filmed very well and some scenes were slightly interesting. Do not see this when there are so many better meaningless movies out there.
