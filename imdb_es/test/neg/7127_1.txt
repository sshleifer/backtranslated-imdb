This movie was absolutely gut. Possible that it is in fact a contamination. The subtle tense atmosphere of the new original version is nowhere to be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but it is still the best performance in this film, and her death is the best of it, although she deserved a better death. It is the sign of very bad writing and direction. I guess he made this movie to end his connection with her as his trash. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. Not tense. It's not fun. It does not make any sense at all. And as stated earlier, Sarah Michelle Gellar offers the only reasonable performance of the entire cast.
