It was funny because everything was so unrealistic, I mean, come on, as if a pop star just showed up at a public school and fell in love with the girl who is obsessed with him. Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone, except the protagonist, was completely horrendous in acting. The dialogue was corny, the premise was stupid and the camera work was poorly done. I felt like I was watching a badly made home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I have wasted almost 2 hours of my life that I will never go back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, except that I prefer to hit myself in the face several times, than see this movie again.
