Some people thought that this was funny because they loved the political problems discussed in this article. However, I am so tired of the state of the bipartisan system in our country that I can not stand the propaganda of both sides. I was expecting a horror show, but they gave me "cute" zombies and partisan bullfighting. I see my horror movies to scare me. This did not even try to be scary. Also, this does not have the wit of Romero in his political / cultural satire intertwined in his films ... this was a blatant story, without imagination, which was difficult to assimilate (for the wrong reasons). On the positive side, if you hate Bush ... you'll love this (I do not agree with hatred or Bush with this statement)
