It begins with a couple of disgusting sexual comedy jokes, but soon reveals its true colors: it wants to be a clone of the "Desire of Death". I say "I want" because the script becomes more and more ridiculous the minute it ends up looking like an absurd parody of "Desire of Death"! From a love scene in a room inexplicably full of candles, to "heroes" who disguise themselves as commanders and wave their machine guns because they do not want to attract attention (!), Even the bad guys who drive through the city in a black van long after If it has been recognized as your vehicle, this movie has too many ridiculous points to fit into a list. The other big problem is that you can not distinguish most of the characters; Of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree are and even James Van Patten, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes, and I would not know the difference.
