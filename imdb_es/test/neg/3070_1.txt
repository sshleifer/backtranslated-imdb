Any movie must have an idea; Simple or more complex, you need one ... The problem with Frigate, ... is once again, that when you decide to make a movie, you are so eager to do "whatever" that you forget this main detail, and as a result that the characters do anything without justification, behave without justified reasons ... they are simple puppets that go throughout the film with the taste of the wind. It is boring and sad to see them appear and disappear like the cards that are discarded in a game. Frigate always seems to have talent in advertising, it's a job of her own ... and that leads you to see what she did ... but in the end there's always a big disappointment. It is not enough to have a movie full of "the stars of the pink magazine of Portugal" ... especially when half of them can not act ... they just pretend to be funny. Here my only positive point is for the actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few who are not stars: he makes an effort to establish some credibility, and in a film so disorganized without any direction (of any kind) I give him the credit for trying hard But this movie is worth seeing as a manual of "how not to make a movie" ... and if the previous work of Frigate is bad ... this is a "masterpiece" to achieve the title of AWFUL. In a nutshell, .. Just take a look! It will do you good ... and if you do home movies with your family, ... and you always feel bad about your work ... so spend 30 minutes on this professional job called "professional" ... home-made Things they will look like Powerful Hollywood Flicks compared to Sorte Nula.
