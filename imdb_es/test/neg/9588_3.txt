This film tries to skewer the time of studies in Hollywood and the moral of the fifties. Guy Stone is thought to be of the Rock Hudson type, but both the script and the actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a version of George Hamilton with a baritone voice, which is an unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble appreciating this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then shoots the handsome young men and women who share his bed every few hours. <br /> <br /> Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's celibate lesbian manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director does not really know what to do with it. The flaw is in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers for it. <br /> <br /> Carrie Preston's Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors." As it is written, Sally de Preston is good at laughing, but little else. The newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He can not act, and seems to have been chosen for his sexy body and good looks. <br /> <br /> Like many recent films, "Straight-Jacket" is a "drama", a comedy film that shifts haphazardly to A Drama about two-thirds of the way through the movie. And, as in almost all dramas, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. The excessive use of the musical soundtrack also creates a number of tracks that distract. <br /> <br /> The film really did not satirize anything about the 1950s. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain," which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound, as well as the mentality of Study on formula films, "Straight-Jacket" fails to represent Hollywood in the 1950s at all. The dialogue, sets and behavior of the key characters are not described in stead of Hollywood stereotypes of the 1950s. The same can be said of the spread of general customs, social trends and fashions of the decade 1950 as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with the satire of the 1950s in "Little Shop of Horrors." There is no comparison; "Little Shop" hits the nail in the head, while "Straight-Jacket" does not even know there's a nail. <br /> <br /> The motivations, too, seem random. Rick Foster is supposed to be a principled liberal, however, drops almost immediately by a materialistic idiot like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy's status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, it comes into conflict for reasons that are not entirely clear. And although Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this point of the plot simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick appears as a gay man of the 1990s, not a gay author of the 1950s. In fact, modern morality infuses this film, which should not, if it were really a satirical look at Hollywood homophobia in the decade from 1950. <br /> <br /> The holes of the plot in this ragtag movie also abound. Saul repeatedly says he's going to give Freddie Stevens to the feds, but he never does, allowing Freddie to take Guy out. Jerry and Saul's plan for "in" Guy never makes any sense, nor does Sally's sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy has admitted that he is homosexual, apparently it does not matter and ends up being a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​manages to save this movie. Michael Pinkey's cinematography is pedestrian. Sometimes, the movie almost looks like a filmed work instead of a motion picture (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is restricted to medium shots, and the movie has an incredibly static. The Chris Conlee edition does not help the film either. The long scenes that would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or changes in the point of view remain uncut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film relies heavily on the CGI effects of Guy's house, created by visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and clumsy, and is remarkably amateur. <br /> <br /> My general impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy, the plot confusing, the characterizations totally inconsistent and far from the brand, non-existent satire, performances abroad and outside the brand , and the comic goes off. It's almost an amateur movie. It's as if someone took a production from high school and threw him $ 10 million.
