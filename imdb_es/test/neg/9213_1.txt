Why I did not like the movie, apart from the ugliness of the actors themselves, is that someone really can believe in that shit. <br /> <br /> First, the second coming of Christ will be at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ comes the day of judgment, he will not come as he did before, in human form. He will come in His full glory as God and we will be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will do it! Secondly, I have seen the eternal gay pride illustrated in this film with the indisputable "I read the Bible last night and it is not written anywhere". Well, it is. Moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who make love to each other as if the man and woman were killed, because they will never inherit the kingdom of God because they are disgusting ! If we really were for us to follow the Bible word for word, now there would be executions, right? But I think misinforming people does more harm than this would do ... That's what the Old Testament says. <br /> <br /> There are many lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are the Son of God, but to make a movie after it really makes you think how many idiots can make a movie.
