I could not stand the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to shut up. He had a strange way of speaking and the sentences he was given to read did not make it better. She had no idea why the men of the city were so taken with her to cause all these problems, except that in a town populated by men, she seemed to be the only woman over ten and less than sixty years old. Even after a terrible tragedy, his voice lacked human emotion, he seemed unable to grasp the events of his life. She gave her lines with the same emotion if she said "I love you", "I hate you", "the bank is executing a mortgage", "my dress is on fire". Was it really filmed in Ireland? The sun burned throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. I lived in Ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. Almost everything was still harvested. If farmers in Ireland could only harvest for long dry stretches, then the country would have died of hunger hundreds of years ago. It seems like there is not much money to make the movie. The black and white flashbacks looked as if they had been filmed with the security cameras that one can get at Sam's Club.
