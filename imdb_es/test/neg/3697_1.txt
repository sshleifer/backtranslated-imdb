I saw this movie because it had a giant person and it was labeled as a monster movie. I do not understand why it's called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I expected a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movie had relationship problems and people thought a woman was crazy because she saw a spaceship crashing with a giant inside for an inexplicable reason. The action began a few minutes towards the end. Since the woman was murdered, is not that murder? Could not they have done something other than murder her? If you see this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie, do not see it. It is not a monster movie. It's a drama.
