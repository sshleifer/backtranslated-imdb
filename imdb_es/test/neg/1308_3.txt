Normally I do not write reviews, but for this movie I had to do it. I am surprised that the acting talent in this movement is wasted ... the script was frightening ... the horrible edition ... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to whom and what the hell they are doing. The second half of the film slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. The only salvation is the nice, but still limited CGI, and the location is London. I gave it 3 stars for that, and the fact that the actors still tried to do a good job with the nonsense that was given to them. If you feel like losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn entertainment, this is the movie for you. But I would recommend doing something else with your time, like watching the actual archive file online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
