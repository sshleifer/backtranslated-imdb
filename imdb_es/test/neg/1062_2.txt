It's as if the Stagnant Masquerade Man of the Ghostbusters had reincarnated in the body of Rutger Hauer and was taking revenge on the pregnant wife of a rival! If you see an obese Hauer chasing a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the tingling sensation in that contest) it seems fine, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is the look of an Iraqi prisoner of war after six years in prison, then hungry people around the world should be in line with a prison in Baghdad. In general, "Tactical Assault" qualifies 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is excellent. Mitchell burns the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane burns on its own (by an enemy missile), with which the film loses the little enthusiasm it had to start.
