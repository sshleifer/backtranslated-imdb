For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to see the movie. I had also made the mistake of seeing 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before watching Showtime and for some strange reason I thought Eddie Murphy was still fun. Well, it is not. In fact, it almost seems that he has been castrated. While watching this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided that this was a script good enough to lend his name too. There is no chemistry between him and Murphy at all. A horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is supposed to be good can not be worse than this. Not long after I sat down on the unfortunate Showtime, I saw National Security starring Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts but it was not so good. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if you are a fan of Deniro, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE!
