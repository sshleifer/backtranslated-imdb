The best part of this movie is the first, located in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the beginning of the film is deliciously surprising. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese insists uselessly in situations and stereotyped characters, trying to fuse neorealist suggestions and video-music techniques, Fellin surrealist memories and a very annoying and completely off topic soundtrack, guiding everything towards an ending that gives you the feeling of an exaggerated long The story cuts abruptly short. Frankly, this is a truly overvalued movie and Crialese is a true overrated director.
