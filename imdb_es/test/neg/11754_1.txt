No matter what other people have said, you can not revise this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on its own, it would be a 2-3 out of 5 movie, but it is a new version of a 4-5 movie. and therefore has standards to meet and we need to see if it met those standards. If the film was a new version or, as in Planet of the Apes, a new image of the original, you could see the movie by itself, only referring to the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model of the 'Mona Lisa', put it in another way and painted it, I could only compare the framing, the concept, etc., with the original, but if someone repainted it in the position of the original, I would have to compare it completely. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie not only stops being as good as the original that fails spectacularly, whether we like it or not the original was one of the best films in history. In fact, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock, but it ended up degrading him and his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The degrading aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It has nothing to do with whether they acted better or not, is that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was quite innocent, Norman did not really understand sex, had almost no contact with the outside world and when he meets the beautiful Marion and observe how she changes, you feel that part of her does it out of fascination, since she does not really understand sex and its attraction for her, this makes Norman nice and almost antihero, you are on her side because she does not do it at all. He understands the world and is constantly fighting with himself and with his 'Mother'. In the new version that all the dynamics are gone, I must admit that Janet Leigh is not my type, but she is very attractive and you can see that Anne Heche is really unattractive, so Norman considers that "she" Marion is attractive if you add that. Norman de Vince Vaughn masturbating while looking at her and you get a Norman who is just waiting for the opportunity to masturbate with any naked woman no matter how she looks, for whom you do not feel sympathy, further destroy the innocent nature of Norman. Putting the porn magazines in your room. Destroy a character that we like and what we feel sorry for, it's like doing 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character as a pimp, totally degrading. <br /> <br /> The only other character that I had problems with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's co-worker. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says that the line "must have noticed my wedding ring" provokes a laugh response since it is joking, when Rita says it, it seems plausible, since there really is no other reason why The man would flirt with Anne Heche on her. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am very impartial, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite movie of all time, if the film had been a reworking, with an Angle, then I could have turned these characters into their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> He hooked the famous fact that the film would be too bloody in color and made it in black and white to diminish it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in its own way and gave it a beauty that could never be captured in color, and it is a sad statement about how movies are desensitizing the public that people have said what the scene was like. The shower. More terrifying in color. (nb before people think "can not spell", remember I'm from England and spell it in color) <br /> <br /> A remake should be just that, once again, this is a fake, a full copy. and a very bad one in that. I could continue comparing, but it does not make sense, almost everything is superior to the original. The only thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called it 'The Stiff' behind his back) and Mortensen offers a more credible performance, although less pleasant. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who hold the originals. <br /> <br /> In general, a film that should be labeled as "Shameful expensive experiment failed". Just see if it is compared to the original or if the original is unknown to you. But see the original image too 'The movie would have a 3 out of 5 if it was original or a review, but since it's 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
