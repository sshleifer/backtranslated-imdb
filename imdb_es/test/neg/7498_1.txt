Hello everyone: it's worth it, I'm in a PhD program on Indonesian politics and I came back this semester after a year of field work, mostly in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of movies in general, so I went out as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This I saw in the theater, since it opened while I was there and, fortunately, closed soon after. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this movie? The spouses and spoiled daughters of the Indonesian super elite whose antics are parodied in a weak and ineffective way? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford a single dish, much less a full meal, in the movie's central restaurant? Or Indonesian gay men, whose dilemma in society dominated by the country's Muslims is reduced to absurdly simplistic preaching and how to respect oneself. <br /> <br /> If all this were not bad enough, the soundtrack was recorded or mixed with such ineptitude that even the native-speaking Indonesians could not hear many of the lines. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you're looking for a cutting-edge gay themed film from a region of the world that seems the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westler" of the early 80's, or "My Beautiful Laundrette", of the same period, have a much greater success in the treatment of homophobia, and they do it without showing incessant and neat scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can not educate all of their children or keep them healthy.
