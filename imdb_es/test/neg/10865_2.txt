Well, then writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to produce his own movie and fill the cast of flashy names. Good for him! Now, what he really needs is inspiration and talent to devise a truly worthwhile scenario instead of the overly pretentious and ambiguous shit he wrote here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It is an effort for fanatics of the fans of the 60s and the recently renewed Grindhouse film formula in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop fails shamefully in his configuration and there are many obvious reasons for this. Do not you have a story to tell? Or at least not very interesting? but it tries seriously to conceal this by means of numerous redundant turns of the plot, lots of free and unfriendly right-handers for women, too long and pious dialogues that aspire to be great and enormous amounts of senseless violence. The plot seems complex but in reality it can be summarized in a sentence. The old vendetta between two bands of rival motorcyclists burst again with the arrival of a new member; a child who may or may not be the lost son of a double crossing wench who was executed in 1976. That's it, really! Everything else, going from betraying gang members to recruiting former timer members to playing with their nympho girl informant, is a completely useless and confusing stuffing material. Another major problem in "Hell Ride" is the tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego of Larry Bishop. He definitely should not have rewarded himself with the role of a tough and relentless gang leader, since he only presents himself as incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other stars and more experienced in the movie. Granted, Bishop starred in a couple of real motorcyclist exploitation films from the 60s (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but that was a long time ago and, honestly, he's not as good as an actor. Maybe it was simply Bishop's lifelong dream to play a character who always outdid his enemies and for which every hot babe craves sexually, and simply wrote a complete script about it. Veterans in the cast, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, do not bother to leave a plausible impression and I can not say I blame them. All this production is scanty and pathetic and I can not recommend it to anyone, regardless of how many beautiful girls parade with their naked breasts and their bare ends.
