But even the cartoons need a plausible plot. I suppose that in 1934 a part of that audience a long time ago would enjoy this lukewarm farce. It does not age well. It gives Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts, expert and experienced support players, an opportunity for the lead roles. Pendelton, who appears in a prominent place in the series Thin Man, does everything possible, but is surpassed by the ingenious plot. Against the backdrop of being a play with gang members, it is not exactly an original material. The salvation of the film is the always excellent Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But do not waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would encourage anyone who sees him in his effort at Holiday, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same time of 1936, but much better script and history. Better gags and it goes without saying that the power of the stars also.
