I was sitting at home and turning channels when I came across what potentially sounded like an interesting movie. I like Destruction type movies and I decided to watch them. I do not know why, but I ended up watching it for 2 hours. We've seen this kind of movie, I do not know how many times. <br /> <br /> In 1998 - 2000 there were a dozen films that dealt with some kind of global destruction. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact, which was more credible than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) Cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) There is no background information or explanation about weather patterns. If you are going to make a film about the climate, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) Why do only 2 or 3 people realize that the storm is converging in Chicago ... are there no more experts in the field? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I do not really care about anyone, except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no development of the character. 5) No subject that evokes thoughts and an incorrect subject. And this is only the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion will show us some scenes of destruction and a search and rescue operation, as has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie, I can only imagine what we're going to expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will continue ... what an original
