.... Then why on Earth would you see 'Sexual Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Las Vegas I have seen them live and I have enjoyed them very much. I think it is a smart and unique intellectual comic that manages to retain extreme obesity. Crook, I only know the best comedy of the last 10 years along with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. As Gareth was simply funny, and I was interested in how to turn another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So the boyfriend and I went to the multiplex last night and the movie was very funny, just because the dialogue and the mediocre, mindless jokes that Ferris and Dave had made were delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm for the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (they have done it better in fact) and I even think that Vegas would be a straight and decent actor. The trite scenes in which he says he misses his wife were about to touch them, although the ** SPOILER ** added in the scene at the end where his wife returned him had to stretch out, it just was not believable. And throughout the movie, Vegas only seems to miss his wife 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The movie became grotesquely unfunny and, quite simply, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. No, I add, when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's free explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why it was not even a little funny, and it made me feel a little bad. Also totally unnecessary was the inclusion of Jeremy's character picking up his nose, before showing a close-up of the bogey on his finger. Just the fact that he had slipped would have made him smile, he was a pathetic character and he would only have made him look as low as possible, but it was not necessary to show the mucus up close and he had rank. <br /> <br /> One of the scenes that I considered hilarious in relation to sex was Vegas in the trio. Your boring conversation with the second guy has just highlighted the fact that the trios do not always have an infinite ecstasy. It's not that I know it ... <br /> <br /> That's all I can really say. I'll finish with this, and this is actually my main criticism of the movie. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. It's not a 'Trainspotting' which is for sure ... it's not even a 'Love Actually' (you'd have to have a heart of stone to not throw up that), and 3 million pounds could really have been put on a better project . 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a little-known and wonderful British comedy, and it was made for less than 3 million. I just hope that the BFC learns of 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and that it is not so free in the future. Although the terrible critics that this film is receiving are only improving the box office collections. :-)
