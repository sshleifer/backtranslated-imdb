If you have not seen "War at home," let me tell you what you've been missing. It is a program about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only have been nervous and funny in the 60s. Where America has grown in its acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc., this show seems to discuss that progress. It is a step back in the evolution of the United States. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the jokes of the program is that the WHITE daughter is dating a BLACK child from school. This is obviously fun, since you can not see that kind of relationship in any mall in the United States. I have lived in both small cities and large cities, so do not give me some kind of red state excuse, blue state. Not only is this the joke, but the father, who is allegedly not racist, finds him disturbing and asks his daughter to break up with her boyfriend repeatedly, which is against him: "It may sound like a racist, but it is a silly character. " <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, a second joke is that one of the children, and soon to be sub-sexual, is ambiguous in their sexual orientation. The audience learns again and again that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, fearing that his son will hit him, since all homosexual men are nymphomaniac wild men, who can ' t control his will The father always comes to the acceptance of his son, once per program, but usually avoids it in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way that this program can be cured in my eyes is if the exposure continues to these "unnatural events in life", opens a little the eyes of the father, but that may be too much to ask, And also, with jokes like these, I'm sure we'll have hilarity in the next episodes like: Episode 13, "The father votes against the women voters," and episode 14, "My Muslim neighbor is a terrorist." <br /> <br /> Please, leave this program, FOX. We are living in a different world than your executives grew up.
