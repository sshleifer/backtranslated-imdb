Dresden had high expectations due to its spectacular theme and its high budget. I really wanted to do it and I really wanted it to be good ... but it is not. The only good thing is the special effects that are very well made, but, as in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> Wrongly written, the script tries to comply with gender rules. with standard elements of suspense / love story, but there is no depth or originality at all. It is well below average. The following: it is also misdirected. It has an uninteresting TV direction style, with many close ups and great action action thanks to a quick edit where, in reality, there is no action or suspense. The actors are not bad, but there is no action that is moving in any way. <br /> <br /> I do not know ... they are obviously trying to make a typical television movie and not a film for the cinema. , where it is always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why do they try to meet the typical commercial rules of Hollywood? It really feels like the scriptwriter did a weekend class with some American writing guru and then delivered this mess. Is not there a producer responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy / visual style or simply in these magical cinematic moments that make some television movies excellent? Do you think a television audience is stupid and does not need to get a high-quality cinematic experience? The Downfall was a very good example for a good television movie, but there was probably an executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this, rent "downfall" instead ...
