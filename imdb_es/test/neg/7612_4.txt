I found this film extremely disturbing. Treadwell is delirious and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from mental illness. The video that is shown is him and not an actor, but still shows a behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show real images of a suicide? Let's not pice the words. The film shows images of the behavior that led directly to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think that Treadwell is a kind of hero, think again. The images he recorded are about him and not about the bears and foxes he said he was helping. He did not conduct meaningful research on his habits or numbers and did nothing to really protect them. All he did was run through the woods and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. The reality is that by helping to desensitize animals to humans, he exposed them to great risk. His indulgent behavior did not cause his own death, but also the death of his partner Amy, in addition to exposing his beloved bears and foxes to further damage. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about the actions of Werner Herzog to compile this film as he did. <br /> <br /> A friend and I have had a long discussion about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that severely disturbed people make interesting themes and cites the movie Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We did not see the real Madga Goebells put cyanide capsules in their own children's mouths. <br /> <br /> There was something about the use of real images in Grizzly Man that reminded me of the horrible tragedy of the football stadium where people were crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, chose to continue recording the horror. <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's images are more about Treadwell. But Herzog has done the same. His own personality and opinions are conveyed in this documentary, which is supposedly about another person. Scenes like the one that listens to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We did not need Herzog to shed a tear with one of Treadwell's ex-girlfriends. It was not added to the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie showed us that Treadwell was very self-indulgent, but he also showed us that Herzog is too.
