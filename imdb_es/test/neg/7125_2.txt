I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them, and I see them every few months. I lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can get a good scare about the quality of Japanese cinema. I think Takashi Shimizu created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four installments. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat excited about the opening of The Grudge 2 in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before seeing the four originals. The grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween scare from the American Grudge of 2004. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 started badly, and it got out of there. I kept waiting for it to improve, for it to make sense, to show Shimizu's talent, none of this happened. What's great about Shimizu Ju-on's work is the story. It is true that it is generally said in a disconnected style that you should think about connecting its components, but it is still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of free deaths of characters that you never had time to start worrying about. <br /> <br /> The edition was atrocious. Offline (as in Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the sequence of the scene was exhausting. I kept thinking, "This is so stupid" and "No, he did not really sell that much, right?" I wanted to leave the theater, run home and see the original work, just to make sure that Shimizu has not always made this gut silly, generic, boring, meaningless, united. /> <br /> If you really have your heart set on seeing this movie, I suggest you wait for 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people who were in the theater with me left in about 45 minutes. I debated about doing that myself. Going home and cleaning the house really sounded like a better way to spend my time at that time. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised at how bad this movie was. Pray that Sam Raimi will not spend more money to make The Grudge 3. It's just not worth it anymore. Sigh.
