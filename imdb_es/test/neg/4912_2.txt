Emraan Hashmi post MURDER did some good roles in Bhatt's films, but another director only made use of his kisses and his naughty image <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and came after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was already fed up with him and those roles. <br /> <br /> At first, the movie has a good twist. It felt like an Abbas Mustan movie, but then it becomes a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climax. <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible movie Music saves grace The camera work is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi simply repeats his act from his previous films and has 2 expressions in all Dino looks rigid, speaks as if he is practicing Hindi and does well in some scenes that Udita has no expression and irritates
