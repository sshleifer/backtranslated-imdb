A modern scary movie? Yes, it's ... <br /> <br /> The hippies, the pacifists and the ecologists got together to give us a scary movie. I did not recognize it when I saw it only 2 years ago that it was a scary movie, but that's it. Exactly what it is ... <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this movie and the films the Nazis made about us in WW2 and the same movies we did about them ... this is pure propaganda and just talk about them ... that they believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracies, false moon conspiracies, oil spikes and greater environmentalism. What I can say is that this movie clicks the buttons, makes you ask questions and, ultimately Instance, just forget it ... If your scars enter your houses, close the doors and supply for the nuclear winter that we all know will come when Bush provokes the Chinese in a nuclear war.
