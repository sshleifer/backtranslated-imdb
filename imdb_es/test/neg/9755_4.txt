Step Up is a fair dance film about some children who get their great performance opportunity. The movie is average in every way with little more for the viewer. An athlete struggles against external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teacher who sees something special. The performance was good, but the dialogue and the direction had little to add to overcome a predictable story. However, you still feel pretty good with the outcome of the movie. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B + movie with moderate continuity errors and dialog setbacks. The stage was good and the characters stayed true to life. It's worth seeing if you like that kind of movie.
