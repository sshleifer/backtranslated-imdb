Let me clarify this ... "The Church" has a mechanism of "blocking" security to prevent the spirits from leaving, but is the final solution to take it to the ground? LOFL! Maybe I'm missing the plot. Maybe this guy is from Ed Wood's film school or something. This movie is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. All that segment of Rosemary's Baby-esq was hilarity. I can go to my Halloween costume shop on the corner and get a better drag than that. The whole movie needs to be remade. Correctly. There were so many things that were minimized ... so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and go through the roof. I'm not sure if the flaw is in the writing or editing, but what I saw should not have such a high rating.
