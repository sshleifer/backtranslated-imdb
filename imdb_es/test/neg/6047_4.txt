In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) come to an old building to disconnect power. They accidentally activate a portal and reach another dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a Spider Queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets with survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse), and finds the inventor of the portal, Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They come together, trying to rebuild a portal to bring them back home. "Webs" is an observable plagiarism of "Sliders", only worse. Most dialogues seem to be written by a person who has not finished primary school, so they are imbeciles. Also, the story is illogical and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist who tries to start up his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is very funny. The face of Richard Grieco looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is horrible. If the viewer turns off his brain, he or she may like this forgettable television movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Na Teia do Terror" ("On the web of horror")
