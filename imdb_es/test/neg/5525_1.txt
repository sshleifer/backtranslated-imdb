This is so poor that you can see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a crew of a hoary spaceship that is in a Russian ship, apparently abandoned, Russian. <br /> <br /> In the vastness of empty space, the two boats accidentally collide (!) - and the 'Alien'-esque amusement occurs when a cyborg from the Russian ship threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The interiors of the spaceships are clearly a doll factory (metal corridors, boilers). , pipelines). In this totally unconvincing environment, 'Kody', 'Serpent' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, snarl, run and continuously and repeatedly fire their shotguns without firing them. <br /> <br /> Continuity errors are what define this film, and they are incredible: <br /> <br /> Things appear and disappear. Shotguns are tormented. A cigar becomes longer when smoked. Shotguns are tormented again, just to be sure. The content of a bottle increases when drunk. <br /> <br /> The film progresses through the usual clich√©s through intense ham performance, poxy camera work and Ed Wood's quality accessories to a climax.
