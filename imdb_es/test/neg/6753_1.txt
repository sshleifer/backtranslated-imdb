This called movie is horrible! The actors can not act. There is no plot. I think they need to start from scratch and shoot again. I hope you can correct the defects of acting in this movie. I'd like to see the trailer after it's shot again. Maybe there is hope for it. I'm not willing to hurt feelings, but I think high school kids can do a better job. The costumes could have been much better. I'm sorry, but this just did not do it for me. Normally I enjoy the trailers of this site but ... I do not find it entertaining. I hope you take the criticism well because I think you will get a lot more from the others regarding this movie.
