The great Yul Brynner, who won an 'Oscar', and who has starred in blockbusters such as 'The Ten Commandments' among many others, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot films like this one, 'Sartana', and others. Regretable, by the way. One should have pity to see him do his best to make this idiot thing stand up. Gone are the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, in 'The Magnificent Seven', and walked under the famous soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein. It's hard to make a living being an actor, sometimes.
