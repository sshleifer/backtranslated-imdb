1ยบ seen 10/29/2006 - 4 of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): entertaining story of a group of five children who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in World War I how England entered the war. They are told not to go to the greenhouse in the uncle's mansion, which, of course, they do over and over again, and they discover a sand fairy who daily wishes that it only lasts until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" mentioned in the title, created by the Jim Henson group and expressed by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that your wishes usually cause other problems that you are supposed to learn from. This part of the film is not done very well because it is obvious that the children, mainly the character of Freddie Highmore, do not learn from them, but continue to resort to "that" to solve their next big problem. "IT" is not as much fun as it could have been with comedian Eddie Izzard who did not really have many opportunities to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted like the eccentric guy, although he is the best character. The children are fine in terms of their acting skills, but the story would probably have been much better to enter the realm of fantasy, but they also had a human story to tell, which probably caused confusion with the filmmakers. So, overall, this was a good movie, but it could have been much better.
