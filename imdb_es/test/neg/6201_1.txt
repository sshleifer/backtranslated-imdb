I did not know what to expect when I started watching this movie, in the end I was pulling my hair out. This was one of the most pathetic movies of this year ... in fact, in the last ten years. David Dhawan should give up his career as a director. I still have to find an original script in which David Dhawan has worked. This was a complete and little steal of Hitch. I have nothing against the remakes as such, but this is so bad that it makes you even hate the original (which was pretty decent). I do not understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere, that this was supposed to be Govinda's return vehicle. If that is true, then only God can save his career. Salman just exaggerated to the hilt. Govinda, who I think is an actor of very high caliber, was completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do other than wear designer clothes and smile for no reason or rhyme. Please stay away from this one!
