The original Hitchcock classic benefited greatly not only from the performance, but also from the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of innocence: a kind of young adolescent idol. He was not an actor who had represented the bad guys before this; nor was it physically fit for the role that the public could have imagined a psychopath, especially in the 50s when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in the cinema. What exactly is the reason why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a piece of the true Hitchcockian genius? The hearings were taken by surprise to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> That's why this new version does not work, even a bit, despite trying to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone who would never be considered a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable as such. He lacks the fragile aspect of Perkins and his acting skills are also clearly inferior, at least in this role (honestly, has there ever been an actor who can convey nervousness as genuinely as Anthony Perkins?). Although, to begin with, it was a useless repetition, the bad protagonism of the most important character in history stinks this movie completely. <br /> <br /> As a side note, I think that Hollywood's propensity to renew great movies. because "young people" refuse to see everything that is not filmed in color, not only does it stink of corporate greed, but it is exceptionally disrespectful of the original work. As for the viewers who can not see in black and white, it is their loss. Hopefully, they will mature in the future and will no longer need bright colors to maintain their attention. When they do, they will discover that black and white sometimes works much better. With the background muted, history and performances are much more frontal and central. And in many cases, the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography can not be obtained in color.
