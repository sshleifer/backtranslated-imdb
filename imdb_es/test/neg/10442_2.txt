Now, of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the film was good, but the factor of the emotion of a species plummeted afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. has an excellent role as a son looking for the shark that killed his father. A megald√≥n is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous too. The sight of the shark was really scary at some angles, but the effects were blurry, and the scenes were a bit weak in some places. With the mini-sub weapons there, that would get a whole school of sharks out there. It was great that the son would exact revenge on that monstrosity, although in fact it would also cost him his life. As they say that revenge has its price, but was it worth it? That response could go on and on, and this movie was a big disappointment. The beginning was good, and in the end, it was like the Titanic. 1 OF 5 STARS!
