Mario Racocevic, from Europe, is the only user who has published a comment so far and covers the main points of the film. However, another film difficult to buy in the United Kingdom. I had to check the "Midnight Video" that has a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought by mail this and a similar title for only SKR30, a title. <br /> <br /> This movie is classified under many "aliases" depending on when and where it is marketed. previously bought "The Bloodsucker leads the Dance" (which you'll find if you look in Imdb under "people" and type "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the Count on his private island in this last film received a copy of his words from Italian to English by an actor with a voice that sounds unmistakably sad and quite tired. I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute murdered in the film about the subject. My choice, of course, was to see another exit by the elvisa Krista Nell. <br /> <br /> There are quite a few sub-plot subplots in the film that involve blackmail / extortion, sordid affairs with the mothers of girlfriends, a bicycle chase that results in a gang hit, a gangrape by a Friends of the motorcycle "client", bad quality photos, transvestites of transvestites, etc. that give a flavor to this film summarized in one word - SLEAZE, (but artistic sordidness). The aforementioned collaborator liked this movie, but the low rating suggests that other Imdb fans do not explain their "why and why". Personally, I thought that there were too many secondary arguments and that they had not been included in the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters with the central plot and the development of their characters on the screen. Also a professional movie. the editor was very necessary since some of the scenes seemed to last too long, having said what they wanted, so that the film seemed to crawl in some places; eg the scene of the transvestite dancing. Krista Nell appears in a fruity scene with a client, but this is also just a vignette and I was left wanting more of her, the director and the script. <br /> <br /> I love the political imprecision shown in the oldest films (this is 30 years since its inception), for example Smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other. I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such.
