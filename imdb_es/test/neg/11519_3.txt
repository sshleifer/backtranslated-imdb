Being one of the founding fathers of the monkey movie club in my region (this also includes monkeys / chimpanzees and orangutans). I'm reviewing this movie from the point of view of a monkey movie. After all, it's a summer of monkeys, more than 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, pranks, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. In short, the poor child needs money for the things he wants. Fortunately, there are some monkeys (chimpanzees) that have a reward for their head that will make the blood of Boba Fett or Dog (Duane Chapman) flow. As the child tries to catch the monkeys, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the weirdo, flirts with a girl who is twice as old, and learns that the best way to deal with the bullies is that Someone point them with a shotgun. br /> <br /> There is the problem. So much emphasis is placed on the child that chimps simply do not get the screen time they deserve. Chimpanzees are not as talented as the chimpanzees who play Jack from the M_P trilogy or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So do not watch this movie hoping to find the next big thing in the genre Chimp. The chimpanzees hit some sweet twists, which is what the film needed most. There is an epic scene of chimpanzees bursting into the house of poor families and destroying all the things they worked so hard for. Serious enthusiasts of the monkeys movie will want to rent the movie just for this scene. <br /> <br /> So to close this movie is not for the serious enthusiasts of the monkeys movie. I would not recommend this film to families, as it encourages the rebellion of children against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for adults who love hardcore monkeys and well-supervised children.
