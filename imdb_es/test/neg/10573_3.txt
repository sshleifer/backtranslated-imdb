I thought this would be fun. I do. I do not know what happened But I think a lot of the problem falls with the casting. I do not know who this child is, he could be a good person, but he was not right for this movie. And the supporting cast was great, which only makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander, but then Keith David starts talking, or Leslie Nielsen or Marion Ross, and it's like someone lights a light and suddenly you can pay attention. again and you think it might not be so bad. But when they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is abundant, so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this. I mean I had a couple of funny snippets, since I remember laughing a couple of times, but at this moment I do not remember why and it was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> I'm really giving it a "take it" or "leave it" rating, but I think most people should leave it.
