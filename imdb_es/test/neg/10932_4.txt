The material is poor ... the script is terrible ... the performance is mediocre at best and the music conveys what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head. <br /> <br /> Give this a miss ... even Yancy Butlers is not hot enough even in the semi-nude scenes to save this gut. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the delirious people of Yancy Butler ..... given what I have seen here and in the couple of other things that I have seen in it do not have the depth or the presence to be a star ... and her behavior outside the screen will tend to indicate that she knows it too. <br /> <br /> The last thing is where was this picture? I do not recognize the external.
