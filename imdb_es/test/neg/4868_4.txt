My Take: routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable turns. <br /> <br /> A little-seen political thriller, which made a very bad box office response, I managed to capture THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on television at the moment, and although I was glad to have satisfied my curiosity to see this weird movie, I did not feel exactly that this movie was special. Given the box office response, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as critics and audiences reacted, but it's still not very good to start and everything, from the script to the direction, is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who is trapped with murderers and persecutions (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy that hides among the staff of the White House. After a teacher is killed, Sheen helps flames reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) discover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, are pedestrians to come, do not differ much from other conspiracy thrillers of the White House as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER IN 1600. Some considerable talents ( Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) do everything possible in a routine script, but rarely saves it from the predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene involving a toy helicopter, which seems too silly and out of place in this "serious" political thriller. The SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments, I'm sure, some of which are very unappreciated (director George Pan Cosmatos presents some decent chase scenes), but none of which raises this suspense routine of which there are not many Rewards or surprises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
