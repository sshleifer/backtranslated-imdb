Well, at least this was the last sequel that I could find in Blockbuster, because this movie was just horrible. I mean, I can understand how difficult it would be to get rid of an evil house. We are talking about starting a horrible fire, excavations, floods, etc. But a mirror? How hard can it be to get rid of a mirror? This was the most horrible movie that could put the title of Amityville in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends that are quite from the beginning, are a lot of monsters. One of them is a photographer of some kind and he buys an enchanted mirror for a homeless man, and he teaches me a valuable lesson. Do not buy things from the homeless man. Of course, horrible deaths and chaos ensue in this group, although I can not imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please, omit Amityville: A new generation, I already have some complaints about my generation. , so I think this was a premonition. Do not sound so crazy. : P But believe me, this is acting horribly, it's not well thought out, and it's not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they must be crying every time a person witnesses this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
