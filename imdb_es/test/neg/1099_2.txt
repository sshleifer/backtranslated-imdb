This begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A group of children are killed in an explosion of the mine by the owner of the mine. Cut to 2006. The recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and the girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. What they do not know is that the ghosts of young children chase the forest and kill anyone who is close to darkness. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring "horror" movie. The premise is obvious and has already been done to death. There are also huge loopholes in logic in history. It is never clear why these children simply kill someone or why they BREAK the bodies afterwards (Yes, it shows). They are already dead, why do they need food? And why have not they got the main villain in the story much earlier? I was in the area. Why choose this moment to attack it? In addition, the characters are not at all pleasant. Sarah meets the worst. It has some saving graces. The location is beautiful and mysterious at the same time, some of the murders were VERY bloody and brutal, and the children themselves looked creepy walking in silence through the forest at night. But overall, I was bored and struggling to stay awake. You can omit this.
