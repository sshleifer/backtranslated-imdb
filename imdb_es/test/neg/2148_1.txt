You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is completely made in a single programmable and cheap synthesizer, without melody or sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how anyone can take this movie seriously, even while I give it a bad review. This movie is far below the "bad". <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is scandalously murdered. In a fight scene, we, the hero (wearing bluejeans and T-shirt), turned a corner with two revolvers in his hand; it doubles, only now it has two semiautomatics in its hands; he turns another corner and now has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases a corridor and comes out (suddenly dressed in a standard army fatigue jacket) with a shotgun; after which he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here is one for books: a bus crashes into a car at high speed; Does the car fly off, thrown by a gigantic explosion, cut off the bus that is completely unharmed by the same explosion? Narrative continuity suffers from an equally disrespectful feeling of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero, obviously, but every time they eliminate him or put him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide that they want him to "live to see this." Eh One of the funniest moments of the movie is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; then the bad guy decides that he will not let the two meet after all; and this despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer know what is happening anyway, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and then we see that another prisoner passes the note to the lawyer, despite that never see the hero give it to him. (This attorney, by the way, has full access to the ATF Offices in California, including his confidential computer files). Hey? Well, but it's a meaningless action movie, so, how are the action scenes? Not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately, they are stolen from a dozen Hong Kong movies made five or ten years earlier. The initial scene, a shooting in a junkyard, actually has shots whose composition is stolen directly from "Hard Boiled," so clearly that it's a wonder that John Woo did not sue for plagiarism. <br /> <Other stolen Hong Kong movies include "Prison on Fire", "Island on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (also known as "Supercop"). I thought I also recognized a couple of Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other movies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can be done with this movie unless it is shot and it just needs a lot. of visual stimuli that do not have to make sense. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
