From time to time, I let my children see this crap so they understand how pathetic the "contestants" of the program are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they acquire their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune. <br /> <br /> For anyone to appear on national television and blubber, sniffle, and complain about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Do you suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The Biggest Loser" is an appropriate title, but it has nothing to do with one's weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute garbage.
