This movie is so terrible that it was literally a chore to watch. I wanted to expel it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but I kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually become fun and that everything would be fine. "You lose, we win, yay!" This movie should be required for anyone who even once entertained himself with the idea that Jackie Mason was funny. After that, hit them in the head with this movie until the tape breaks. And if you are even considering renting this turd (or worse, I have!) I have one thing to ask you: did not you even look at the cover? I mean, with shit like this, you can tell at a glance how bad it is. "Oy vey!" This movie sucks.
