It is rare to see a film that excels in all aspects, but "Caligula" must surely have this title. I'm not sure what is more horrible; Violence, sexual perversity, acting or plot (or serious lack of it). <br /> <br /> The two and a half hours basically follow the ascension of the infamous Roman César "Calígula" to the throne in 37 AD and shows the atrocities and perversities he allegedly committed while in power. The performance is lifeless and boring, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously, knowing that this film lacked something legitimately interesting, the directors decided to include as much nudity and organic scenes as possible. But do not be fooled, these scenes do not diminish or divert attention from the horror of this movie. The work of the camera is of poor quality, the dialogue is ridiculous, in fact, you would have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a serious face through those ridiculous lines. And then there's the violence ... <br /> <br /> If you're about to see the movie, get ready. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not only through writing), but through disgusting violent acts that have little meaning or purpose other than to repel the viewer. This is the only goal that this film achieved. One must ask how the creators of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be attractive to anyone. When it ends late after two and a half hours, you do not take anything from this movie, except for some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have been the worst movie in history. <br /> <br /> You have been warned
