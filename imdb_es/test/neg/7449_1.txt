The first Robocop had a cynical sense and a bad sense of violence. It was a good line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven did it and the film did very well, they made a sequel. Horrible. (Possible Spoilers ahead, although anything that can spoil this surpasses me). <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner is not the director of this kind of movie. Clearly, he did not understand the ingenuity of the original and, as a result, the massive senseless violence seen above looks very bad, and what is worse is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the light and heroic music does not match the images on the screen. What was he writing down? The great American hero? Worst of all, it completely eliminated the Robocop theme of the first movie, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without the fanfare of John Williams, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that do not fit. At first we see Robo "stalking" his former wife. Good, good idea. But, they drop it completely after that. So, there's a stupid idea that the company reprograms Robo to make it nice. It is pulled for 10 minutes and then dropped immediately. Or, the silly idea that the repulsive 10-year-old drug lord reminds Rob of his son: once again, a weak motive that is briefly shown twice and dropped. This may work in a comic, but not in a movie and, unfortunately, Frank Miller was too inexperienced at that time and threw all the ideas along with the kitchen sink. It does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to be praising the corporate attack on this film and the privatization of the police. That is the best part of the movie that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a hard-working businessman for profit, but in the end it was fair. In this movie, he is simply evil in his lust for money and power. You can not change characters like that for no reason. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this film, while in the first it was essential for the search of Theft by itself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the violence, yes, the violence. I enjoy many violent and bloody movies when they serve for purposes and are destined to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to get rid of human beings who are blown to pieces, torn to pieces, children who want death and torture and the desire of people for drugs. He does not know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people who try to help others) get shot? It is deduced when we see the wrong shot of Robocop repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner demonstrates that he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable disaster that is a terrible piece of pop art and, what is worse, a message of disgusting violence for any young man who watches this movie . <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be a message, and I certainly do not watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do should be questioned. And as for this movie, in the last words of the evil child's drug dealer when he dies, "It still stinks."
