This is the voice of a person, who has just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at once, and took the opportunity to see "what happened next": this film takes off where Rome ends. If you find Rome an abomination, an unpleasant dance with a low historical precision, then you could enjoy Imperium: Augustus. But, if you feel that Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the decadent atmosphere and the work of the actors, the Empire will obviously show you as a telenovela too timid, superfluous and tedious, without many exchanges. factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors that look better for me in Rome than these. I especially disliked Rome's image of Cleopatra as a sex addict soaked in drugs. There must have been a lot of strength and dignity in that woman, and the Imperium actress is much better suited to that part. O'Toole and Rampling are good, as are others. But then ... If you know, and love, Atia as the super cool bitch, you will find her representation in Imperium, like a goose mother with tears on an apron, absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some malicious characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily on looking at men and nothing else. You will not find interesting female characters in this epic. There is also Maecenas' painful comedian, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, although there is little historical evidence that he was such (once he is known as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals). <br /> <br /> The interiors are rather scarce and based on clichés on clichés. Cleopatra's great room looks like it's taken from a computer game or a children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There is a huge amount of really poor 3D graphics, not up to the 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of flashbacks that the elderly Augustus is reliving. So we take a quick look at some historical events, some of which show up well, while others do not. A disproportionate amount of time is lost to show Livia as the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This matter does not sparkle for a moment, the dialogue is super lucid and everything is seasoned with a sticky musical score. Whatever the amount of reality that the program aims to capture, each last fragment is destroyed by the dry and synchronized dubbing (most of the actors do not speak English). <br /> <br /> Everything is lukewarm in this epic. It is true that there are more historical details than in Rome, but dramatically speaking, it is simply boring. The characters lack depth and the clarity of the dialogue. Camera work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye. <br /> <br /> There is really no one to love and no one to hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked it or did not like Rome, there are better movies and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The rise and fall of an empire would be a thing I recommend.
