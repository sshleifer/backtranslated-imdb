I'm almost ashamed to admit seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is substandard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to reject it). The address is worse. Most of the film consists of long shots interspersed with close-ups interspersed with cross sections of mostly non-erotic pornography (more prevalent, obviously, in the "uncut" version). The cinematography is especially deficient, which gives the whole production a cheap and faded look that undermines some of the elaborate scenography designs. The movie should have looked much better. The general concept of placing the named actors in what would have easily been a X-rated film (Guccione called it "paganography") fades after the first hour after the departure of Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud. Bob Guccione obviously spent a lot of money on this, but everything seems to be a great waste. If you want a better understanding of the Roman Empire in the first century, see the production of the BBC in the mid-79s of I, CLAUDIUS instead ... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look elsewhere.
