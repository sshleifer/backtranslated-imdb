I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old son. He did not laugh once during the whole movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh at almost anything! This film was horrible from all aspects: bad script (even for a film with G rating for children), bad production (the snapshots of the camera made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), bad performance (maybe they were "directed" act with caricature), and even with poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level seems to be fine, then you can not hear what the next actor says). I'm willing to put up with a lot when it comes to watching a children's movie, but this was worse than having a stick in the eye. I also did not like being hit in the head with the god-heaven-belief thing. In general, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I made a big waste of time in my day!
