It seems that there is a cinema spectrum. On the left, there are movies made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are entertaining and artistic. On the right are the films that are not so commercial, but they are more focused on the cinema than on the art than on the cinema as a product. <br /> <br /> I am not here to say that no part of the spectrum is better than any other. , but when a movie goes too far for either extreme, it is rarely good. Such is the case of Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw it announced. Some friends went and asked me if I wanted to come. None of us knew what to expect, and in the end, none of us was satisfied. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are impressive images. Yes, I am surprised by the scope of the filmmakers in the search for archive images. Yes, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and probably the best part of the experience. The point is that this goes very far from the right side of the spectrum. I mentioned that I can not say anything good about the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's a preaching. It is a mixture of obvious symbolism and morality. It is not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. It's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can find out what he's saying). <br /> <br /> This movie is simply art for the art. An attempt to say "Look how deep and stimulating we can be when using montage!" When a film becomes more about how intelligent or intelligent its creators are than about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes self-gratification of celluloid.
