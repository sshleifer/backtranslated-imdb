It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to bad stories and scripts just for the money. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is just another in a long line of killer thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it look more attractive than it is. Sure, it has some nice locations, it's a polished production, there's a good camera work and editing, and it's pretty well accelerated, in general. <br /> <br /> So, what is the real problem? In short, the whole premise is totally incredible. However, instead of spoiling a rotten story for you, I will make you discover what it is, that is, if you can overcome it. I did it, but only because I like Baldwin and I kept waiting for him to improve. <br /> <br /> It was not like that. And it had one of the most anti-climatic finishes I've seen in a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless, I suppose, if you have nothing better to do.
