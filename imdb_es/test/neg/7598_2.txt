When I first saw this DVD in a bargain pot for three dollars, I really could not believe my luck: a Christmas movie starring Tori Spelling, William Shatner, and Gary Coleman? Needless to say, I took it immediately and considered it an investment worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was as bad as any movie I would expect it to combine Christmas and the three "celebrities" mentioned above. The dialogue was inane, the characters were one-dimensional, and the arch of Carol's characters was completely incredible. The movie itself was a boring and lifeless piece that refused to finish and made me feel used as a human being when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not watch this movie unless you have to. and then only under the influence of a serious holiday punch.
