I had a bit of hope for this one-hour film, composed of images from the old Poverty Row films. Certainly, it had the possibility to seem more than a domestic video marketed to the world. Unfortunately, while the movie is fun, it still feels like a home movie, but with spliced ​​footage. <br /> <br /> The plot refers to the planned reading of a testament on a midnight ocean liner somewhere in the tropics. The ship is sinking and well ... that's the movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others will rise from old movies to interact with new images. We understand it well, but above all we get a lot of new video images so that they look like a black and white film, in which the new actors stand out. The old images are interspersed mainly to establish the scene, but very little of the old and the new actually coincide, so it is evident that it is only put. It is not very convincing and it is very disappointing for someone like me who was looking for a better built movie. <br /> <br /> Even if you know and love the old Poverty Row movies, (it's very false) this might be worth it. visit. I would like to warn you not to buy this, but you can get it for about five dollars (the rental price), so the choice is yours (although if you can get away with it without paying), click here. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
