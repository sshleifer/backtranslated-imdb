When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or a garbage. Guess which category falls ONLY. Apparently derived from a popular science fiction novel, WEAPON, SOLO is starring Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot that decides to think for itself and, therefore, is the goal of its elimination. It hides in a Mexican town, obviously to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is on his way, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles. Van Peebles manages to beat them all easily, of course, while Corbin observes all this with bewilderment from afar. The film is a horrible scam of the series THE TERMINATOR and CYBORG, and apparently has little to do with the original material. It is horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end is downright funny. Van Peebles, a decent actor somewhere else, is a shout when he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. It seems he's doing Robot Dance most of the time.
