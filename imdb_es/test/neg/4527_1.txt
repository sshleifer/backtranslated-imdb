This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. A lot of talent wasted. Who let this bomb go? When Sigfried says that an example should be given, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said: "Please, let this theater be!" Do not waste your time. It's not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill out the comments section in IMDb? I can not believe that someone who has seen the original series has enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they eliminated the "comedy" and turned it into a direct action movie, it could happen. What was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, jokes and fat references were in bad taste. This film never lost the opportunity to choose the lowest common denominator and the scenes that had just ended, it seemed, as if no one had thought of them. Simply unpleasant! Save your time, if it's not money and give this movie a pass!
