I have never seen this movie by itself, but like many others that have already commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible television of the 70s. But someone saw its potential because it has only become a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And to the person who asked if SOME movies were made in the 70s, I want to remind you that it was a golden age for American cinema, with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese, who became theirs. Not to mention little things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70's were much more creative than the 21st century so far.
