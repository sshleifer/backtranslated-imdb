SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not enter "high-tech" movies, expecting them to be 100% accurate in everything related to the computer. But somehow, even the average user of "I have a computer" is supposed to believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) A computer professional with a special secret, special data <br /> <br /> 2) is to keep the primary copy of such data on a diskette 1.44 <br /> <br /> 3) and we will absolutely NOT ANY SUPPORT of this special secret data <br /> <br /> Even high school students They will make a backup of their goodness tasks. <br /> <br /> This is also the worst representation of a computer nerd. Even though she is super cute, we are supposed to believe that she does not have friends, neighbors, relatives or coworkers who can identify her. Even the Unabomber had a family that could deliver it. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> These are not just minor errors that were not related to the movie: these are the main plot points that fed the plot. The characterization was horrible, the plot completely inescapable, and if you have not seen this, do not worry.
