One of the commentators on the subject of Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove), did well when he said that the movie is really bad, but I make an exception when he commented on the animation. <br /> <br /> The animation was not bad due to Macromedia Flash. It was bad animation because it was misdirected. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create animations as complete and fluid as any Disney movie and, in the wrong hands, can look as bad as things on the Internet, which is where Lil 'Pimp originated and should have stayed there. . <br /> <br /> Studies such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create a wonderful animation with Flash (ie, Puffy Ami Yumi, the House of Foster for Imaginary Friends, Lucha Lucha, etc.). <br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was a piece of ill-conceived gut that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the properties included. Roth and the company thought they would make money quickly by exploiting an uncle like Lil 'Pimp and the farce was perpetuated by their producer, Amy Pell. The reason for this third-quarter abortion of an animated movie is that none of the Revolution Studios executives had the intelligence to put aside Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really did everything possible, but they hired real writers), directors and at least one semi-competent producer. However, they did one thing correctly, they hired some of the best scriptwriters, designers and animators in Los Angeles, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, you can buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you're an imbecile, you can ruin it safe.
