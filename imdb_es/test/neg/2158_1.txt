I can not see how anyone can say that this was a very good entertaining movie. With a few well-known actors, I found it hard to believe that this was only done in 2005. It sucks! The acting is equivalent to amateur dramas, bad amateur dramatics. Unless you want to laugh out loud at the incredible 100 minutes of pure corn, do not bother to download or rent it, the worst I've seen in years. It is from the last days of the performance, where the cowboys are firing 8 bullets from the six shooters. The more the actor was known, the worse they were, Drury was sad. I felt extremely disappointed with Lee Majors, have you really turned to this kind of garbage? It was bad enough when the six million dollar man played.
