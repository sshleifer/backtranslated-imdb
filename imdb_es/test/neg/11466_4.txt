Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing movie of Fantasy-Action-Adventure, which despite having some scenes of genius fades with its uncomfortable rhythm , its poor characterization and general boredom Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of the army of the queen Isabel that fights in Africa, where it is face to face with the Devil's Reaper. a demon that collects the debts of the devil, that is, the souls? Still refusing to go to hell, he evades Reaper and begins a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and, instead, now embraces the values ​​of peace and non-values. But once he is expelled from the monastery due to fear that the Devil's Reaper will return, he must travel back to his home in Devon and on the way befriends a family of Puritans traveling to the New World. On his journey through the British counties, the family is attacked, and his daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is kidnapped by the evil wizard Malachi's army, which is led by the mysterious masked Rider. Now that he is a man of peace, Solomon must return to his previous life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite having a great source of material to work with, and build to create an exciting and enduring medieval film of action and adventure, the film fails in three key areas. The tempo of this movie is terrible, which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short execution time of just one hour and forty minutes (and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogy). Constantly jumping from drama and self-characterization to that of action and bloodshed muddy, somehow kills the emotion of action sequences. Instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats with the anticipation of the eagle's eyes, the film feels incredibly tenuous and, this follows in the next, boring review. Despite being touted as an 'action-adventure' movie or in some circles an 'action-epic', 'Solomon Kane' is almost certainly not. The action is mundane and boring, and usually ends before you have the opportunity to admire the beauty of a beheading. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization within this film. For example, we know little and, because of this, we care little about the young woman Soloman embarks on his journey to save. And I imagine once again that the filmmaker would recommend this criticism to the fact that there is likely to be a second film that, hopefully, touches these aspects that this film was surely lost. <br /> <br /> It's not a However, a completely terrible movie. James Purefoy has a fantastic performance as Solomon, the mercenary who must decide whether or not to relapse on his conscience or his sword, and how his decisions will affect not only him, but also those around him. While respect, admiration and recognition must also go to Bassett and his team, to create vivid locations that beautifully reflect the period in which they are filming. Sometimes, it's hard not to get carried away by the admiration of the beauty of the locations, the composition of shots and the staging shown here. What certainly shows that much time and effort has been devoted to this film, unfortunately, is not the same for the story and the characters in question. "Solomon Kane" certainly had the potential to be more than just an "epic action", however, it seems that, once again, the lack of real depth in the story and the characters has resulted in Michael Bassett not believing more than a character. Dimensional look at the game of the sword during the medieval period.
