It's amazing that a Yuppie anguish movie so loaded with clich√©s has actually been made in the first place. The characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to worry about any of them, especially the Brooke Shields. The temptation to move through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, it is better to rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
