Corey Haim plays a boy who joins a dog to get a giant troll and a hitman from the OSA (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (which are plausible considering Haim) Oh, and also he protects his mother and girlfriend also in this observable but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible, of course, but the great impulse of the film, as well as the imposing presence of Ironside, make this at least a modestly effective film. Still, the plot is ridiculous and it would have been better if we could have seen a monster or at least more blood. At least it is something different. It is also quite likely that this movie is the last movie for teenagers for a while to show a teenager doing tube bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
