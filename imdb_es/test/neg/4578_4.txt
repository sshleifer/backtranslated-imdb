This movie defines the word "confused". All the actors remain true to the script. More is worth it, because the performance is fine, but the script is a confused pasture of random pseudo-psychoanalytic ideas. The rhythm is as slow as the mind, and the soft-focus lens cinematography gets on nerves quickly. I give it 4 out of 10.
