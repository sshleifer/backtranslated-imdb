Where to start with 'Speck' the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the very low budget Full Moon Liberation movies (such as the Rite of Birth) and here works from a script of Don Adams, the usual of the Full Moon (at that time). Unfortunately, while the film seems an accurate representation of the horrendous crime, the script is not great, perhaps because the ramblings of the real Speck were not very interesting. Despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic, it is a cheap charge of the acclaimed films of serial cinematic killers of the same period (as 'Ed Gein'). Filmed in a dirty brown, not entirely sepia, for the most part and narrated by the star Doug Cole, the film does not present the horror of the crime because the narrative is irritating, the color distracts attention from the story and the crime, although frightening and annoying See, it's just that, and it does not seem that there has been any editorial work on what is more or less a very poor quality video camera at events. There is not an examination of Speck's motivation or life really, just a cheap shot to a frightening crime. Released by Full Moon, there is little evidence of the best result of Full Moon here, Charles Band ignores his own rule that his films present fantasy murders (eg, dolls, monsters, etc.) and do not know what to do with this new reality . Incidentally Band introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. Band has said he regrets the production period of Full Moon with Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and the usual Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The era of Tempe presents a uniform edition of Apple Mac and a brutal camera shoot in hand, much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and while Witchouse 3, for example, managed to use them well, Speck is simply boring and coarse.
