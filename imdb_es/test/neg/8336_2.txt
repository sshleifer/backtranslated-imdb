A horrible mix of predictable story lines and PC clich√©s intertwined with the poor became crazy (the races work together, the heroine is smart and pretty too, a guy who sacrifices himself to save another life, a father / daughter relationship , etc etc.). The movie seems something created for network television and probably should have stayed there. Even the talented Tommy Lee Jones can not save this BOMB. I urge you not to waste time or money on this movie ruin from the moment when disaster films roamed Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The two stars are awarded only to CGI people and the ability of public relations people to get even a movie-goer to sit through it.
