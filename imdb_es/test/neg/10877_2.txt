Quentin Tarantino once said that to be successful in the film industry you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken that advice too literally with Hell Ride and made an unpleasant tribute that lends itself too much in his visuals, music, camera work and narrations that alter time. But to properly imitate a Tarantino movie, one has to have a knack for building creative conversations; Unfortunately, the main element of the derailment of Hell Ride are its disgusting ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to displease and confuse the public while at the same time invoking the compassion of the actors just to be involved. <br /> <br /> The Victors, consists of several tanned vigilantes who carry their own brand of justice thirsting for blood to the lawless roads. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is determined to take revenge and put out fires. The Gent (Michael Madsen) only tries to balance his chaotic and psychotic symphony of life with the leadership of the one who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows him with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the villainous front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the brain that organizes from afar, though not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and aroused explanations about his tattoos while charging a harpoon weapon and a general contempt for life. While these characters may sound interesting on paper, once they are forced to chant horribly ill-conceived dialogues, all traces of sympathy disappear faster than the funds for Bishop's next film should. <br /> <br /> While Hell Ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its ruin lies in poorly designed conversations. And since Bishop's main influences are Tarantino's films, there are many of them. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost unintelligible and would probably make a lot of sense to silence them. The moment Pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and too many phrases are used to the point of nausea, you will pray for death and the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble staying cool while uttering such a silly dialogue. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or a phrase so many times that it just does not sound right or makes no sense? Bishop starts there and then the madness continues until you envy the characters on the screen and cut off their heads. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, they give us interspersed shots of naked female oil fights and throat cuts. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped to get, but I doubt he found it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wants to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino's films, Robert Rodriguez's films and all the movies that idolize the violent and violent. Diabolical attitudes of cyclists. But while their intentions may be noble, the tremendously distorted dialogue and the hyper-stylized line style editing prevent the audience from getting involved with the generic characters of the rough type. When we discover the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be a while before you realize that there is a mystery to be solved), it is too difficult to care for. And although everyone on the screen is clearly enjoying themselves, they have completely forgotten to translate any of these entertainments to the audience. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
