I'm from Romania ... and that's why I apologize if my English is not so good. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and I must say that I am extremely disappointed. I've always liked the Wesley Snipes movies, but this one is terrible. I regret spending more than 3 hours downloading this movie. There are many errors in the movie. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium marker is not capable of displaying graphic images: video replays, live images, etc. It is a simple marker that can only show letters and numbers. The opponents of the team Uli (Seaua) are shown on the scoreboard as Din (probably Dinamo Bucuresti, who are the main rivals of Steaua in the Romanian football championship). The football match images are from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love, look it up on the Internet and you'll see why). The police cars in the movie are not made correctly. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! Everyone is white! The "error list" can go on and on and on ... but I'll stop here! In short, this movie is horrible. It's not worth renting, it's not worth buying a movie ticket, it's not worth it to download! Honestly, I'm sorry that Wesley snipes has played in this movie. An earlier film of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... it was good, but this is terrible!
