The tracking of Irvine Welsh to Trainspotting appears on the screen with three stories in Edinburgh, all with some of Welsh's trademarks, drug culture, depression, working class and Hibernia football club. Uncomfortable to see in some places, it is no less than very well written, two of the stories have a dark and comic turn, while the second story is a serious (and surprisingly realistic) plot. I will not appeal to the majority, including myself at one point, but will no doubt adopt a cult.
