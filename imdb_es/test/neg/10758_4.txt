How someone can praise this raw version of the movie after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> Myra of MAE CLARKE is very far from the role that VIVIEN LEIGH played in the remaking. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yes" answers are somewhat discordant when one expects a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in late credits like KENT DOUGLASS) is tremendously unlikely as a soldier hit with her no matter how many times she disappoints him. BETTE DAVIS has nothing to do with paper. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are incredible (extravagant fragments of overacting), even taking into account the fact that this is coarser. version of the story when the sound was only a few years old and the silent performance was still rage. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible. And it ends abruptly with Clarke losing his life during a bombing on the bridge. The End. <br /> <br /> It does not have any of the beautifully shaded performances in the MGM remake of 1940, including an excellent cast. Instead, this is assembled with low budget production values ​​(and I mean a shoe string budget) without any subtlety at all. And there is no precoded bravery in the scene in which Myra tells the aristocrat why she should not marry her son, Roy. She simply says: "I picked it up at the Waterloo Bridge." Explanation about. Nothing daring there. <br /> <br /> In summary: for once, the original is not the best version in any way. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed like Myra and Roy in the tender, classic of the 1940 film, of exquisite performance.
