Seagal was very far from the brand with this movie. I'm a fan of his and I can expect great fight scenes and extraordinary phrases, but this movie did not have any of this, instead I had injections and corny music. Even if you are a fan of it, I recommend that you stay away from this movie and that you look in a state of siege or even deadly terrain.
