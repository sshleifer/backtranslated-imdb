It is time for both critics and American fans begin to discredit his venerated and unquestioning veneration of films like Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America". The checkered history of this opulent film (and the great fantasy myth associated with its production and many versions) belies its mediocrity at the narrative level. The film wobbles back and forth, adapts and begins, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of imposing ensembles, the minutiae of the details of production and, in 1984, clich√© but magnificent cinematographic confection on offer for the audience. The time frame of the plot is confusing, sophisticated and laborious, which leads some critics to imagine that the opium of the figure of Noodles is the antecedent of a future "reality of dream", as well as the memories in sepia tones. This apologetic, overly fanatical and apologetic interpreter ignores the obvious narrative irregularities that are shown. Even in this full time (?) Of execution, the figures appear and disappear with an alarming speed: the character of Deborah is established fleetingly in infantile form, a cold and unattainable 'trophy' woman, who does not even hint at the gravity with which will be established again In its relationship with a post-prison Noodles, this union from now on sounds completely false. The deadly rhythm is something to blame, certain sequences creep up tightly for too long, which means very little, insinuating a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels compelled to usurp every jot of possible screen time to show Of its production, fatal for a film that contains so sullen and distant figures. The trajectory of the life of the figures is presented to us as a microcosm that reflects the historical trajectory of the adolescents of the United States through the prohibition and their booty, which ends with the (questionable) ruin of their moribund central figures (except Deborah, a department of machining, fumble or intentional one wonders). This notion is common, even banal. The cast of characters as imagined in the script of a single note (written by seven Italians, no less) is played flat and uncomfortable by all, except for the younger actors, who at least venture some varied facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost non-viable material. Some critics claim that the characters may seem impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own objectives, assuming compliance with others (for example, when Noodles is released from jail, Max picks him up and offers him a prostitute without asking him if he is or not). this is what he wants and then he makes deals assuming that Noodles will comply). This explanation of its abrupt and abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily strange and simply serves to highlight the complicated purposes to which the unconditional people will go to defend their positions with respect to a film that, unfortunately, has no meaning. Although the score of Ennio Morricone is highly revered, it is undeniably mean and repetitive, it springs with an emotional tone that the scenes themselves, many of them violent, simply do not justify. At some points it is questionable if Morricone was watching the same movie in which I was as incongruous as his work is. As a song to American Filmmaking, he is successful in terms of mood (aided by a few strokes of masterful editing between periods of time) and visuals (not helped by that score), but lacks narrative cohesion and fluency.
