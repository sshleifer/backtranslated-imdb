What could have been a great movie about the late poker professional (madness before poker) Stu "The Kid" Unger became a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can say that the filmmakers were working on a short chain. budget. Everything is filmed on the cheap. The timelines seemed a bit strange to me. <br /> <br /> Choosing Michael Imperoli from the Sopranos was also a bad choice. He seemed too old to play the baby-faced Stu, he seemed too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at the images of the main event of the WSOP in 1997, the real Stu was very thin and practically had no nose because of too much cocaine. so he used those sunglasses to hide them), and I kept waiting for Adriana to appear and shout "Chris-tu-phur!" <br /> <br /> They also skipped the fact that he had a son from Angie's previous relationship who committed suicide in the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> Every time he saw Vincent Van Patten, I kept thinking I was going to announce "Show melodies in Stu's head". as it does in the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for real images of Stuey, check out ESPN Classic because they rerun the 1997 WSOP Main Event every so often. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad blow.
