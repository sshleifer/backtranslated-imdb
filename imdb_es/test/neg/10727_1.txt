Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humor and personally I think he is a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example). <br /> <br /> However, this movie is probably nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so bear in mind right away that if you do not think your comedy style is fun, you will feel with a stone face throughout this film, since it has NOTHING more to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure if this movie is fun for you. I went to see him on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They laughed along the trailers, which were not particularly fun, but when it came to the movie, the stony silence. I think it caused five genuine laughs. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it does not know what it wants to be. You can not decide if you are serious or not. If it were stupid, you could forgive, but (I suppose) it's also about making a point about the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the film is control. Ups, and there was a lot of potential here. But these did not start until about half and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit for the first 40 minutes, as the couple's life deteriorates. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups came out of this movie while I was there, and if my roommate had not asked me to continue away from home (his girlfriend had just returned from a month-long vacation), I would have done the same. And in my 25 full years of film, I've done it only once before.
