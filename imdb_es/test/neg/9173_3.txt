What can I say ... not much to this at all. Quite boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are fine. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can not help feeling that his talent was wasted. Nobody else rose above the mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be intriguing at first, but it just does not go anywhere. There was not a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like I had just seen something special. The photograph was quite insipid ... I mean desert in a kind of faded sepia ... not very inspiring. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood friend back in prison seemed only partially thought out and he did not. It really adds something to the story, apart from converting an average 'Twilight Zone' script into a full-length function. <br /> <br /> Drab.
