This film was recommended to me by some academics. From his comments, I had some pretty high expectations. But this movie was just disappointing. The goal of the director is obvious: use an interweaving of speeches / poems to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably in this. I also seriously question the choice of the director of the main character. He is a vagabond who is definitely not worthy to be heard. The rise of the power of the corporation, so what? The most important thing is that this movie gets a poor score in its persuasive power; It is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasant. But almost everything else in the movie just sucks.
