He was a fan of the film AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and, therefore, he was curious to know if a sequel of 16 years later could be made with the French language and the local reissue of the main, secondary and support characters. Tonight I saw the version "edited for FOX Network" that was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The scriptwriters and directors pay tribute to some of the key concepts of the plot: the tourist suffers the bite of a wolf, the moon is full, the child knows the girl, the child becomes a beast, the child dies heroically after the help of the ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this "formula" of horror special effects for teenagers was the cast of the school's love interest for the television comedy "ED" as one of the clueless victims of the werewolf that is more or less totally unpleasant in the The dashed lines gave him. I have not seen another horror movie that this film is "sequential" (a vampire fight movie called BLADE), but I think parts of its plot must explain how werewolf villains (they are fake) are threatening the "good guys" . Couple of werewolves during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris underground train, at SPEED. This studio product from 1997 is a strange hybrid of a film, since there are considerable technical effects with frightening purposes but, in my opinion, the real terrors of the original have been undermined. What a strange rewrite of the werewolf legend and the "mythology of the movie"!?! My suggestion for those who are considering this in the video store: opt for a classic "top of the line" Thriller: the PSYCHO of Alfred Hitchcock!
