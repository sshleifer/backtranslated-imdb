It hurts me to see an impressive movie become a lazy, repetitive and lazy series. It is full of holes in the plot and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Whoever the puncture writers who decided to turn such a big movie into this garbage, should have researched a bit, instead of filling it with simple sentences and new, hollow characters, and the classic jokes of the first movie. AGAIN. Of course they get a little creative, but it's like watching the same episode with a little twist. Pretty like listening to Creed, or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent him from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone asks the monkey and the bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she dissuades without sounding like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "Director Amzy" and calls Kronk, and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit, this show has its moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks ... weird. Also, nobody can replace David Spade and John Goodman! They are the ones made by Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! I'm sorry, but I give this show two thumbs down.
