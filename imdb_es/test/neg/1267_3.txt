The film is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you have not seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point. <br /> <br /> This movie raises several questions. First, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the NSA decided to ask you to pick it up and turn it in first. Is there an innocent explanation of why he received phone calls from what the NSA believes is a terrorist? If there is one, the film does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie unsatisfactory enough for me. It is good to make statements about whether the torture is right or wrong, but first show that you tortured the wrong person, then take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps, we were well trained to resist to a certain point and then pretend that we collapsed and give answers that can be proven wrong with a little investigation, so we tend to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man so that confess without being really guilty. However, there is nothing in the movie that proves that he is guilty. <br /> <br /> The other loose ends that exist are: 1. Therefore, a dishonest CIA agent releases him and takes him back home. What prevents the NSA from picking it up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please, give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to take the risk to intervene on his behalf, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA has been tracking the phone numbers that are being called by whom, why could not they hear some of the calls to find out if something serious is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid anyway. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells will process his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not one that can be traced back to him and his home. <br /> <br /> The whole movie revolves around throwing in the hearts of the spectators showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But when you think about it in more depth, there is nothing of substance in this movie, just a lot of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what is that ?!" at the end of the movie.
