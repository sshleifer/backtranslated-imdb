This movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts to feel "good" and informal that it really embarrassed me to see it. I can not imagine how the inner circle of celebrities and the Norwegian press should have felt trying to pretend that they like it at the star-studded premiere. His excellent media reviews are a disgusting example of how ridiculous and small the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached the silver screen, it would have received the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, home-style visual effects, uncomfortable dialogues, painfully. The idle attempts at the humor of the working class and the too cozy and meaningless plot really make this a quality film in the background. Keep away.
