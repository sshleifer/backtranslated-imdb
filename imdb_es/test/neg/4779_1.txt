I have to say that this movie was not what I expected. Even though I have not read the book, the fact that the plants can be a bait and then wait for a slaughter to occur just to drag a corpse for lunch is the worst scenario that has been presented. With the ruins of the title, one would think that of the 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another primitive film in which one would think it was something strange that the villagers fear more, but not a crocodile. Anyway, this movie was like that, it prompts you to think about the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore that result in the awakening and the old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something like that. But the plants? ... come on, is there nothing more that the producers can create to astonish the crowd? As for this movie, it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore were excellent to watch, but they did not make up for the rest of the movie. And a plant that mimics the sound of a cell phone or the voices of people is too much to believe. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a fan of stereotypes that only uses gore or mechanical effects. I trust the great suspense and what will be the next scene that will bring more suspense. The thing had a better story than this one. Even the ring made me jump for more, but the ruins are just that ... ruined by using a plant to convince the victims to kill or the villagers to kill them. The premise was good for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such, but even so a simple blowtorch and a bunch of napalm can do the trick to get rid of those annoying plants with an eating disorder of the flesh.
