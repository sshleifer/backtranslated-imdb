While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced to have sexual intercourse throughout the days by three hooded women. When he is released, the director of his company, Isabel (Greta Scacchi), already replaced him in the work and his girlfriend receives him coldly. The disturbed and humiliated Daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to search for the kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women who he suspects could be the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation" is a strange movie with a promising start that loses the initial power and becomes a kind of erotic soap opera that is too long or of soft and pornographic elegance. The production is elegant, the cover of the DVD is impressive, but the characters are not well developed and the trauma of Daniel seems to be excessive, since most of the men fantasize about the dream situation they presented to him. To become sex object of three sexy women. The melodramatic development with Isabel's disease does not add any value to the plot; The open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the women's motive or title. It is very clear that the script about a man's feelings was written by a woman. It was good to see the still beautiful Greta Scacchi again and her makeup at the end is impressive. There is a saying in Portuguese that could be translated into English as follows: "If the violation is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should have done this and kept me from seeing almost two hours of a meaningless story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("The Book of Revelations")
