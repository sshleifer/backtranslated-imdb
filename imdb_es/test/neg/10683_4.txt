I was willing to hate this, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable, although the MTV filming style (filmed in DV, to boot) is quite painful! I liked the self-mocking style of the script, as well as its central idea that the female vampire doubled as a hit man. As for the cast, Eileen Daly (better known as the "star" of those horrible intros of "Redemption") has an undeniable presence on the screen, and is quite sensual, despite her age; However, the evil boss hammy of Christopher Adamson is unpleasant. David Warbeck has a brief role as a doctor (dubbed "The Horror-Movie Man"!) Who performs an autopsy on one of the vampire's victims; It seems that the film took a long time to shoot, since Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence at hand, but it does not make much sense (especially because its subplot that involves a secret society of vampires that infiltrate power structures is barely developed); The movie is also too long for its purpose, and eventually slips into boredom during the last half hour.
