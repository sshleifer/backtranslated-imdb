This movie does not know what it wants to be: are you making fun of action movies in general? Is it satirical? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? This is really one of the worst movies that have ever been made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There, I said what everyone else is thinking. It is bad enough that she is such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she does not even qualify as a mediocre movie actress. His shrill voice, his strange manners and his poor comical timing dot this film from beginning to end, until you just want to put your head on a screw and end the pain. Film at all costs. You'll be glad you did it.
