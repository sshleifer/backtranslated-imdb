I ... There are no words. There are no words that can describe this. I'll try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives in their toasters ... after watching this show. <br /> <br /> This ... person from Cosgrove ... His performance is like watching a female gorilla dance on the nest of very agitated insects. Maybe I exaggerate. However, I have the feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show. <br /> <br /> The characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies towards the sun. On any day of the week. Although we have not experienced heart attacks while watching them act like fools in cheap construction sets, I have no doubt that it will happen over time. <br /> <br /> The main plot of this * burps loudly on the faces of the Actors * is that of a silly girl who presents a live webcast on the web creatively iCarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which owns equipment that the producers of this program probably could not pay. His legal guardian is a kind of imbecile who apparently is his older brother. <br /> <br /> I have not seen all this show for fear of developing cancer, or maybe a cold, but some of the points of the plot are I've seen the brother involved who gets stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dies and the fattest priest in the world comes to visit. Not seriously. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are of legal age or have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. If you decide to see it, laugh when the hint of laughter tells you to, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. <br /> <br /> The program receives a one-star rating because the IMDb has inexplicably not adopted the use of negative numbers.
