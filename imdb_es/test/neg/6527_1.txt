Let's clarify one thing; This was bad! It is so rotten that it does not even qualify to be printed in anyone's memories. <br /> <br /> The story that repeats itself (who constantly recycles not only the jokes but also the stories and appearances of the characters). A typical story is the following. ; Sue (the mother) opens the episode by citing how she loves her baby, but smells really bad (as if THAT does not get old! Har-de-bloody-har!), An Australian quasi-nationalist "bogan". She even seems to say that she thinks it's amazing because it's a zozona, while everything / everyone else is not a shit before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a little mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot revolves around the father (Gary) engaging in a kind of disagreement with Sue and him talking to the members of his band for advice on how to solve it. <br /> <br /> The phrase "words fail me" is an old one, but this is where it is as sincere as can be said. It is incredibly BAD! So HORRIBLE, I would like all traces of your existence to be sent to the lowest depths of the North Sea and life can continue. <br /> <br /> However, I am sad to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (good actress, I like her) to do a prat of herself, Ardal O Hanlon (apart from my hero) has the ability to be very funny, but not here, and Ben Elton, distinguished by so many good things, somehow manages to get to this ... thing then the comedy is in serious trouble
