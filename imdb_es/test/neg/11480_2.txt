This should be renamed "Everyone loves Sebastian." The rural junior from the city of Go-nowhere in 1983 (or senior? - seemed like that flip-flop on that) with strange hair and a good "Leo-like" look has a big plate full of problems. His stepfather announces definitive plans for a sex change operation, about which his mother declares that the marriage is closed; Sebastian is called the word "f" by everyone and his mother, while "kissing" with several girls, they are up to Ready-Whip in a supermarket and save a "strawberry" prostitute from the clutches of his ruthless pimp . <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "friends" make Eddie Haskal look like a choirboy; The bad association does not get much worse. Sebastian seems to bet on the record of suicide attempts of "Harold" (although it does not admit suicidal tendencies). For no apparent reason, the SAT score of the genius level MUST be graduated a year before, although he has no idea about the future, nor does he want to go to university (what's the use of this nonsense?) The film is a look a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will be fine, although HOW is left entirely to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film seem to rely solely on the undisputed appeal of the attractive male leader. The "history" leaves much to be desired. Searching "What will this beautiful child do next ...?" it does not exactly satisfy The lackluster production values ​​are simply not up to the standards of other films, independent or otherwise. A low budget and a weak history need more than a pretty face to carry it out. The "results" of this project are forgettable and an insult for smart film fans.
