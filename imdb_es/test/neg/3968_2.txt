This film was obtained from the mother of my friend who worked in a charity store. She gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. The movie itself is a bit trash. There are some remarkable things to laugh about, like the one he does when his girlfriend is pierced, but in general the movie is bland. Interstingly when I saw the trailer for "The Island" I could not help noticing the similarities. Could Clonus have been the inspiration for that movie? All in all, do not bother watching this movie, as it is boring and boring. We enjoyed it so much when we were 16 years old that we named our band. Another sign that this movie is a bit horrible is that the shots on the back of the video cassette do not appear in the movie. strange
