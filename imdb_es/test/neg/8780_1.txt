I remember very well the bad press that had this movie because of the court order of the producers against Clayton Moore who uses the name "Lone Ranger" or puts his black mask on personal appearances. Apart from any consideration of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of myopic arrogance and stupidity on the part of producers and their lawyers. And I suspect that the lesson was well learned after this movie collapsed, which was perceived as a kind of karma for the idiots responsible for the court order against Moore. the custom, when reliving a movie or a legendary television project, invite the star or original stars for the appearances, and rightly so. Show some respect, idiots! And even if they grimace at the prospect, what has happened, at least the offer was made. This is positive proof that film producers, studio executives and entertainment lawyers are not stupid and arrogant enough to teach them the example.
