A really absurd and meaningless garbage. This movie does everything wrong, except that the execution time in less than an hour. The gore FX defies gravity and logic. There are no fears. The acting is abysmal, since everyone seems to be reading their lines. There is a surprising ending that is simply silly when we discover that the things we saw that happened did not even happen. What I hate the endings! They fill this thing with long shots of people who do not do anything interesting (like putting on makeup or talking about what seems to be forever). Do you have to fill out a movie that lasts less than an hour? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty fucking thin. I mean it's just a variation of the movie APRIL FOOL'S DAY, if I remember the movie correctly, and that movie was not that good either. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have been well filmed. Pity that nothing happens, that's very exciting.
