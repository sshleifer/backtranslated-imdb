Occasionally, in the talk shows, a good thematic debate awakens some interesting opinions from the audience. Unfortunately, there is always a desperately sad person who seeks acceptance and who will end any interesting debate by getting up and saying the proverbial thing: "Everyone should get along and love each other." As you know, they are guaranteed to receive applause and affirmations, since no one would dare to disagree. <br /> <br /> Well, it's the same people who marked this movie as good, why did they do that? INSECURITY. Anyway, that's all I'll say about it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite interestingly, so you expect it to be built, and if like me, you settled down with a couple of glasses of wine and some cheese, then you will give even more possibilities simply because you can not bother moving. <br /> <br /> But then you dream awake, vague, your mind wanders towards other things, why? ? Because the Director did it too! He took his foot off the accelerator, and then he realized that, to compensate, he accelerates a lot, but then he goes back to deviate and, again, the story slows down, the plot thins out and almost disappears, you even ask. 'So, what happened again?' while he reflects on his screen, he will see Nick Nolte running with some supposed purpose, but for a long time he will care what he is doing and will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the depths of his day dreaming. <br /> <br /> Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or face, as if he were a ventriloquist, he should have attended Nicolas's school of facial expression without expression Cage was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector. <br /> <br /> Tuesday Weld went to play Marge Converse, but instead she played Mia Farrow to perfection. <br /> <br /> In all there are hundreds of thousands of movies to see, so leave it in one of the last ones, you see, I only lost one night looking at it when I could have looked or done something else, learn from my mistake, Rest nights are beautiful, so do not waste your time watching this. boring tale, do anything else, dust off that old Cluedo game, practice gurni Look for the night or discuss with a loved one, cut the hair on your nose, get rid of the files you do not use on your laptop, it will be a better time what you should choose.
