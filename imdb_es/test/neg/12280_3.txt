Essentially the action movie without an argument has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) faced against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most charismatic action initiative of the 80s, the small part of Roundtree is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another embarrassing role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughter in "The Toolbox Murders" (this man was once a respected actor, now he has come to use flowers on his hair and complain about people bleeding on his carpet). Only Stack Pierce acts with a certain dignity. As for violence, do not worry: most of it is wrong to offend someone. (* 1/2)
