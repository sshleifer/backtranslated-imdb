It was not until I saw Sidney Pollack in the photo that I connected him to this movie. This is your worst possible movie. Absolute Dreck. The dialogue is wooden and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There is nothing in your character that makes you want to believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is like in Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is horrible, and he's too smart not to see that. So it smells like some kind of reward, whether it's a study obligation or something else, but this is just BLOODY ROTTEN!
