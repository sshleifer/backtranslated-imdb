I have read all the complementary publications on this confusing semi-noir and I am baffled by what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a product of the late RKO assembly line very neglected. All those endless documentary images of fish, waves, fish, waves have little to do with the central conflict and only cover the execution time. The editing is totally neglected: the scenes simply end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue shows the forced traces of the origins of Odets: high-flying metaphors that could never have come from the limited imagination of these people who work today. But what really surprises is how horribly exaggerated the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snarls, writhes and lashes out violently, an undisciplined performance several notches below her level. Douglas, exaggerating the fact of being nice, then gets into a possible murderous assault and is similar to a hammy, like Ryan, who grunts and screams unnaturally. The second less interesting pair at least provides a recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is a Neanderthal by today's standards, however, is soft and persuasive like Stanwyck's brother (much younger, it is assumed), and Marilyn Monroe , as his girlfriend. It is natural and is not affected. On the windswept Monterey coast (and all of Monterey's images, though largely irrelevant, are interesting as a document on the appearance of the city), in the midst of superheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. One end point and one spoiler: maybe Breen's office ordered it, but does anyone believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may have temporarily returned to being an obedient wife, but I give the marriage a month.
