The actors are so bland that it's almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said about this movie: "The actors have names, but they are truly anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging from the wires and recycle the trick that allows Fred Astaire to dance on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these guys moves well enough to make it sound convincing). <br /> <br /> The low point of the film is when one of the characters, an aircraft magnate, is trying to convince other "industry giants" to join him in a lunar rocket consortium , and he shows them a cartoon by Woody Woodpecker that explains how a rocket works at a second-grade level. (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that the production design manages to communicate a kind of sensitivity of "Amazing Stories", and even that gets much better . in the later film of the producer (George Pal) "When Worlds Collide", which has a similar bad performance, but is much more entertaining. However, Pal's best science fiction film has to be "The Time Machine".
