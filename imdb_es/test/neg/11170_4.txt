The brutal and almost black Robert Aldrich comedy "The Grissom Gang", a reworking of the 1948 British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish", has the heiress of the 1920s Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; Soon, he is sent to that gang and then poor Kim is transferred to the clutches of another crooked group: third-rate mafia brothers with sweaty, doughy faces, and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in the drag. At first, Darby (not very brave and not very smart) tries to escape from this drooling calf, but they are on it. Finally, she simply stops trying, and therein lies the problem with the story. Are we in the audience to sympathize with her? Is your growing concern for family ingenuity supposed to be touching? These are disgusting, cretinous characters, and I wanted to see as little as possible of them. But as the secondary stories (the progress of the policemen in the case and another involving the lazy singer Connie Stevens) are quite boring, the director has no choice but to continue imposing those sweaty faces. Very soon, the nervous Darby also begins to sweat, although his scene in the hayloft is done with sensitivity and the climatic moments of Aldrich are stimulating, although disorganized. ** since ****
