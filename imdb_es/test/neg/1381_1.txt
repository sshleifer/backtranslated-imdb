Besides the fact that this guy is a liar, he's also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once, when I tried to see this excuse for a television show, I think I actually vomited a little in my mouth. I can not help feeling a little more foolish every time I see one of his horrible commercials while enjoying the great central comedy shows like Reno 911 and American Body Shop. It shows that I am concerned about the continued existence of humanity. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like a fool. Please start praying now that the central comedy will realize your mistake and you will end this program as soon as possible. Have not we suffered enough?
