The writer and director Emilio Estevez shows a clear lack of talent here with this supposed comedy that can not be exchanged. The script is completely useless, much less the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked. The comedy simply does not work. When Estévez does not use sexual jokes in bad taste, he borrows gags and does them again very badly. You would think that Estévez's team and his brother Charlie Sheen would be great ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The entire cast has no inspiration and is without grace, never managing to laugh, barely provoking a smile from their audience. Do yourself a favor and leave it on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday June 25, 1992 - Video
