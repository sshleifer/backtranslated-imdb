The detonator is located in Bucharest, where an agent of the CIA Government named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down an arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), but things go wrong and Dimitru discovers that Sonni is working for the US government UU . After a great shooting, most of Dimitru's men were killed by Sonni, which the local police force of Romania is unhappy, the main Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni to the United States and at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also being sent back to the United States. However, it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and his soccer club boss Jozef (Tim Dutton) who need her to complete an agreement for a nerve gas bomb that they will try to launch in Washington by killing millions of people ... <br /> <br /> This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong and The Detonator confirms without a doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the club of action movie stars who are relegated to making generic films from action in Eastern European locations, yep Snipes has joined luminaries such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a bit of credit, since it stayed a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004) still fresh in the minds of all moviegoers (all the films he has made since then are they have gone directly to the DVD) but it had to happen sooner or later, like many of the names I mentioned, Snipes has lived the reputation of some of the best movies and if you look at his career, he has been in more bad films than good films. Like the recent films of JCVD ​​and Seagal, The Detonator is pretty horrible. Martin Wheeler's script is as predictable, boring and by numbers as anything else. The detonator is the kind of movie you expect to see on a dark cable television channel that plays at 2 o'clock in the morning. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation in which he has to protect a woman and at first they do not like it, but in the end they are in love, his closest friend in the CIA turns out to be a traitor while the unpleasant one by the head of books that no one really likes turns out to be a pretty decent guy, the Snipes character can run around Bucharest shooting, killing and blowing up people like it does not matter and he's never arrested, the action is Boring and forgettable, the bad guy owns a football club, so there's a lot of annoying soccer terminology and there are not even funny phrases. <br /> <br /> Director Leong does nothing to cheer things up, the trigger looks cheap with a chase in which the two cars never exceed the 30 mph mark. Okay, the action scenes are relatively well prepared, but they are few and far between and completely forgettable in a "bad boy who shoots Snipes", in exchange Snipes shoots a "bad boy" and kills him. There is a half decent shock and explosion, but very little else. It seems that part of The Detonator was shot in a Romanian football stadium, I think I would rather have seen the game for 90 minutes instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 15,000,000 The Detonator is reasonably well done, but not much that really happens. Shot and shot in Bucharest in Romania. The acting is not so good, Snipes does not seem interested and it feels like he's there for the money that I do not blame him for. <br /> <br /> The detonator is another poor cliché action movie starring an actor and set in Eastern Europe. Why is Sony still doing these things? I do not recommend it, there is a much better price of action than there is.
