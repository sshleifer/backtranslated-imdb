'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre movie starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a big problem for a neighbor. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited an excellent apartment on her grandmother's fifth floor, and according to the agreement with the owner, gets a ridiculously low rental rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a spooky weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves out and weird things start to happen, and since it's a B-grade horror movie, there's a reason why it's nonsense that can not be found in reality. While the not very intriguing Jane keeps trying to tell others, her boyfriend, the police, her co-workers, what's happening, everyone thinks she's losing it. So, of course, she has to face the problem: the lunatic life just below her, alone. Neither terrifying nor interesting, the only salvation of the film is Lewis. She is a very good actress but badly used here, which does not mean that she is not the best of this movie, because she is. She has a wild charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that usually populate this type of movie. This type of film, however, is not worthy of it, which is ironic, since it is probably the only reason why someone will see it.
