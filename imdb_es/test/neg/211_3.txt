After seeing this for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. It's a clich√© movie with a stupid configuration. I'm a big fan of thief movies, but it does not offer anything new or special. It is an internal theft that went wrong because "the bad guy with the hot head" shot a bum and, of course, the "bad boy of evil" went on a moral journey. The reason why it is stupid and not credible is. When you've gone so far to kill a vagabond, why do not you kill the only guy who stands between you and 43 million? They had 45 minutes to save the money and organize a robbery. Nobody in their right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr. "do it" and in this case he's a guy they met for a few days ... In general, I leaned into a fast forward from the middle of that, but I eliminated it and sorry
