I'm sorry this movie was a bad thing for the television movie. The rest of you are drugged when you saw him? I thought that hair, makeup and characters were poor in 2 dimensions. The story is doubtful, especially because all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I think that it is not well acted either ... what happened to that hair in the main man of the Turtles? It seemed stuck badly, and the whiskers looked like they were going to fall at any moment. It did not feel like something new was revealed in the band's history and how the members met with other bands and people. I laughed the whole time, Frank Zappa looked stupid, also Mama Cass and the Beatles. They were made to look stupid and ridiculous. Also the other members of the band like Jim Morrison, Donovan, also had a great success apparently stupid. A bit terrible, if that's how you remember these people. It's a bad history lesson about music, it's fictitious the way it was made.
