Oh, yes, this is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable prize of "the worst slasher of the 80s ever made". "The Prey" has everything you normally want to avoid in a horror movie: a derivative and routine plot that you've seen a thousand times (and better), unbearable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of blood and suspense. Blurred photography and unoriginal places and ?? The most irritating of all ?? the most amount of meaningless filler material you have ever encountered (and that is not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). Apart from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic footage, which I will expand later, this film is brazen enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And two occasions where the characters tell silly jokes that are not even remotely funny. The configuration is as rudimentary as possible, with the introduction showing images of a devastating forest fire with human screams of OTT voice-overs. Let's move forward almost forty years later, when an elderly couple that is camping in that same area suffers a blow with the ax for something that breathes strongly off the screen. This should be enough information for you to deduce that someone survived the fire all these years ago and has been hanging around ever since. Enter three intolerable couples in their twenties who head to the danger zone with sex exclusively in their minds, not knowing, of course, that they are sitting on ducks for the stalker and the killer's panting. "The Prey" is a boring and irredeemable film. Apparently, it had already been filmed in 1978, but nobody wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it's not too hard to see why. In case you filter all the content that is really relevant, this would only be a short film with a run time of 30 minutes; possibly even less. There is an unimaginably large amount of images of nature and wildlife, sometimes of animals that I believe do not even live in that type of area, and seem to last forever. In fact, all that is missing is the typical National Geographic narrative that provides educational information about the habits of animals. The animals in their own natural biotope are, without a doubt, pleasing to the eye, but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy slasher movie of the '80s, for shouting out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally worth it, with some powerful killing sequences and fine makeup effects in the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from the "Addams Family" movies), but still stupidity overrides? Is the scene with the vultures too stupid? and the final shot is just laughing out loud, delayed. As mentioned earlier, "The Prey" easily makes my own personal list of the worst slashers of the 80s, along with "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate", "The Stay Awake" and "Curfew".
