I was waiting for this movie for a while. On the first day of the air in Turkey, I saw it. It was totally a disappointment to me. I planned to watch a historical movie, but the one on the screen was fictitious. First of all, the main character of the film Cengiz Han, the great conquest was portrayed as a soft, quiet, even a losing one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine that he created was conquered more (even more) of the world known in those years. To do that, Cengiz first unites the Asian tribes. However, in the movie, this losing man is in a poor scene alone, and in the second scene, he is in command of armies. The scenes of war were incredibly week. In the final battle, the Mongolian rider was using double swords at his sides and cutting off the enemy. :) As a consequence, my friends and I simply laugh at those scenes. Mongolian army means Mongolian archery rider. You can not see that in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to go into the scenes that portrayed Cengiz as a prophet. We can say that in the integrity of the film, it is acceptable. However, the scenes in which the old monk saw the future and went to look for Cengiz Khan's wife after Cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife felt dead and she found the corpse on the continent. We are talking about Asia ?? Again we laugh. There are many more things to say, but I do not think this movie has the courage to talk more.
