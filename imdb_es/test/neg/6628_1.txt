The "Chairman of the Board" of Carrot Top and its AT & T commercials are living proof that flyblown fecal matter is available in the color orange. However, it is not available for FREE, since HBO charges for said garbage. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills suicide hotlines across the country, perhaps providing employment to thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when the treatment of recovered memory was discredited, although (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributes to Fund from your AT & T sponsor in line with the increased telephone traffic of HBO's devastated viewers. I can visualize hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 in the other hand, marking the last-minute desperation before leaving the platform of life to escape the spectrum of the orange-haired monster of COTB echoing in their synapses as the agony of burning and irreversible meningeal inflammation.
