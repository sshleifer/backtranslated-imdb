G & M started a strange couple down at Man About the House and went on to amuse the nation in their own comedy. <br /> <br /> What was the typical small-scale personal charm of couples chemistry on the small screen? The transfer of G & M to the big screen was as frightening as Morcombe and Wise de genuis, and countless excellent television shows. <br /> <br /> Unfunny. Unsatisfactory and with a sick Yootha Joyce who died before the movie was released.
