Do you remember those terrible war movies that your grandmother forced you to see about 25 years ago on your old VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a poorly executed remake of those movies! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It is also terribly slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while I saw him but I could not do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please, do not watch this movie! It's THAT bad! Ten lines is a lot, so I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you will not regret it!
