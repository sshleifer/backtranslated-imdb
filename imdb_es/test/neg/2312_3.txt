As a person who loves movies that appeal to intellectual adventures, as well as those that simply tell stories, this movie should have been appealing. But as written and directed by Catherine Breillat, who seems to be developing her own enigmas in cinematic experiences, this tedious and talented film does not arouse interest. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is The Screen of Breillat, a director frustrated in her attempts to film a scene of convincing sex with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is The Actor and Roxane Mesquida is The Actress ). The only "funny" thing is that Jeanne is imposing the use of a dildo tied to the Actor so that she brings the sex scene to fruition, but even this gap is quickly exhausted and we are left with a movie inside a movie that feels more like a piece of 'deleted scenes' on a DVD than a classy French comedy.
