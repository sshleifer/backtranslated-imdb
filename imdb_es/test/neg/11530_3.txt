Bad shot, poorly edited, awkward dialogue, flat characters, failed adaptation of a novel. It really can not be much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me during this hour and a half, more like three hours of boredom. Occasionally, good comments of a line. <br /> <br /> David is a silly young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a giant video of Chinese philosophy, although that does not seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a gang of debt collectors, where each member has an IQ below sea level. A missing script, along with non-creative shooting and an even worse edit, makes what might have been pretty funny incidents of a failure in debt collection resemble an amateur home reality show. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment from a Haraldur elementary school, teacher, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A script with a severe lack does not offer David anything to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes that show Haraldur doing something David might have misinterpreted would have done the job. The possibilities of the cinema as a means of communication, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, are not exploited. <br /> <br /> At first, David's connection with Haraldur elevates his status within the gang of debt collectors. but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is fine, but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better movie. A good scriptwriter could have made some of this material. Unfortunately, that is not the case. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson does not have much to work with, but he does the best he can with the little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) are handled well. <br /> <br /> General opinion: what could have been a fun and entertaining movie about a scary antihero in a gang of debt collectors, becomes a boring, poorly made movie made after a poor manuscript. Looking at the toes for an hour and a half would be more pleasant.
