A group of 7 gold diggers goes to a mine that was recently opened after an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget horror movie ($ 25,000) has a small cult following and I'm not exactly sure why (unless it's because it's so dark). I admit that the last half hour is quite entertaining, but the time to get there is pure torture. A lot of walking and talking and our titular strangeness does not appear until 45 minutes. Even in the extras, co-writer Chris Huntley admits he commits the unforgivable sin of being bored. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC, so I hope they know that an exploitation film should be exploitative. Anyway, as I said, the last half hour is great, since three survivors fight against the stop motion monster and there is a good score like John Carpenter's. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even if the movie is not the best, the DVD Code Red has paid close attention. He has interviews and an audio commentary from director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-writer Huntley. The stories about how the film was made are quite fascinating and inspiring (like a set of caves that is being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are the student shorts of Sawicki and Huntley at the USC, which are actually all better than feature film production. Huntley was a very talented artist and it is a pity that he has not continued with anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera player. The VHS of the film is legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure it's much better. However, you still get scenes in which the only image is five helmet lights bouncing in the dark. It's safe to say that the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still the "horror movie in a mine" champion.
