This is what happens when a franchise becomes lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were played as horror films, with genuine fears (although predictable) that remained true to the theme of the film. Then they ran out of people for the doll to stalk, and they decided to play to laugh, with the following two black comedies ... <br /> <br /> Well, that's what happened here, but I think it was not meant to be like that. It's like saying: "I WANTED to make pancakes for dessert! I did it on purpose!" when your souffle accidentally turns off. But the milk spilled, and it had some value in the theaters as nonsense. <br /> <br /> When the floor fell away from under the passengers' seats, I expected the passengers to extend their legs through the hole. , begins to run Flintstones-Style, to safely land the plane in the Alps. I do. I would have fit into the stupid topic of the rest of the program. <br /> <br /> Instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the film, what about the social possibilities? Do you like George Kennedy's character to react calmly to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, a man would not easily accept the idea that he just spilled his heart to a paid companion. It is assumed that he felt he made a connection with a related spirit, which is later shown to be a mercenary sex worker with a line of arrival. Who would not feel cheated by the experience? And yet, he laughs, and wraps his arms around his friend's waist as they walk away cheerfully. What is a cheap summary of a scene of poor quality. Auch. <br /> <br /> I had a souffle appetite, and they served me some tasteless cliche pancakes. And no, you did not do it on purpose!
