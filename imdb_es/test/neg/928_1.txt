A horrible, horrible, horrible movie. I saw the original when I was a child and it gave me nightmares in my adolescence. When I discovered there was a new version on the way, I moaned. WHY OH WHY does a good movie remake? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for disturbing another classic horror movie. This time, they have replaced a rather interesting story with gore, slower than slow rhythm, and characters inspired by yawning. Someone previously said that he was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Uh, were you watching the movie? She plays a little prissy bum. It sounds like a box for me. Half of the people in the audience actually complained when she died! That tells you why people are watching this movie. If that is your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole, this thing will suck you more lives than you would like. If I had been alone, I would have left 10 minutes in the boring exhibition. This is like a guide to imbeciles to make fucking movies: in southern git servants, great but attractive drivers, many knives, gore, a truck full of actions, I could go on. After watching this movie, I started to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought the movie was crap. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.
