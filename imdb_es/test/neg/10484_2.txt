When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small town in Texas, people begin to die. The county sheriff tries to investigate, but other government officials obstruct it. It turns out that there is a gorilla from the mutant space in the walk killing teenagers in the forest. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget horror and science fiction movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance that I liked this movie. Unfortunately, I did not do it. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the bad acting, the cheesy dialogue, the atrocious musical music or the gigantic holes in the plot that this film has. There are many movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed in such a bad way that it is good. <br /> <br /> But where others of that type and Night Fright differ, is that Night Fright only has a terrible rhythm. And it goes on because of that. There are scenes that go on and on without anything happening: the search for clues in the forest is only people who walk in the forest for a long time; At a party in the forest there are several seemingly endless dancers ... but nothing interesting happens. If these scenes were shorter, the film might not have been so boring (although I do not think that just cutting those scenes would save this). <br /> <br /> Now I have given you three views of this movie to make sure I gave it a shot before hitting it in this review. Unfortunately, it has gotten worse with each watch. There will not be a room.
