There is a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. Taking into account that it was made in 1953, this is a very brave film about transvestites, which deals with the problem with a lot of seriousness and sympathy (and offers the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and tries not to stereotype. The film clearly states that transvestites are not homosexual, and that, apart from wearing women's clothes, they lead a relatively normal life. It has to do with the pain of not being accepted in society: the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) who desperately tries to understand the problem due to the recent suicide of a transvestite. Therefore, he must give everyone involved in this film the merit for having taken such a controversial subject (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I also regret to say that this movie is absolutely terrible. In trying to portray the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), the film turns into silly fantasies (and, sometimes, surprisingly, given the time, sensual) that make history very difficult to follow. The performance is made of wood at best. None of the dialogues is real; the actors look and sound like people who read speeches written by others. And, worst of all, there was no point in having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles that this poor man assumed in the later stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," the character of poor Lugosi (called The Spirit in the credits, but actually is more like a mad scientist) continued to cry. And nothing he did really seemed to have much connection to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> For artistic merit, the film really does not deserve much more than 1/10. However, for the courage that comes with just putting it, I will give it a 3/10.
