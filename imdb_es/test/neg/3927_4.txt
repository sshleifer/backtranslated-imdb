Preface saying that I am a big fan of JJL and NOT of Patrick. Therefore, I saw this to see his performance and, of course, it was excellent. I do not think the director was suitable for the film, since several very bad decisions were made: shooting angles, blocking, etc. If the director tried to give it a "realistic" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of that. I almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from the intense facial reactions, and many times when the action depended on the intimacy of the main characters, the dialogue was slow and arduous. This could easily have been solved by cuts or camera angle changes. But the impression I had was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! It also gave me the impression that perhaps the scenes were recorded several times and the energy coming from the actors ... was exhausted.
