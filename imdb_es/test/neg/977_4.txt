I left this vehicle of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and of Murphy in particular the first time, but seeing it again, recently, I can see that it has some very funny fragments. <br /> <br /> This is by no means to say that this is the best comedy of friends of all time, but in reality, what can you do with the subgenre already exhausted? What the director, Tom Dey, has tried to do is turn it into a satire of the clichés of the comedy of friends and the media. At the beginning of the film, the executive of a cable network asks: "How is this different from Cops?", When Chase Renzi is launching the idea of ​​a reality show related to the character of De Niro, Mitch Preston (for true, a boring name). It was then that I saw him in a new light that I had not previously noticed. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the friends comedy and give them a spin. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and partnering with Murphy is out of all the police movies you can imagine. You can say that De Niro is playing himself asking, "Why would I make another movie playing a cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood fake, but if you look at her opening scene again, she's just doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing, but wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all: "Who does not want to be on TV?" Maybe this is reading too much in what is essentially a light movie, just to entertain, but it gives you a little twist you had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You have to applaud him for looking ridiculous. Trey wants to be such a bad star that he is willing to sell everything that comes in contact with him. Murphy was a great star and maybe he was moved because everything is so fleeting. <br /> <br /> The plot with the gun is, of course, quite boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end, which required a lot of effort from both the cast and the team. One thing I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80s pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds up to the entire media spin. <br /> <br /> Then, I destroyed it the first time, but what the hell; If you are going to do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy had a great opportunity to do this?
