When I saw the poster in the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast that is worth trying. But, after entering, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many logical flaws and no sense. For me, it's a movie that is not worth putting in theaters. It's not even worth seeing.
