A look at the rating should tell you that this movie was voted on by Shills, in an attempt to artificially improve the ratings of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie does not bring anything new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and cinematography) and derived in its plot. The makeup looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when they are shot. The lines are rigidly delivered and badly programmed, with the exception of the bounty hunter, who is the only good actress in this movie mess. The worst offenders are the Italian boy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist and the main bad boy. I have seen a better delivery of a pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> This is a self-proclaimed "zombie western", but the only thing that makes this a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the real name of the main actor is Clint. The protagonist is not great and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an antihero, he does not have the sensible attitude to do it either. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. by false comments that glow. This is just another B-grade zombie movie that is done competently for the budget it had (it has decent lighting), but it stinks at low budget, first-time direction and bad acting. There are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateur.
