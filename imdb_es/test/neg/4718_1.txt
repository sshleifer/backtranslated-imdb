In this horrible attempt to imitate Blair Witch, a group of people goes to Africa to investigate a creature called Half Caste. It is quite obvious that there was not a script to talk about, and that everything was improvised. That can work if you have good actors, what this movie did not do. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to earn points for originality by exploring a darker myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the forest where the characters do "extravagant African things" like eating elephant dung. There are also some pretty good images of the lions that eat (from the National Geographic perspective) but there is not a single scare in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust or Blair Witch Project, this movie will not surprise you, and you can probably see better lions videos on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely a half-aste effort. <br /> <br /> A note for the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time keep the home movie "How I spent my African holidays" for your family and close friends. Nobody else wants to see it.
