He was only cautiously enthusiastic when renting "All children love Mandy Lane", as I instantly remembered hearing and reading a wide variety of opinions. both positive and negative? in the short period of time between his brief cinematic release and the distribution to the video game shelves. Supposedly, this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror movie in years, with non-stereotyped teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change. Granted, the basic concept may seem reasonably innovative, but inevitably the script quickly returns to the same old and irritating clich√©s, and once that point is over, even the ingenious stylistic marks can not save the film from the terrible mediocrity.

Director Jonathan Levine opted for the classic Bobby Vinton song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play during the trailer and the final credits, while initially he was convinced that the film would inevitably present Barry Manilow's corny love song, "Mandy "
