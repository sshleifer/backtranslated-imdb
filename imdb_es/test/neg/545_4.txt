The basic idea of ​​the ENCHANTED APRIL story is excellent: two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To cover the costs even more, they get two more strangers to come. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation, in particular, that show how this beautiful environment really changes your perspectives in life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally ruined by two key performances in the cast that are so bad that they spoil the movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her look ridiculous. His expression of "bulging eyes" and his empty eyes really make you wonder if this is not a zombie movie or if it's just an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so disgusting and grandiloquent that he was very close to shutting down the movie: it was so horrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one critic gave this film a 10, which is very, very difficult to understand. Sure, the movie has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two dazzling performances can not be ignored as they undermine the rest of the image. I'm sorry, but this movie was looking forward to doing it again!
