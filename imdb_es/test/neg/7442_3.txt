Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave them alone, or are willing to recycle to the point that every piece of trash that Hollywood generates is ready to be delivered to Alpo. It seems that every science fiction action movie must endure a sad list of follow-up movies, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under the direction of Paul Verhoven, was a wild and elegant journey, even finding time for a small social commentary on what the dark side of biotechnology is capable of turning us into. This movie does not have any of that, other than telling us that the drugs are bad for you and could make you do things that you would regret when you are sober. Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the deeply frightening vision of what we are becoming, and instead takes us awkwardly on a boat trip to the way the drug traffickers and their victims really are. Damn the social comment. This really bit me the big one. If you do not care about anything more than the SFX, go to him, my friend. Otherwise, do not waste time with this bittersweet cake without yeast, and keep the heavy weight, accurately measured and heavy weight, out of the oven. It's that easy.
