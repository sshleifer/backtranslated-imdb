Comedy is a difficult beast to conquer. Ishimoto fails in all accounts, as writer and director. Some things, like making movies that are fun, should only be left to professionals. 1 of 10. Horrible. It was not funny I tried to laugh but it was not funny. I was not the only one, nobody else at the Chicago festival was laughing, at least for the performance I saw. Just very bad, I'm sorry :(
