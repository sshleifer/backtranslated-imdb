Mansfield Park, in its second half, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price is my favorite of its heroines, so I am saddened by the unhappy fate it has suffered in its large and small screen performances. The only good reading of the character that I heard was made on the radio by Amanda Root, who gave her the same quality as Anne in the "Persuasion" movie: a severe, safe and sincere moral center. If the actress had been younger, it would also have been a good visual casting; but the Fannys that have come to our eyes to date are more similar, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the girl from the boilers; and (in this incarnation) a girl of jovial, or possibly acid, service with her high moral principles broke down a stake. <br /> <br /> Well, I had expected something better, but I had feared something worse. The series had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was the best in nice shots, and the perfect, that is, perfectly abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was boring. The film, which was apparently thought of as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out as a burlesque mix. After such disappointments, and the most recent disappointments of the sister pieces of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Abbey of Northanger"), I could not help it, but I have mixed expectations for this; and, in general, it made me feel like I was a little bit better at doing it. He condensed the novel intelligently, and in the end he left me with the same feeling, as a comic book version would do. On the other hand, to do so, he had to rework most of the characters, except the Crawfords, and incidentally decreased or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including his most famous character and what it should be, if It is not, its most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is the officiating Aunt Norris, always ready to lead other people in what to do, but always manages to avoid having to do anything by herself; Here one does not have any sense of that at all. And with it goes much more: his comment that goes through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years, and her apologies for it; Fanny's honesty in recognizing, during a home visit, that Aunt Norris, for all her faults, could manage the house better than any of her sisters. But then, the whole trip is missing in the story, and so is most of what happens in the theatrical rehearsals and most of what bothers Sir Thomas upon his return; and in fact, Sir Thomas himself, and his wife, are different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny, one of the most complex of Austen, is simplified to the naked eye; Fanny lacks the firm defense of what she knows is right, and what she knows is very likely, against all the distractions that Crawford and anyone else can throw at her. For a male reader, now no less than when it was written, reveals with incomparable clarity, at least unmatched, as far as I know, what a woman goes through to try to deal fairly but firmly with a man with whom she has reasons to distrust. It's a brilliant scene, in the novel; on television it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And, Fanny, oh, Fanny: when will we see your taste?
