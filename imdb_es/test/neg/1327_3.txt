One might think that with the incredible backdrop of the Second World War in Stalingrad, writers will write a script. No, there is NO history here! It's like pornography, vignettes of violence interrupted by a pathetic, memory and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A group of Germans march around the firing and shooting. Little by little there are fewer Germans to march, shoot and be shot. Then there are no Germans to march, shoot and be shot. <br /> <br /> Very badly. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
