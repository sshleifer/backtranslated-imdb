... when this movie was on. <br /> <br /> How boring. An attempt at humor, but in reality it is not achieving too well. Some good ideas were released, and the makeup and costumes of the actors were fine. <br /> <br /> I expected much more, unfortunately I could not see more, I disabled half of the video and I ejected the tape, I went to the rental store to recover my money ...
