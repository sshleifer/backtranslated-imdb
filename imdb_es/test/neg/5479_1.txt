This could have been the best game of all! But the creators of games simply made a mistake after 3 murders and the end !! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hit-man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered as one of the best games ever created. <br /> <br /> You combine the four and you get this game !! It has all the positive aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, stealth assassinations, open world and HISTORY! For the first 3 murders you feel that this game is the best! But after the third, things seem to be so repetitive, that you just wait for the GAME to end. <br /> <br /> I've played this on a PC and the PC version is horrible with faults and the stupid side quests do not make sense. <br /> <br /> MY advice for everyone. This is a good game, but do it either for XBOX360 or PS3. DO NOT get it for PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game comes from the creators of Prince Of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and is NOT better than the four games mentioned above!
