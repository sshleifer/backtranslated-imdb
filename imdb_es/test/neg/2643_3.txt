If it were not for the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role, I would have turned off "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. However, despite how easy it is for her, it is not enough to save this movie, far from it. <br /> <br /> Milo begins with a group of young girls who accompany a "supposed young boy" in a yellow polisher to a house in the forest where he shows embryos in jars. Apparently, the deal was that if he showed them the jars, old Milo has to do a gynecological exam to each one in return. One of the group volunteers to be Milo's "first patient" and he carries it behind closed doors. Moments later, blood flows from under the door and leads us to the present. Enter the lovely Jostyn who plays one of the girls who grew up today. A substitute teacher with little confidence whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish, receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. Yes! You guessed it. Return to Miloville. Milo, who supposedly drowned years ago, seems to be having a dilemma for remaining dead and begins to terrorize and murder the girls he did not "examine" so many years ago. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants in "The Brood" by Cronenberg. I could have been scared, but what fear can a villain wearing a yellow raincoat have? The plot is confused even to itself and the conclusion left me wanting to recover my 90 minutes. I'm sending Milo, an inept slasher movie, to stand in the corner!
