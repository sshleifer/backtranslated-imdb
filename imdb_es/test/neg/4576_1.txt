I went to see "Passion of Mind" because I usually like the romance genre of alternative reality, that is, "Sliding doors", "Me, myself, myself", etc. <br /> <br /> But this was the worst I've seen! I had to force myself to sit through that. I did not even keep the credits that have not been heard. <br /> <br /> The magical realism was completely lost because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she had two times were men who usually play at being villains although each of them was sexy and attractive. <br /> <br /> Actually, a psychological explanation for the dual lives was provided, with an unpleasant chill from The Elektra Complex; Maybe magic should not be explained to make this genre work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 05/28/2000)
