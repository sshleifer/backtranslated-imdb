I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I expected to enjoy a movie that I hoped would be different from the book. There were considerable differences with respect to the book, as well as the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and I got to enjoy the movie, despite the changes in the book. It was still nice, it was full of action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the film, the symbols meet and resolve quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow beyond the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we did not have a chance to look at them and appreciate how they work. The final symbol of the Illuminati, which was the most interesting and creative of the book, was replaced by the symbol of the crossed keys. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to concentrate and devote a little more time to the symbols, which is what Langdon's character is about. In general, this movie is a very bad interpretation of the book, and fails in the attempt to be an action / thriller movie. 4 out of 10
