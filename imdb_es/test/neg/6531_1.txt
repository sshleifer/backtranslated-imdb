I came out of this movie and I did it only once before with the Australian movie Sweetie almost 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt like killing the cameraman and I could not believe that this movie actually showed up anywhere and, guess what, was nominated for two independent Spirit Spirit awards. What???? Regardless of how realistic the dialogue can be (I will NEVER use the word "friend" again!) Who wants to hear these conversations? I do not go to the cinema to bother me, but that's all I have. The only good thing that I achieved was the realization that if this film can reach Sundance and other festivals, anyone can do it. Well, wait, that might not be a good thing after all ...
