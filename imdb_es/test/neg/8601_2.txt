Sometimes, when a film is criticized by critics, you have to see it to see if it's really as bad as the claim, well, in this case it was. I think it was meant to be a sex comedy, but it was neither sexy nor funny, I think I once chuckled when Johnny Vegas did not jump one near the road and that was it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the lives of the four men who give out potatoes to make a living, each of them has a problem with their sex life; Dave left his wife and looks for an old flame that once invited him to a trio a few years before. Ferris lives with his mother-in-law, who treats him as a sexual object. Tolly has an obsession with involving strawberry jam in their encounters. and Jeremy says he is in a loving relationship, but in fact he is harassing a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the jokes varies from insipid to "I do not think anyone can write that" an example of the latter is when they tell a young child that his father died in a car accident, and then for the punch line when the child asks how his mother is, they tell him he is in a coma. The blame for all this is due directly to the writers' feet, the actors obviously made a bad decision by agreeing to be in this movie, but I did not think their acting was so bad ... not that it was so good either. . Surprisingly, for a pretty sordid movie about sex there are no nudity and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> Of course, I would not recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity, although judging by other criticisms, this seems to be a love or a hate film, I suspect it would be better to see it later of a few beers and with his companions.
