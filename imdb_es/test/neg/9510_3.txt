Franco Zeffirelli's third attempt at "The Taming Of The Shrew", "Romeo and Juliet", "Jesus Of Nazareth", "Othello", to transfer Shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson (" Mad Max, "" Lethal weapon "and notoriety of" The Passion of Christ "in the paper that once belonged to Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly so, see my criticism in his" Hamlet ", possibly the best interpretation of one of the timeless of Bard (and the most cited) tragedies) and remade 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a thoroughbred treatment, explaining his execution time of 3 hours and 22 minutes, combined with a cast of dreams (and a lot of small additions , which were well chosen and done by the contemporary teacher of William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, the director of "Henry V" and "Dead Again." Along with the star of "Lethal Weapon" are Glenn Close ("The Big Chill") , Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons", Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Malone and (who would be chosen as Roderigo along with Kenneth Branag and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "dramatic" version of the tragedy, though he only acted in it) and whom Branagh would interpret as Laertes in HIS 3-hour version of "Hamlet" (a fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; see my review on that too (5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be chosen as Cassio in his brother's version of "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who would be chosen in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein "4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli proposed this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years before this movie) and it works quite well, for the most part. With what I felt a bit uncomfortable was that Zeffirelli lost many lines and, in one scene, he delivers one of Hamlet's lines to the Phantom. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter did NOT convince me like Ophelia. She was too boring and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's epic and revised retouch of "Hamlet") were good at role, with Jean Simmons is the BEST Ofelia of all time, that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in 1948 (she did not win, what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too fast, not as slowly as he expected, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But, again, I'm more used to the interpretations of Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers on paper and I think they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both made by great directors, actors, text editors, producers And protagonists of all his versions of Bard's work) like Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene in which Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh increased the scene at greater distances to create even more emotional intensity and suspense than the scene required. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branagh's version and finally this version). Despite the "PG" rating of the movie, there was actually nothing objectionable in the movie. Only what the work requires. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can not decide which was the best. See my comments in these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It started well with a scene that was not in the play, but it should have progressed to the actual beginning of the play, where a guard shouts "Who's there?" "No, answer me, stand up and roll up!" That scene scares you very much because you're sitting in silence and then, bam! You almost jump out of your skin. In short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the work. Huge mistake on the part of Zeffirelli to omit that scene. He also lost many lines (and others that I think should have been placed), like the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia "Take a convent of nuns, why would you be a breeder of sinners?"; it was assumed that that line had occurred in THAT scene, NOT where it was placed in the film (after the soliloquy "To be or not to be." This version has difficulty eliminating too much or too little of an excellent literary work.) Kenneth Branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making his version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier, as several of the actors (apart from him) performed "Hamlet" on stage / or in the However, Zeffirelli's version of "Hamlet" is faithful to the work and that is what he was looking for.The configuration for the duel of the final act was the same as in the versions of Olivier and Branagh, only that the outcome in Branagh's version it was more violent than the outcome of the two previous faithful versions (more in line with the work, Olivier attenuated it ... and it worked just as well) and stayed closer to the work, with Branagh launching some You touch us harmless of your own ... very good effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not classified.
