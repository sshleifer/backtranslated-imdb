I starred Eugene Morris Jerome in my adaptation of the play's high school and this film is definitely not up to the screenplay or the imagination of Neil Simon. I know this game backwards and forwards and I can honestly tell you that the performance was incorrect, the production was corny. The changes in the script of the work were badly made. If you really want to enjoy this work, you should see the actual reproduction, not an adaptation of a Hollywood movie. Eugene's character lacked soul and was too sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were also out of tune. A general disappointment, disorderly, disloyal to the work, executed by amateurs.
