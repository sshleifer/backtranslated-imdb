Â¿Where to start? I think that only three other films have led me to publish a review in IMDb, and all were positive. In terms of this ...? <br /> <br /> Awesome, frighteningly, tragically, shamefully, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and absolutely beyond the horrible. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this has been done, it does not matter given a theatrical premiere. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I'm not a "snob". I did not expect a beautiful movie or an intense depth of the characters, but this is really a joke. We simply MUST demand more of the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the Black Death.
