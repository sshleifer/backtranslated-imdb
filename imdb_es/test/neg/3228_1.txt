This is beyond stupidity. <br /> <br /> Two graduates of high school travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations that are absolutely disgusting. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore co-stars in this one. Since the movie was in 1986, was Ashton Kutcher just a baby in the woods at that time? <br /> <br /> Moore's grandfather died and his home is about to be sold to ruthless people with a father and son Bobcat Goldthwait, with that nasty voice in the movie, as well as two brothers, who make the fools look smarter and smarter. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely ridiculous. The highlight of stupidity is when one person says to the other: "Did you ever notice that when people die, they appear alphabetically in the newspapers?" <br /> <br /> I rest my case.
