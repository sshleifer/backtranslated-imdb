I lost 5 dollars renting this complete piece of garbage. Dr. Zack is the most unpleasant main character I've seen. The movie was full of EVERY cliché you could think of and it did not contain a single UNIT of originality. There was the typical sexism represented by robust foreigners, all the boys had those attitudes "too proud to take advice" that are as old as Grandma's Christmas cake. The concept and the deaths were really great, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end) However, nothing is really revealed, the end is the greatest escape I have ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. Dialogue is missing, and that is an understatement to a large extent. There are mostly random shouts, pensive looks and thick sentences. The actors are simply GODDESS! I do not want to talk about this movie anymore, it's annoying me. I'm just wondering if the director saw it when it was made. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a bunch of ants that "evolved", so now they need bones to move, (no matter the fact that this does not serve for any evolutionary advantage, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, although the movie acts as if they killed out of necessity.) This movie made me more foolish). the idiot leader who kills the mother ant (a big stain) that destroys all the other ants. Nice cliché huh? It almost cracks at the end due to a sudden emotional attachment to the mother's thing that overcomes it. Give me a break.
