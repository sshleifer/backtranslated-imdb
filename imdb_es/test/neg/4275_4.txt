Okay, I have not read the book yet, but I must say that the main character was a mistake. How can I say that such a thing I have not read the book you ask? It's simple. As a spectator of this miniseries, I got irritated by the gestures, the gestures and the appearance of the main character, Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but quite another to be a stick in the clay creature who disdains to see someone in the face or meet their eyes. In addition to the exaggerated profile of "Susan B. Anthony," she seemed determined to refuse to look at another person. The scene in which Edmond is pouring his heart towards her, she looks forward all the time, which forces him to do the same. As a result, it was simply uncomfortable and I could not understand anyone who is in love with her, let alone Henry and Edmond. Many have said that I was faithful to the book, if that is the case, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create a character as her main heroine. It is possible to create a character that has been used by others and managed to gain their trust and affection, but the representation of this character in this miniseries simply did not do it for me.
