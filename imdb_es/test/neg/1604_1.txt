Very boring show. What's worse, it's very racist. White men are idiots and the only romance is between a black man and a white woman. There's nothing interesting in this romance, it's not exciting, it's not fun, it does not even seem to worry about each other, it's more like the writers and directors want something interracial. Why is this so popular in the media today? It is a social programming and will not lead to anything good, there is always tension when too many people want the same. This show is not worth the 20 dollars of the season, it is a waste of time and is harmful to society. At least when they use television programs to sell products, they are more discreet, selling any agenda here is quite obvious, and without thinking clearly some may feel bad when opposing, but some of us know better.
