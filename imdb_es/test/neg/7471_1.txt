"Grande Ecole" is not an artistic exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you need it, a film for a channel with X classification. Although I suspect that in this film there is nothing that can be ruined for a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Parisian school for future executive directors and an important school for those seeking superior degrees in the liberal arts. Likewise, there is a chill of cultural shock among high-status, lower-status French youth, as well as a social conflict involving native French and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a woman-woman coupling, which could have been easily fixed with only a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The performance is on a somewhat higher level than in usual pornography. Film - but "Grande Ecole" is, to be frank, is nothing but pornography with artistic aspirations. I'm not offended by sex. It's just repetitive and, in a short time, boring. Where is Hays's office when you really need it?
