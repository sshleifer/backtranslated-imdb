Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is not better than mediocre and that is being generous. The story line is grafted into a travel notebook and remains uninvolved. <br /> <br /> Located in (say) a suburb of Newark, the plot would be considered ridiculous. All that saves the film is the Tuscan countryside and some occasional scenes in Florence and Positano, and a film of the variety "while the sun sinks slowly in the west" would have served in a better way to show what is undoubtedly Los most charming places around the world.
