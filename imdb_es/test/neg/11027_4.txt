Carole Lombard and James Stewart try to inject some life and meaning into this strange construction film about the tribulations of a newly married couple. The scenes are reproduced as if they were divided among several directors, each with a different objective. Some are capra-cute, others inflated, others melodramatic and others surprisingly noir. There is even an extended sequence of adventures, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane that flies through a blizzard. It is difficult to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole has such an erratic tone and the story is not credible. It's just worth seeing for the film students or the fanatics of the actors; Some smaller parts, like Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well interpreted.
