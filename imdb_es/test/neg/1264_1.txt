It is possible that the spectators of the Czech film have enjoyed and qualified this film for being Czech, but it seemed hackneyed, tedious, moronic, boring and insipid. Once again, I suspect "ramps" to increase sales of this dog from a movie. Amazon describes this film as about a couple of colleagues who refuse to grow, but I will go one further. I think it's about two guys who have gone into a state of dementia and perform actions that do not make sense to anyone. I was told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the movie, and I would believe it. When he saw his performance, he probably realized the horrible job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid the terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which I'm sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he. He had done it in "Autumn Spring". Do not waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It is nothing more than a dog in a manger.
