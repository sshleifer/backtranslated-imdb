The childish, frantic, somewhat petty humor abounds in this city boy turned into the aspiring farmer. It's not outrageous enough to attract the Will Ferrell crowd, and it's not interesting enough to carry the length of the show. The most that I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that, for the most part, it avoids the humor of the toilet. The main problem is that all the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a very unpleasant hero. There are some funny snippets that involve farm animals, and that's it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable that it makes "Jury Duty" look like "Gone with the Wind." - MERK
