Without knowing it, I entered this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could return the time or just get a refund, I would feel happy. <br /> <br /> It was 7:30 pm and Cinderella Man did not start until 10 pm, so I ran to the theater to see the movie that started at 7:20 pm ... and I dare say that God extended his hand (or withdrew it) and allowed me to punish myself for my movie The Gluttony for sitting in this movie. <br /> <br /> It may be unfair to criticize a film that was not directed to my cohort of straight men, however, there is no excuse for poor sound quality and video editing. This movie was worthy of a budget for a high school project ... and I think I've seen better in those French acting shorts we used to do about Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this movie was for the Los Angeles candy packaging team and their ladies supporters. Woe to me when I realized that the whole audience saved me from all the jokes and understandings ... I understood perfectly the suggestive humor ... but I could not relate! <br /> <br /> This show does show me, supposedly, how gay men go out and build relationships. However, even if it was his purpose for the film, I feel that "homosexuality" was too focused on ... humanity seemed to be missing ... but once again, maybe that was the point ... just being avant- gard ... and to make a touch. <br /> <br /> I suppose that with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your movie as "high" as possible to get crowds and cash back. I really wish I had read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was totally the wrong audience.
