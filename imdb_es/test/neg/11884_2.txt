My wife and I could not even finish the movie. In truth, it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical accuracy is not compromised by the events themselves or by the ridiculous unidimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. In fact, he is represented as if he were a great humanist and believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, the camp! My lord, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the soap opera that my mother saw when I was a child and had a better dialogue than this one. Constant exposure and pontificating grids over the ears like nails on the blackboard. Ugh (Okay, I exaggerate a bit, but the dialogue is really bad). The HBO Rome series is superior for the sole reason that its characters were at least credible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was also wise enough to know that they could not organize epic battle scenes. The creators of this movie did not do it. When CÃ©sar attacks Munda, the scene of the battle is practically ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will grant that the costumes are perfectly good. The sets are fine, although their CGI backgrounds can be a bit shocking at times. Although the sound is bad, both in terms of music and foley and the dubbing of many of the secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not worth renting it. As a history student, I expected an alternative approach to Augustus than HBO in Rome, which, I believe, failed to capture their general "feel" as well as they did with Cesar or Antonio. Instead, I should have limited myself to my reading.
