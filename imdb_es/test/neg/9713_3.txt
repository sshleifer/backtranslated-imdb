Pete's meteorite I have seen this referred to as "authentic" and a "jewel". I picked up this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish he had not. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was noted as the first dramatic role of Mike Myers. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you will notice is that Pete's Meteor suffers from a complete lack of plot. Or, rather, a lot of small subplots that are not really connected and do not go anywhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and his sister with his grandmother. A meteorite lands in its garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the film, Mickey is the one who claims the meteor, and the "plot" actually has little to do with the meteor in any form or form. From here on, several other characters and subplots are introduced. But as I said before, they really do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Things go from a nice family movie to a dark thriller pretty fast, when he introduces himself to Pete (Mike Myers) and starts playing a role. Micky blames him for the death of his parents, although in reality they never tell us what happened or why. Hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can not overcome his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug-related past begins to catch up with him and he temporarily attracts his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast to the mix when the shadow characters begin to try to kill him. This seems to be the main plot, until you realize that you do not have a role until the middle of the movie, making everything else feel like a useless filler. The problems of Hugh's girl, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what the hell have to do with this? Not much. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the 'plot' is disjointed and half of it does not make sense. But a good cast of characters can save it, right? Keyword: good. Most of the characters are terribly unpleasant people, most of whom you would like to see die horribly. At least, I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see it in action. It is one of the WORST small children I have seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. He 'borrows' a car, harasses and talks trash to Hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually tries to set the man's house on fire when he does not get his way, and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. One would think that such a boy is on his way to jail. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never receives what is close to him. I'm not sure at what point you're supposed to sympathize with your character, because he's always an unpleasant brat. He is the leader of his brother and sister, so, as expected, they end up taking a back seat and just follow what he does. Surprisingly, they are so far away that I can not even remember their names. They may not even be there. <br /> <br /> Your grandmother is almost an alcoholic limit. He tends to be as disgusting to Hugh as Mickey, and he likes to get people out of his house and throw evil looks at them when he's not drinking bottles of liquor and drinking nonsense. Quite ridiculous when you consider that you are supposed to take care of three children. His problems with alcohol are never really addressed, although he collapses from time to time in the movie. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few nice characters in the movie, but that's just because he is the punching bag for most of the characters and they take their mess without returning it. The children treat him badly but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do good things with them. He has a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take all aspects of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, trying to leave him several times in the movie when he gets into his cosmic jargon or does something to prove that he is not. exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (fortunately). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite having the only solid purpose and plot of the film, is extremely underused and does not play any role until the second half. It's unfortunate that Myers has stayed in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete gets screen time, half is just Myers running through dark alleyways and hiding in small corners. And even though it was the only real point of this film, when its plot ends with the film, it is a strange and unsatisfactory conclusion that makes all the characters laugh with a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie, which makes you wonder if they only performed in the movie you were watching. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's meteor is the role of Mike Myers as Pete, and that is if you can get through this messy mess long enough without lashing out at another human being because of the extremely unpleasant characters and the nonexistent plot line. No sir, I did not like this at all.
