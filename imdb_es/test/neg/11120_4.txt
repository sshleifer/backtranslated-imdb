Apparently in early 2005, SciFi Channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of John Rhys-Davies and said: "We need you to star in another SciFi original." What is scary is that, in reality, it is quite good in this movie. That is really saying something, since this is a silly feature of SciFi creature; You have to put some feeling to be well acted. Unfortunately, nobody else does. It is his stereotypical movie "moster-run-amok" on a cruise. The cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy SEALs think they have everything under control, but they do not know what they are dealing with and they all end up dead, a girl jumps to the role of "sexpot" like Rhys- Davies' daughter and the creature kills about 100 companions. What this film has in its favor is that it is VERY quick and animated; You're never bored or waiting for another kill. However, apart from that, he does not do anything to distinguish himself, and it is foolish that this thing is dragged through all the roofs and can not be hurt by the Navy SEAL machine guns, but the daughter of Rhys-Davies can kick her with karate. . Kinda went from one side to another in giving this bad boy a 5, but for the previous stupidity I give him a 4.
