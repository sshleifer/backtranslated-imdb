I was hoping that "Born to Kill" was an exciting black high-tension cinema. Instead, it has two good pieces of action (one at the beginning and one at the end) and a wonderfully atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of La movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychological kick, but it is a strictly numeric performance, mechanically producing what the public expected of him after "Dillinger" (an overrated movie but at least better than this). The character of Claire Trevor is too stupid and unmotivated to attract any audience, and the action (as it is) remains so decidedly within that damn house in San Francisco that the film becomes claustrophobic instead of truly exciting. It is one of those movies in which the secondary players, in particular Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose homoerotic itching of the character for Tierney is one of the few subtleties in a fairly obvious script) and Isabel Jewell - outperform the protagonists. Nor does it help that, almost half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the portrayal of psychopathic killers on the screen in "Psycho," Tierney's is so crude and obvious that he could have tattooed "PSYCHO" on his forehead. In addition, there is no indication in the film as to why the original novel was called "More lethal than the male", but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment of Robert Wise, who already had some quality films to his credit and would follow a stellar career.
