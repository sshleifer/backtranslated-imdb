This is the worst movie I've seen, and the worst I'll probably see. I do not see the need to repeat what everyone else has said before, you're only warned ... <br /> <br /> This is NOT one of those bad movies that you think you want to see because you want to be able to make fun, it's simply BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This movie is the equivalent of having a "pet rock" as a friend. You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. The Lion Gate deceives completely with this bomb ... No ... this is a disaster. After watching this movie, you would swear that George W. Bush took over this movie ... yes, it's that idiot. <br /> <br /> Stay away, unless, of course, you just want to watch the movie. The worst movie of all time. That's probably how he figured Lion's Gate would make some money with this piece of gut.
