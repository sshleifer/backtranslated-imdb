The worst thing about this movie is that it did not have to be that terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, but also many movies; they made him look elegant and beautiful, and best of all was that they had the lesbian 21st century audience that would embrace a positive lesbian movie ... and yet, the writer and the director did everything possible to get each film remade. The torment and confusion of the lesbians in the boarding schools (you know, the place where all the lesbians' love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been done over and over again and AGAIN in the movie, but something that the viewers - if this voting forum is used as a clue - seems to not have enough. <br /> <br /> Each element of this story was so exaggerated, excessively false and artificial that it was painful to sit down. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, genius, rebellious lesbian and lesbian (well, they took a super pretty like Piper Perabo and tried to harass her, but she did not hit much) seduces a pretty rich girl that is destined to betray her <br /> <br /> Watching them every step of the way is character 3, a good girl, well intentioned, with good intentions and open eyes. I say 'every step' because he shares his thoughts with the public through the most rigid and crazy monologues. <br /> <br /> Its lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen-year-old boy, although they're trying, oh, so hard to sound like a fifteen-year-old would, um, you know, well ... talk. "Listening to them (making love) with their noises was um, you know, well, well ... good!" she says about her 2 indiscriminate roommates, who roll in the bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene, the Native American actor who is completely lost in a roll as a gardener (!) "Is it bad to worry about what people think?" <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but is she a teenager or is she 7? <br /> <br /> Of course, Piper Perabo (like Polly, the tortured dike) and others do a good job for the horrible lines they must pronounce. Perabo has a good level of energy and, obviously, is very comfortable in front of a camera. He would do well on a decent project, so this is not in any way a critique of acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is SEAMLESS by perpetuating each unique stereotype about lesbians, all in one character. They could not stop with her (Polly) being an angry, crazy, passionate and secret genius that ended the math problems for the teacher without words. Oh, but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares to accuse her of "chatting." <br /> <br /> "That is a word that THEY (men) use against the United States (women)!" she says, leaving the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is this what ALL the writers could find? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. He continued and made Polly a poetic and dark girl who communicated with the wild hawks by shouting her name in the forest. <br /> <br /> Identify the slow motion, science fiction, Xena's atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we wrote it to your biological mother ... (most lesbians are orphans hungry for love, in case you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one tense, one crazy). write with loose bows on the neck) that move around the whole action (the school looks tremendously big for only 2 teachers) ... and give the dark / seductive / bird girl a tense appearance. Hmmmm I wonder if something is fine, you know ... um, the fun is happening between these TWO MASTERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for something so badly done. The anguish happens, but surely the writer and the director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this stupid one. <br /> <br /> I can not reveal the end out of respect for those who force themselves to sit to the end, but if you're not laughing, I can only guess that you're crying. And not for the right reason. And I do not mean flimsy scenes.
