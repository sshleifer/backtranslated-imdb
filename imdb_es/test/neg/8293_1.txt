This film spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the film, but apparently there was no script when they filmed this waste of time. The trailer makes this a comedy, but the film can not decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action movie. The press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see "Free Enterprise" instead.
