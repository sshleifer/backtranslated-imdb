This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, but that they are not fun and clichés either. In the first episode, the father said something like "I wish women would not go out and look for work and have the same rights as men, blah, blah, blah." That really helps attitudes, huh? Then he was making fun of his son saying it was weird. What father says that his son is weird? So, in general, this show is boring, not original, offending, clichéd and above all NOT FUNNY. Yes, the American father is offended. But it also makes you laugh and is obviously taking the micky. That is the difference.
