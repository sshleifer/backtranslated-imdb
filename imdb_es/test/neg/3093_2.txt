They let me fool around the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film. Start incredibly slow: 35 minutes, two sad songs and one failed theft. I did not care about the characters, and the plot never tempted me to pretend that I could be realistic. I can not believe that this is what comes to the screen. I loved watching this movie because it felt so good when it was over.
