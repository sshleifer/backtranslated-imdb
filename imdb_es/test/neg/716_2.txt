Of all the post-1985 Perry Mason films I've seen, this is the least favorite. <br /> <br /> I confess that I have never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. It seems that he only knows how to interpret a type of character: a career woman with an indefinite chip on her shoulder that for that reason is extremely difficult to sympathize with. This is not an exception: it is executed in a true way. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this film, in my opinion, is a serious performance by Scott Baio as a prosecutor: I actually found myself supporting him to win, and the film is worth seeing for him alone.
