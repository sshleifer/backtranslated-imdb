(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so be careful.) <br /> <br /> A friend brought this, and we did it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed It was the only way. That this movie is seen. There were points when we were watching the film at a normal speed in which I was going, preparing part of the lunch and returning, to find that, literally, nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing more than an awkward silence to numb the mind. <br /> <br /> This is NOT how to make a reflective film, especially when the plot of the movie follows the same basic Hollywood movie. tropos If I told you that Disney was making a movie about 4 girls that make up a band, and that the singer was a French exchange student, what do you expect the "conflicts" to be? <br /> <br /> The lead singer Has to overcome stage fright? Does anyone have a tacit infatuation? Is the band late for their performance and a secondary character have to beat them time? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All those things happen in this movie. <Br /> <br /> At no time in this movie do you have the slightest fraction of concern that these girls will not be able to fulfill their goal. <br /> <br /> * THIS ENDS THE SPOILERS SECTION * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I have spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Hell, I even know all the bands that are referenced in the record collections and the MDs that are going on, and I followed the title song with friends at karaoke. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie in Japan I've ever seen. Do not get confused. Although the characters will have points in the film in which they do things typical of Japanese high school, this is not a "typical day in the life" movie. This is "one day in the life of 4 extremely random, very conflicting and uncomfortable Japanese students". <br /> <br /> There are also notable problems with the DVD. Viz decided that a great extra would be a producer who read aloud Wikipedia's entry on the Blue Hearts. What value! Also, they care so little about subtitles that the name of the band in the subtitles, "Paran Maum" is different from the chapter selection menu, "Paran Marum". In the final scene of the auditorium, there is a VERY visible effect of reflex / ghost effect on everything, but this seems to be the fault of the original movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT see it if you do not do it at all. uncomfortable love silences.
