Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist who visits England, takes charge of a hiker one night. Two years later, upon discovering the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the opulent house of man, only to discover that the man was hanged for murder. No one inside or outside the family seems to care that the hiker did not commit the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in the Sutherland car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he has appeared too late. Through a feeling of guilt, track down the real murderer. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of Agatha Christie usually involve several diverse people, all with one or another reason for the crime, all of them suspects, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. Often, not always, there is a partner with whom the researcher can discuss things. <br /> <br /> Due to the difficulty of the situation, due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or spectator. The redundancy is perfectly fine. We have to keep the characters and timelines straight. Christie's films are the rare type in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is really useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yes, that's Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production, with all that that implies in production values, a carefully prepared script and an ability behind the Camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes, in which Sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged, are fine. After that, everything is thrown at the viewer in disconnected pieces, often in sudden flashbacks or confusing voices that do not tell us anything. The script has a quality slapdash, as if they are thrown together by two hacks during the night. Few of the faces are familiar and that does not help at all. All leave comments on all the others and the names become a jumble without hope. The musical score consists of four instruments that make irritating atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is thrown to awaken the sleepers in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, I would be among the spectators who would need to be awakened. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
