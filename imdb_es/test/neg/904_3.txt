A 10-year-old boy, fed up with his arguing parents, decides to wire a car and take a surreal journey across the United States to find the Motorama cards, which is a card game from the service station, which can find to spell "Motorama" You have the possibility to earn 500 million dollars. He meets many strange characters along the way. No one can do an 'instant cult classic', the previous "After Hours" by Joe Minion was achieved by absolute merit and an incredible director, but it was not instantaneous. This movie, on the other hand, is just strange just for being strange. There is no rhyme or reason for any of that. The plot is incidental in the best of cases and seems to exist only to show several cameos. It's just not a funny or thoughtful movie. It's too slapped together. I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch's films. That's almost a heresy, since even the "worst" movie of Lynch (the worst of the quotes, since he does not really have a bad movie) is still way above this abyss. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is topless very briefly <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Trailer for "Joe Dirt"
