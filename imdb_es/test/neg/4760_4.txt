Susan Slept Here turned out to be the swan song of Dick Powell as an artist on the big screen. Of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died. It's a shame he did not come out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin has made many better films, I'm still not sure who the owner of this is. The premise is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who seeks to do things more serious than the fuzz he's been writing. He had an idea for a movie about juvenile delinquency, so two policemen friends of Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds at his door. She is not a really bad girl and they do not want to put her in the system. So they give it to Dick Powell at Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone out there who does not see a problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. In addition Powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here, surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Susan Slept Here received an Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for the best song, but lost by Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some fun moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell and Les Tremayne's factotum as his lawyer also laughs. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough.
