I'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to situation comedies these days. I'll still check them from time to time. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even those of the main networks that are receiving high scores, I do not understand who is funny to make them explode. While a few have made me smile, none of them made me laugh out loud, I usually change channels after a few minutes. Now in the FOX network they produce new programs like changing your underwear, for some reason they think they can make a good situation comedy, wrong wrong. They have beaten this dead horse so much that it is to the point of hiring anyone who can find to write a shitty pilot with a bad dialogue and simply distribute it. Let's take a brief look at the last piece of scrap that Fox has released. called "War at home" <br /> <br /> I saw it about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter is telling her parents that they are becoming an adult, now I am ranting. The dad got fed up and says: "Okay, go ahead and do what you want, if you fucked up, it's your problem" to which she responds: "Well, I guess you're angry, but well, at least I did not get AIDS "(inquires into the laughter trail, in no way can it be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud that garbage). about not having AIDS to be in such bad taste. Well, hey, at least I do not have to see anything else about this shit. Take a FOX track, stop wasting time with comedies. Well, you have the Simpsons, but now he's also getting very old and tired.
