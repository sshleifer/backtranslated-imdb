This is only the second time that I have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times have been for films that can be described with several 4-letter words that can be defined as excrement or excrement. the other movie of such caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> In any revision, there are several key things that are wrong with this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Steven has lost the plot (that is, in all his other films, his family / friend is murdered, Steven gets angry, Steven kills people in the end). <br /> <br /> 2) Steven has run out of money (there was a good car chase scene at first, but I think he blew up his budget and could not afford a decent scriptwriter or editor). <br /> <br /> 3) Steven does not seem to do his thing anymore. action. instead, the fight (memory) scenes 2 were fired from the back, so you could not really see her face. Most likely a double trick. I'm guessing Chuck Norris. <br /> <br /> in short ... the worst Seagal movie. The second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen many bad movies.
