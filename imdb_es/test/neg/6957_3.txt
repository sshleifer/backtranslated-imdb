First of all, this movie leaves you in a wise limbo. You do not know what to feel. So much so that you do not feel bad for the character of Caines when his son is murdered (which in fact was mainly due to a bad edition). The script was too soft. Neither situation matters while you look at it. The soundtrack, or lack thereof (if there was one, was not good enough to remember it) does not help at all. The only surprise for this movie was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was on par, if not better than Caine's. The story would probably have been better if Serkis had killed him. Because frankly you do not feel any kind of redemption at the climax. Only a feeling of lack of feeling, if you feel me. Basically, this film is massively lacking in drawing. Leaving the audience alienated throughout the whole affair.
