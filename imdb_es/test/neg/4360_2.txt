That is not saying much. This film by Killjoy has a better picture and is more professional than the previous one. That does not mean it sounds more professional. That last horrible movie was about gangsters killing a child and then being chased by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy in the last one was a bad actor, but wow! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've seen in any movie, and I've seen many movies. The last film in which the clown arrived in about 15 minutes, this is shorter and the clown does not even arrive in 40 minutes, and only lasts 65 minutes. I give it a 2 because the performance of some characters is fine.
