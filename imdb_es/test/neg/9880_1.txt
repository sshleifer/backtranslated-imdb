OK, to begin with, this movie did not look like the book at all. I read the book when I was 13 years old and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I'm writing to complete the time. I have 3 copies for the love of God. Anyway, I knew this was not going to be like the book, but come on! They could have done it a little better than this. I mean seriously if I would like to see the American werewolf in Paris or London than I would see those movies. They took a perfectly good story and turned it into a copy of a story that has been told over and over and frankly I'm tired of seeing it. I mean, hello, the best part of the whole f ***** g story (sorry) is that she ends up with Gabriel. He does not die. What was that? And he is old in this movie. It is assumed that Gabriel has only 24 not 44 gives **. Awww. And Astrid, who came up with it, came up with the idea that Astrid was Vivian's aunt, no, no, no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway, yes, that was my little diatribe, seriously, saying goodbye. I hope this has helped.
