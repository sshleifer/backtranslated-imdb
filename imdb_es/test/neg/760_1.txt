A horrible movie; badly written, badly acted, clich√©, trite, scum. The premise is very good and the opportunity to educate about black jeans, but the movie is really terrible. It's a curious mix of a bad Randolph Scott B movie in the 1950s and a bad western spaghetti from the 1970s. The villains are cartons, the ridiculous flashbacks, the unbearable dialogue. <br /> <br /> Deliberate anachronisms (such as 'Victorian' rap singers and modern words like 'motherf **** er') are irritating to the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster that died at the laboratory table.
