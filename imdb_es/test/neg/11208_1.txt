For many years I saw this movie as a true ninja movie, but after studying more about this culture, I can only think that this is just another karate movie. A black shinobi and some weapons do not make a ninja, it is much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warriors in Japan because they are trained in all aspects of life to survive anything, killing any attempt to stop them. This movie is not about a ninja warrior, but about a clown who tries to be something he can not even understand.
