"Shade" tries to be another "Sting", substituting poker for horse racing as the means to knock down an enemy, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I watched everything and I never could. I understand why the boy wanted to double cross with his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girl? Is there a woman in the world who is worth getting into so much trouble? If there is, it certainly was not this shrew. He had no redeeming qualities at all, and really now, did he really have a special room set up so that a surgeon could extract the kidney from whoever tried to pick it up at a bar? Dina Merrill makes a brief appearance as a rich woman who organizes, of all things, paid poker parties in her palatial home. And then the players say things like: "I'll see your thousands and I'll upload another five thousand." Give me a break. You can not call ("see") and upload, you do one or the other. Any child who plays for nickels at the kitchen table knows this; You would think that adult men who play such high bets, or at least the knuckles that wrote the script, would also know it. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned that there is not a high limit poker game. I would allow the players to hand out their own cards and I agree. Do not allow two of the best-known car tricks to enter a game in which the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then let them deal with each other. That is not poker; that's just to see which one can cheat better. And I would like to know which person in their right mind would participate in a game in which they play two of the best-known card cheats and hope they have the chance to win? And above all, what mafia boss would run a game like that? Every time Melanie Griffith appeared on the screen, I was fascinated by those gigantic red fluorescent lips of her own that completely lost the story, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery that went wrong than a connection of love. Stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before buying the restaurant she now runs, but we do not know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with Stallone in her younger days, so we wonder if we even care a lot. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but they kill him immediately and we're left with cardboard cutouts that all look like them 're reading their lines from a teleprompter outside the camera. <br /> <br /> The ending does not make sense either. Does the child leave the game and simply walk down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is not seen anywhere? Is the mafia not watching every movement it makes? Do everyone else simply shrug their shoulders and silently accept the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recover any of that? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this movie is a great injustice for professional poker players around the world, implying that the only way to win is to bet cards and play with "juiced". "Covers, and why are kings and aces always palms? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are the tricks of the game of hands during the start and end credits, everything in between is ridiculous.
