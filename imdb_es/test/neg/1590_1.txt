This movie was playing on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched the first 20 minutes and then turned it off b / c I'm sorry, but the holes that are an integral part of the plot of a movie make the movie just trash. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle that leaves the road, goes to seek help, returns only to discover that it is called hitting and running, and there is a search for the "monster" that hurt her (in the end he killed her). <br /> <br /> This is a film about a woman in an affluent neighborhood who has 2 children in elementary school and who is an active and sociable woman and yet, for this film to work, it must be credible that Do it. He does not own a cell phone. I'm sorry, but that's BS complete, especially when everyone else seems to have one; They used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road, when our female leader left the crime scene to call 911 at some point. public telephone of coins. When the woman leader returns, the ambulance is already next to the girl and it is talked about how horrible is the person who hit her and left her. <br /> <br /> Only DUMB. I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to buy that this woman does not have a cell phone that is needed for the movie to work. Please, do not insult my intelligence movie, thank you. Maybe if this happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it but it's clearly a current movie (1999 at that time). ..but wait, if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman knows clearly about the technology since she had computers in her house, in which the children played games, so all the film had to do was make her cell phone die in the car, make her resort to it. another way to call the police ... leaving aside a cell phone only created a ridiculous plot.
