I love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the room, because they were shot back to back. but after finally seeing a copy, I must say that it was not better than the number 5. To begin with, my expectations were not high, but this is cheap material for direct video, not even a horror movie, it's PG -13. The performance was not convincing, the story was quite silly without any emotion and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no deaths or gore (the annoying child who dies in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but let's go ...) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by Sequel's director, Jeff Burr, who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing more than a tribute to the best scenes of all the films. <br /> <br /> In general, Puppet Master is very similar to the Hellraiser series: a great trilogy, but forget the rest ..
