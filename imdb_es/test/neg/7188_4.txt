Let me start with a terrible story and a horrible control system. Good animation but not very good graphics. that's why I give this game 4 out of 10. THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS AN IMPROVEMENT IF YOU ASK ME! I would do it again and improve this control system so that the jaws are not so difficult to control. If I did it to improve it, I would make those graphics look better than in the movie. It will drive anyone crazy when they kill you, so you go crazy. I played this and a diver killed me when he had one of those knives on 2 hits. The dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will pray to go to the bottom of hell. This game sucks a little fat ass I'm sorry for all the curses that I think I've finished now. it's just that this game is so bad that it should be removed from the store's shelf. I challenge you to play junk and probably get so angry when you die so easy, so DO NOT PLAY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
