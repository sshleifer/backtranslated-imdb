Last week I saw a Macbeth production of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was 25 years old, filmed without accessories, except swords, without furniture, except chairs. It was riveted. The acting was super - all British trained actors. Contrast that performance to this ... yawn yawn yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy and could not lose the New York accent, despite the long ... pauses ... between ... lines ... Everything was soporific Even the "comic" scenes just They were worth to smile, to let a loner laugh. This is supposed to be fun. They tried to make it tragic. It was not even, just boring. I give him four points for costumes, set design and Jeremy Irons, which is good for playing a boring, depressed and deep-voiced guy (can it be anything else?)
