Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a deeply unhappy teenager, the son of his parents unhappily married. Her father, (Nicholas Farrell), is a vicar and her mother, (Laura Linney), is ... well, let's say she is a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It is only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to an eccentric, once famous and now forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters), who finally finds himself in the true form of "Harold and Maude". Of course, Evie is deeply unhappy and it is only when these two sad sacks meet that they can put aside their mutual misery and take the path of happiness. <br /> <br /> Of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a difficult side, and Walters, who could walk sleeping on his way if he wanted, is excellent. It's when she puts the madness aside and finds the pathos in the character, (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink), which is at its best. The problem is that she is the only interesting character in the movie (and it's not because of the script that she does no favor to anyone). Grint, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; It's also a bit boring, while Linney's starchy bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still, she has Pat's English accent). The best that can be said is that it is slightly pleasant, with the emphasis on the soft.
