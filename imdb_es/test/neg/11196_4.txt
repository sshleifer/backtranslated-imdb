The summary was promising, but watching the film was a big disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The plot is linear and without surprises. The normal characters remain normal until the end of the movie, the strange characters remain strange until the end of the movie. There is not even a single attempt to deceive the spectator by making him believe that the bad guy is someone else than the most obvious candidate. On the positive side, the actors play quite well, and there is a bit of atmosphere in the film, but too little to be meaningful. <br /> <br /> The people who vote 10 for this movie either do not watch it, or they are members of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
