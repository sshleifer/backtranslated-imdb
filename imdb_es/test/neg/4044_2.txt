To have to really recognize making such a horrible movie! Actually, I'm more ashamed that I sat through the whole thing. It looks like an old 80s science fiction movie complete with fake-looking "special effects", weird images and very kitschy dialogues. Maybe that's how they wanted it to look like, maybe they think it's great to make 80s fashion movies, because it will come back in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think that the promising appeal will save the film, a disappointment awaits you: the so-called "babies" are manly and downright ugly. They can not act at all, I do not understand why, at least, they can not get attractive girls if they want babies without talent! But I guess when you make such a stupid movie, you do not have very good choices, good girls do not just stand in line to do this kind of pitiful shit!
