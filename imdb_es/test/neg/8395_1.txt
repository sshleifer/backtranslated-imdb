Honestly, this movie is the worst crap I've seen. This is slow, plot less and boring. The cinematographer deserved to be shot. There were several aspects of the unintentional comedy, one of which was that Jared was strangely in the camp. He raised a lot of laughter but also many yawns. Do not look with anyone, anytime and anywhere. If you hate someone, I recommend buying or renting this. Great waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant ... no. I can not think of anything else to say, except "Never watch this movie", it will make you want to jump off a cliff. Hope Gus and his friends read this comment before it's too late and makes a sequel or some other catastrophe with what seemed to have been filmed with a camera phone.
