In general, any movie with Steve Railsback at the head is a good movie. However, this movie does not fit that opinion. Lifeforce is a below-average movie that is extremely confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to improve a bit towards the end when London becomes Zombie City. A horror / science fiction mess in which it is very difficult to sit down, although the space vampire / vampire is very easy to see. This movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
