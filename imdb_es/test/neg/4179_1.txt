If you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent it, go buy an ice pack and watch it melt. That's more entertaining than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, it's your fault. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to see this plot of the movie, go to a corn field, bring two of the most annoying girls you can find, run for a couple of hours making the girls scream the most strong possible. Then, send me the dollars you would have spent. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the first dark harvest, after seeing the sequel, I will cry to sleep.
