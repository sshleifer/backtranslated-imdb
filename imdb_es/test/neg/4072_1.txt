This movie is so bad that it's worth seeing. This movie will make the spectators enter and leave a comma within the first 10 minutes. It all started when a group of writers came up with the idea that a line plane was hijacked and a passenger who can fly in a small plane has to land the beast. However, they know that it has been done many times before, so to do it differently, let's do it very badly! Major Masters has pirated his name from the 80s movie "To Live and Die in L.A." Of the character played by Willem Dafoe. That saved 10 minutes in write time and production. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. That plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic front hump on top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan, who lamented this point when the Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the 1980s. However, when the plane takes off, it is clearly not a 747, it looks more like a 767. This well-researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cabin and replaces it with two comfortable seats. There is no need for a flight engineer in this complex plane! The heroine is played by Gloria Lynn Berg perpetually in puchero. After tying the kidnapper, despite the many buses full of people in this jumbo jet, nobody bothers to see this guy who almost kills them all. He was simply forced to have fun. <br /> <br /> The crippled plane, leaking fuel from all the scams that were not hijacked will not return to Hawaii, so Masters will attempt to land at an Air Force base located on an island. Only 300 feet from the track too short! Four army boys with small Bobcats (the kind you rent to carry around a horse manure to the back of your barn all day), will clean a 200-foot-wide, 300-foot-long strip through the jungle in 20 minutes! No need for an excavator here! Where can you find guys like this? These guys could make a road between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with scoops, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> After that hellish obstacle is fixed, Masters will attempt to land the plane as heroine pouts away. Hijacker laughs to himself and unsupervised is released to cause more problems. Finally he is submitted in the most delayed manner that I can not tell you. But can you say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many delayed scenes in this movie. The injured captain is parked face down on the plane's bar, while Masters, who is supposedly barely able to fly, places the plane in banks of 60 degrees and falls of 20,000 feet per minute. The pilot should be French kissing the roof during these challenging maneuvers, but he does not move an inch. <br /> <br /> I think that if they had chosen different actors to interpret the parts, this movement could have been much better. If we need a heroine to pout the movie, why not choose the well-known actress Bernadette Peters, who also always seems to be pouting? In addition, she can sing and the old and busty Peters could present some free neckline shots. Now, with the singing angle, this could be a kidnapping, Let's land the movie of the MUSICAL plane! Luciano Pavarotti cast as the pilot. They can sing a duo in the cockpit before the abduction and there's no way the plump tenor can fly to the roof while Masters does his magic on that great bird. According to the musical theme, Masters could be played by Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peters Can can sing while the plane lands. Not only is he totally blind, he also knows a couple of words in English. Now that is a plot! Think of the edge of your seat conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the air traffic controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, please accelerate back to 180, fixed fins to 25 degrees. 230 course "<br /> <br /> Bocelli:" What? " <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, spoil the spoilers now, confirm the brake pressure to 250 psi, keep the descent to 500 fpm". <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The kidnapper could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can throw a plethora of his linings while sitting moored and unguarded: "I have no respect." My wife is in group sex Yes, he screwed me up in front of the judge and the jury! Do you have the idea? <br /> <br /> LOST OPPORTUNITIES The film has your usual passengers crying and moaning that they never develop Woody Allen could have been in the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: "She said it was great in bed. I told him to practice a lot ... "THIS IS a movie! <br /> <br /> Also, according to the similar movie" Executive Decision ", in which the lazy Steven Segal is fortunately killed at the beginning and Give that movie a shot, the 747 have huge penthouses upstairs, the plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years, my uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all kinds It would not have been all right if Masters opened the trap door and saw a watery-eyed Chevy Chase in a woman's robe watching old Super 8 movies from her childhood ... Just a recommendation. <br / > <br /> So give it a try, and when you come in and out of consciousness, imagine how great this movie could have been if I had my hand in it ...
