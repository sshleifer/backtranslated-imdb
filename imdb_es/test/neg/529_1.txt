Just horrible I include a spoiler warning here only to include jokes from the movie: there is nothing more to spoil, since it is already rotten. This scum was made during what must have been one of the "For a few dollars more" periods of Sellers, when he participated in any trash for a few dollars. I had seen this as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972, and I hated it then. There is no need to see it again; After 35 years, I now remember him as one of the five worst movies I had seen as a child. As I recall, Sellers had more of a cameo in progress than a protagonist here, but even his presence could not improve the old jokes, the boring plot and the child reparation. An ongoing theme revolves around Sellers' use of his fingers: in one scene, he raises his open hand to a group of doctors, and by doubling his fingers, lists the groups for which there is a hospital: the inmates, the nurses, administrators, etc. - until only the middle finger remains up, after which it says "... and the patients!" Har Har. In another scene, to avoid costly laboratory tests, he puts a finger in a urine sample and puts it in his mouth to check for sugar, and then exhorts the inmates who gathered around him to do the same, what they do. Then he warns them that he placed his middle finger in the urine, but sucked his index finger, and warned them to pay attention. Hee Hee (The only reason I remember this, and this movie, and I'm writing this review, is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this "joke" today). If you are in this, you will love it. If not, see 'Hospital', with George C. Scott (left the same year, 1972) to get a genuine and wonderful black doctor humor. Better yet, read Samuel Shem's "The House of God," and if you can, see the movie version, which has never been published (make a copy and send it to me, I'd love to see that eventually).
