The comments that have been left for this show are much more fun than the program itself and all are accurate. I feel exactly the same way, that I am very disappointed by how much Rick Mercer has fallen when he used to do some really cool things in This hour has 22 minutes, but now he's just doing antics, going places and talking to people. He makes some fragments in the studio about the things that happen in the news, but they are never funny, just sad and predictable jokes about the headlines. Most of his program is that he goes somewhere to talk to people, for example, this week he goes to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making faces and acting scared of wild horses, etc. It used to be fun, but it has become less fun since this hour has 22 minutes and that show is not fun at all either. Now that Air Farce is out of the air (at last, thank God!) Mercer and This Hour 22 Minutes have to be next on the list for the ax, just an old and tired comedy that almost nobody finds fun. It's sad to really think that Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian television!
