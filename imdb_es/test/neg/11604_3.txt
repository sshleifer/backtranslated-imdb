Alfred Hitchcock did this comedy of bad marriage in 1941, but his heart does not seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover that they never got married legally and spend the movie fighting to return to true love. It does not have a lot of reputation and it's easy to see why. The jokes are familiar with better films, but here they do not fit. And the cables are not very charismatic. Lombard's performance is clipped and starched and it's doubly sad to think that she died only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he is in the ear of a sow and does his best to make a silk bag without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as 'the other man' (he has a lovely drunk scene). This is one of the few really bad films of Hitchcock.
