The story drags. The drug traffickers are beautiful women and a determined policeman. Nothing that has not been done hundreds of times before. The boat that is worth waiting for. Amsterdam is the perfect city to achieve it. Canals and waterways place it on the edge of your seat. I would say the same as the persecution in Bullitt, very intense!
