I bought this on VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home I checked IMDb and it was like OMG: the legendary "Nurse Sherri"! So here is another from Al Adamson, who clearly had learned something minuscule about making films since the days of "Blood of Dracula's Castle." Where that previous effort is a bulk more or less wholly sclerotic, it mixes it a little, adding a definite element of variety and surprise in the midst of incompetence. Surely half of the movie is a post-operative blind soccer player who shoots the breeze with his nurse piled up, but at any moment we can be cutting off the disembodied head of the Satanist master cult, or Nurse Sherri directing a farmer with a hairpin , or a small abstract cut of the student movie to accompany the effects of pulses in the possession scene, or the funniest topless drink of all time, or God knows what else (I forget, to be honest). Like pieces of shithead, it goes to the high end. Congratulations, Al.
