This is a situation of new clothes of an emperor. Someone has to say "It's not a funny and original movie, (etc., etc.) It's a lower movie Do not waste your money on it". The film is of poor quality, and the people in it are shamefully inferior. They are too realistic only themselves. They do not have lines, they do not act. The American dream is not to create shoddy films of poor quality or anything else of poor quality and without quality; It is to achieve something of quality and, therefore, of success. Only people who are desperate to praise any movie that has not been made in Hollywood (you can not have done it in Hollywood, right?) Will try to attribute any kind of quality to this movie. It's worse than "Ed Woods", another film about a filmmaker without standards. These movies should not have been made, and you should not go see "American Movie."
