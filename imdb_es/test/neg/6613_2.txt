This movie probably seemed like a great idea in preproduction. "Let's make a movie about one of the biggest and most controversial athletic trainers of the modern era! And cast Brian Dennehey as coach Bobby Knight!" That's where this movie went terribly wrong. Why choose an actor who does not look like the man he is playing? And then, why let this actor turn his character into not Knight Knight, but Brian Dennehey with a red sweater? While I was sitting down to watch this movie on ESPN, I did not think this man was really the Knight trainer. He did not look like him, he talked like him, he acted like him, he did not even walk like him. He could not ignore this fact and, therefore, could not enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were chosen as the proscribed Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we did not care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters, because most of us had never heard of these men until we saw the movie. But, with someone as visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you have to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was chosen as Nixon, it was the same situation. But, Anthony Hopkins made us believe that it was actually Nixon. Dennehey did not even try. What could have been a great movie became bitter for this. In addition to the fact that this film tried to do by the four-letter word what "Save Private Ryan" did by dismemberment, it stunk. Too little of the true Coach Knight and too much blasphemy for the value of the shock, turned this film into a "season to go off mid-transmission". The only good thing about this is that it was a movie for television. I did not have to spend my hard earned money on this piece of garbage.
