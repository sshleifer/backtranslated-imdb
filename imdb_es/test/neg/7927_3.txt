Where do I start? The plot of the film, which deals with the love between two high school students during the war, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi that also became an anime in 2002, both of which I still have to read or see. <br /> <br /> However, this review is about this live action adaptation. Unfortunately, this honest kindness was a terrible movie. It is not as if one could locate certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is the culprit or that the action is the culprit. It is, unfortunately, a series of insufficient and ineffective elements that bring down this film. <br /> <br /> The performance is poor. I do not mean that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they did not have much to work with, and they seemed to be grumpy. Neither of them seemed to have the physical range to attract the viewer in the story, besides being too old to distract him. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the protagonists act unrealistically and behave irrationally. The film also plays for hearts, but ends up being predictable, while not convincing, and underdevelops the characters. There are also rhythm problems. <br /> <br /> Visually, there's nothing special about it. The film uses the green screen largely and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects also have an economic aspect, especially when minimalist practical special effects could have been used. Nor is there a visual touch, as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound effects were fine, but they are not remarkable at all. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not without fun, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion. People who are not familiar with Saikano, probably this is not the place to jump, since it is not a good movie or a melodrama. It's not the fault of the movie or the cast and crew, it's just not inspired, and that's what kills her.
