The most enjoyable parts of this movie were the clips from the original movie. The performance was poor and the premise of the sexual scorecards was disgusting. The effects were marginal at best. There were no outstanding performances, Amy Irving was put on this movie to try to get a part of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more pleasant and rewarding. I'm sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the 10 best years ... so far it's at the bottom of my list. Do not bother with these people!
