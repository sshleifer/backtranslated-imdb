I just watched that movie and it disappointed me a lot. I did not expect much to begin with, since the premise of the movie does not suggest greatness anyway. Unfortunately, it does not even manage to offer such stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably acting. While I've seen much worse actors in much worse movies, the story would require some people to behave like violent maniacs, others like people caught in a really stressful situation, and fail to do so. Although I saw the release in German, I saw it with the original audio, so it's definitely not just voice-overs or anything like that. Added to that, the release of the German DVD seems to be cut, the murders are practically on the sidelines, which means that, except for some semi-bloody scenes closer to the end, the German release does not present itself as a movie for "gore-" hunting dogs, "either. I can not comment on that for other releases, of course. The plot has some stupid moments thrown here and there, and the beginning is simply funny (have you heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Pity that the film is taken too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a bit here and there, consequently, it could have worked better. The end is just a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing better to do and you can not stand boredom anymore, you can (and it's really a weak "power") consider this movie. If there is something else to see or do: choose that alternative.
