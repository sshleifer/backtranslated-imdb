A decent but overrated dramatic thriller, the film tries to depict the uncontrolled inner demons of a tormented artist. The problem is that a single illustrated relationship on the screen is not credible, and it seems that plausibility has been thrown out the window. The title character is so difficult to relate to the fact that it is quite impossible to imagine any of the characters on the screen being emotionally involved in it either. The conclusion is also quite predictable; there are certainly enough clues provided from the beginning to indicate exactly where the story is going. By choosing to completely suspend belief in situations or relationships, the film itself is well acted (especially by potential clients) and manages to create a good tension as the story unfolds. As a metaphorical characteristic there is something to think about, and if the script had been stronger, here is a potential that could have been better exploited.
