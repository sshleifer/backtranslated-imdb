Why did they change the cute Rugrats TV show that we all know and love in an unconvincing attempt to target teenagers? They do not have to do that. All ages look at the regular Rugrats. When I heard about this, I thought, "Hey, they did a television series about the movie, except they really grew up as teenagers, this is going to be better." When I saw it, it was as if I was watching As Told By Ginger, except that they did suck. Good job. <br /> <br /> When in the Rugrats series has Tommy been a director? Never. Basically, all the episodes in this series attempt are about Tommy's love for directing. I do not like that I prefer to see plots that change each episode. It is not the same again and again. Also, when in the previous series did each character have their own version of the story? Never. This series did that. I did not like that everyone separated. I do not want to see Angelica's side of the story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this program if you like As Told By Ginger and the Rugrats.
