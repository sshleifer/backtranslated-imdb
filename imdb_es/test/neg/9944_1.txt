This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It is supposed to be a new version or update of "The One-arms Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. The punching direction and the shitty fight choreography mean that the fight scenes are not even worth seeing. The script tries desperately to look serious, but it is full of clich√©s like: "And then I knew that nothing would be the same again ..." or "If I had known the price so high I would have to pay". "Ugh! And who is that girl who plays singing? Somebody finds her and kills her!" She's horrible If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you'd be better off with Lau Gar Leung.
