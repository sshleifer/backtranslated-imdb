If this movie is coming to a theater near you, consider it a threat. I had the bad luck to see this movie here in Tokyo. Being Dutch, I was surprised to find a Dutch movie in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it had to be something special if a Dutch film reaches Japan. So I went there with some friends, and we happily told the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were very curious about the movie. It turned out that he was one of the most childish, stupid, dumbest, worst acting, with the worst English-speaking movie I've seen in maybe 10 years, and I left the cinema trying to avoid the staff, because I felt almost responsible for this movie. disaster Sometimes you have the feeling of knowing what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt, a type of Trainspotting movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I did not feel too upset, the movie was, unintentionally, quite hilarious from time to time, as it showed Holland at its smallest point.
