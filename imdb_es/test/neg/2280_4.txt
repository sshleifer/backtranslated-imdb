This is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie, and the oldest one that, obviously, still exists. This historical piece of the film is the opening segment on the DVD "More treasures of natural archives". <br /> <br /> It's just a 15-second video of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Next to him there are two men dancing. Near the end, another man walks on the stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This "movie" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really a success. From this point, it took more than 30 years to synchronize the view and sound to the point where you could broadcast something to the audience for entertainment. However, this was a start, no matter how primitive it may have been. <br /> <br /> For more technical and historical information on this film process, see the other review here by "Boba Fett1138".
