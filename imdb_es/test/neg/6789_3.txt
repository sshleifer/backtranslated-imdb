I never thought I would get caught saying this: But I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more entertaining than the police drama of the 90s. Walker is very melodramatic and actually sets a standard for the genre of "High" police programs Octane "as CSI, CSI: Miami, etc. I'm not saying that all these programs are bad, but they're not good either. I like the chop karate action that Walker dispenses to the enemies of justice and the diversity of characters as well as the scientific technology of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / counter-types! That's right, stereotypes / counter-types! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to let go of the old prejudices of antiquity, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a child with psychic powers ventures into Dallas, where he meets a group of children in gothic / punk clothes and begins to harass him. Now! This is exactly what Middle America perceives the Gothic / punk culture. I mean, come on, how often do people who dress like this steal and steal from people who only think about their own affairs? Whenever there are blacks and Latinos in the plot, they are always gangs in an impoverished neighborhood. Good! Not all who are a minority are a desperate recruit from a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people. Finally, why is the triveta the clumsy partner, can not you make the partner equal?
