I must give Billy Dee credit for trying to achieve this. Knowing that this was a blaxploitation movie, I started my DVD with some expectation. I knew that it would be low budget ... the underparado in functions ... but I hoped that some gems would be scattered. If there were diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or perhaps exaggerating. As an actor and filmmaker, I often cringed when potential poignant moments were ruined by atrocious performances. However, I must admit that I could not look the other way. I do not know if this was like a car accident that you can not look away from, or some mysterious power in the movie that kept me there. This movie is a good case for an excellent story that was told badly. If Walter Kronkite told the joke of "the aristocrats", it would be a total failure, although the joke itself is very funny. Let Dave Chappelle tell it, and we're all rolling on the floor laughing. This movie needed a "chapel". Now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I made, do it. It is well worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and redo it. Who knows ... it may not be better, but surely it can not be worse.
