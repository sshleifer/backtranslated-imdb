An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes an artist and then discovers himself and returns to the United States to fix things with his old friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that the people who rate this movie so high are all X Files fans, even if there are no extraterrestrials or serial killers. Do not be fooled, this movie makes pieces. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you receive an explanation, it does not fit the story that preceded it. What it does is bore you. For all the talents that act in the movie, it's just not interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when the sex addict Duchovny was going to hit someone. Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; They should have filmed that in their place. <br /> <br /> What appears is the story of a self-obsessed artist who worries about minor incidents in his life and wants to correct them in some way, although they did not seem so. bad to start. There is no particularly interesting or shocking revelation, despite the mention of a great secret in the first few minutes. He's just a boy who thinks his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week, that's completely believable. The man can act, there is no doubt, but the writing and the direction are obviously beyond his talent. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood continues to illuminate these stories of self-discovery is beyond me. I discover myself in the shower every morning, but I do not bother to make a film about it. Mine would probably be better than this, however; At least there would be some nudity.
