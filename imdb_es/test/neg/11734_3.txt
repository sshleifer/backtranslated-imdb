The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely considered the best work of Alfred Hitchcock and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best films of all time. The decision to shoot a remake shot by shot is, therefore, a bit disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The cast in the original was impeccable, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good option for the lead. He's too handsome for boys and not as convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job on paper. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a credible job, but one continues to compare her mentally with Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here, and Viggio Mortenson simply fulfills her role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as a private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can not create the suspense the way Hitchcock did. And why did the scene change in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark, damp and closed, while in this version, it takes place in a highly lit laboratory environment. And I think that the black and white photography of the original has a clear advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another flaw could be the fact that most viewers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if it's not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
