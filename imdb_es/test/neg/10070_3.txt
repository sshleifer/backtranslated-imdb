JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch. It is a total assault on the senses with dinosaurs "in your face". Watching this movie was a bit like a roller coaster from hell. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. Also, we really can not appreciate the humans in the movie for all they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is a talent too big to have to compete with dinosaurs to get our attention. And Laura Dern was especially understanding in JP1; In this movie, she is just a point on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was t o m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying, too much predictable and gratuitous violence. <br /> <br /> Word to wise: vote yourself from this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated it with a 3 for special effects, I removed the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)
