This movie was NOT ANYTHING like the book. I think the screenwriter must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to Gone with the Wind and being rejected. This was his way of expressing his ideas in any way. The only similarity between this film and the story it portrayed were the names of the main characters and the location of the main action. None of the events shown in the movie happened that way in the book. For a fan of Gone with the Wind (both the book and the film) this was deeply disappointing. If you loved the Scarlett book, do not watch this movie with the hope of seeing it on the screen. Only share the title in common.
