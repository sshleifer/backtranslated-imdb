I just do not understand. Why call this a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when it has absolutely no connection with it at all? The first movie was fun * and * terrifying with innovative special effects. (If the memory serves, the Oscar category for special makeup effects was * created * for this movie). "Paris" is none of these things. Terrible effects, and not much more. Do not watch this movie. Rent the original "Werewolf in London" instead. You will be much happier.
