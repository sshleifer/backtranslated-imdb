Describing this movie is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is a ghost of exaggerated vampires, complete with cobwebs, spooky music, a hypnotic medallion and, of course, a coffin with a crispy lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the dumbest scripts on this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires ", and the predecessor of this film, the modestly titled" The Vampire, "The film adheres to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, this movie is a sequel to "The Vampire", which I have not seen. But it does not matter ... it's very easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is stunned when the well-intentioned but mistaken Dr. Marion returns the body of his vampiric enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that says that all Vampires must be accounts of some kind). Dr. Marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some type of serious theft to advance their medical studies, and hopes to use the corpse of the vampire to study phenomena such as lack of reflection normal vampire At what point holds a mirror for the vampire and instead of not reflecting, we see the skeleton of the vampire. ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not happy, and seems determined to ignore the events of the First Film as mere fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit he liked to drink some blood, but that's it!" he affirms. Also the confusing issues are the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and a part-time chorister (!) Which turns out to be Enrique's object of affection. Martha narrowly escaped De Lavud's clutches in the first film, and apparently, Enrique has spent a lot of time "healing his mind" and made her think that everything she experienced was not real. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if you were the scriptwriter for this movie, you would need a way to get someone foolish enough to get the stake out of the vampire, right? Well, what about the greedy con man who helped Marion steal the coffin? After taking a look at Lavud's body, he notices the expensive-looking brooch worn by the Count, and conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors are not looking. But damn it ... you can not remove the brooch because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud returns to walk loose, this time with the dark shadow as his human henchman. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, the vampire is behind Martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. . At first they are determined to prove that there is no real vampire, then, at the end of the film, they try to get the police to publish a bulletin of all points for "a man who is dead but still alive". ! ". <br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers make some nice turns.One of the scenes in the movie is a spooky wax museum (is there any other guy in this type of movies?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... with REAL torture and execution equipment.The film has a great sense of style, and not just in the cobwebs.A really creepy sequence has Lavud chasing after a victim through an endless series of streets and alleys, following his progress together with vague buildings without doors while illuminating the scene like a German expressionist nightmare ("Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" seems to be an influence). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly at the climax of the film, the special effects are pretty crude, even during the year it was made, and the climactic fight with De Lavud in the form of a bat. or is quite ridiculous ... but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and collapse directly above a guillotine, placed so that her head is in the perfect place to be cut by the blade, which is in danger of falling down because the retention cord has started to fall off suddenly CORRECTLY AT THIS MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he moves away from the frayed rope to scenes of Enrique trying to dodge the rubber bat, basically standing and waving his arms. It is definitely a moment of Ed Wood, if there ever was one, especially when Martha seems to revive herself and stands stunned standing just as the blade crashes. Phew! What a relief! In terms of curiosity, "The Vampire's Coffin" does not have the madness factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of this type of old horror films will appreciate atmospheric photography and the fact that The director manages to wring some real chills from this material that he has to "count" for something (haw haw).
