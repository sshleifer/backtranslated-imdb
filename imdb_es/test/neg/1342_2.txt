The Women by George Cukor remains one of the brilliant gems of 1939, the most golden and golden in Hollywood. The movie creaked and lit and the absence of males was a subtle touch, almost not noticed due to all the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City, in front of Saks. Large crowds are booming along the avenue ... but something is wrong. The photo only reveals well-dressed women (attractive and young). More spooky than I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later in a great fashion show. What New York fashion show does not have at least 5 gay men? The "no men" rule gets dull in our throats creating a strange, unbalanced and distracted world. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, the first time she is seen digging in her garden with a ridiculous outfit complete with her retro curls and waving her arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and I could understand why she was looking elsewhere. Later, in the film, it transforms into a larger look than Jennifer Aniston and keeps her arms at her sides. This seems intentional as if to say "Look! I can still be relevant!" The character of Ryan is loaded with a group of friends that do not match (insert here the comparison of Sex and the City) that, if it were real life, they would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the powerful dog, who during the course of the film realizes that the dream of her life does not make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the powerful lesbian, all attitude, without use for any of the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl to say the least. It looks false, behaves falsely and any humor that tries to prove does not work. The comment of someone here that seemed transgender was accurate. Other stars appear to rearrange the furniture of this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have called their price, put their tongues firmly in their cheeks and got something very smart and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks too much about himself for that kind of exploitation. Instead, they give us this thing that creeps awkwardly without brightness. Entire sections of dialogue are lifted from the original and placed in a scene with terrible results. At one point, Ryan exclaims something like: "This is not a 1930 movie!" No Meg, it is not.
