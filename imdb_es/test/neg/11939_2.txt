I'm not really going to waste my time in a deep analysis, I'm just going to say that I'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of being in the lead role in this nonsense, meaningless, in this Full of boring clichés until death, pathetic and unreflective attempt in the cinema! It does not make sense to try to find the positive aspects of this film, since in general it is poor in every way, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is dragged unimpeded by clichés, which has no chance. To show even 1% of your talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even in the opportunity to spend the night at home starring on the wall!
