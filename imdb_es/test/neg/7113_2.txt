Live action version of Dragonball through Taiwan. <br /> <br /> The evil lord comes to earth to obtain the seven magic balls of the dragon ... er pearls that when put together will make a dragon appear and we will grant his wish. There is a lot of action and bad comedy. <br /> <br /> What can I say that "the best way to see this movie is with many drunks but clever friends" right? I do not know. This is really bad, but fun as the really bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've seen where you really see the cables. It's a live-action caricature and it's not so far from what I've seen on the show that it makes me fear for the big budget that the American version is recording. <br /> <br /> If you have some drunken friends and you feel like picking up on a movie watch this movie. If you're going to see him sober (like me), avoid it.
