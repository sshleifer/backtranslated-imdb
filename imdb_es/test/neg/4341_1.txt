This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that just sucks. The low ambitions of the film are clearly on display when the terrorists take the Vice President hostage and he has to call the White House to beg them to transfer some money. In most films of this genre, the President is kidnapped or held as a hostage because, after all, he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with the nuclear button, etc. Would most Americans really be worried if Dick Cheney had been? kidnapped? The honest answer is- probably not. Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to carry out their operation and why, despite the numerous explosions that surround them, the audience inside the hockey stadium does not take into account the situation, they are unanswered questions. Let's say this movie is really horrible, not hockey. Those who liked the movie and found it exciting should get a life.
