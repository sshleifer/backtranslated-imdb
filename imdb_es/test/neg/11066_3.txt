Monday, October 2, 2006 So I joined my dad as I always do. We order some Japanese food, turn off the lights and push the game. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was definitely a disappointment. It seemed promising, fulfilling all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: starting with an antagonistic character present, a scene of sex that can not be omitted, and the overly familiar pre-ghost (when you get scared unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot friend). Then, finally, when he reached the minimum point, he was ready for a real bloody action. The director, I admit, was enthusiastic. Of course, you should complete 81 full minutes with people running in a space about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some "cavers" who go to the university come together for another cave dive. They all look like experienced professionals, very serious and spiritual about the entire cave experience. This time they bring a new, an annoying photographer also blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the dangers of cave diving. As they descend deeply into what they call "The Well's Hell," they soon realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. If you're not naive enough not to follow my advice and avoid wasting your time, I'll leave out any spoilers. Although the atmosphere and the background music were scary; and there was a lot of blood and blood, when the moments approached to witness a real dismemberment, it was more like watching pornography without the full front. The work of the camera was deliberately dark and superficial. I guess the director used it for his effect. I guess what I like most about the movie were the characters in movement. They deserved the Acadamy Awards for those moving scenes. I almost shed a tear when they finally "got it" ... A tear of joy! If you like dry terror, soft porn and you hate Braveheart. Then this is the correct movie for your next Saturday night.
