There is a reason to call this a teen movie. Of the 100 possible points, I would put it somewhere in adolescence. It is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all it is super predictable. The ending is so silly that I should have left early and maybe it would have happened. By the way, could you call the male leader pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said it. Finally, at the school I grew up in, despite the fact that the average class had more than 1000 students, we could have chosen an imbecile like Josie for being a fraud and we would have separated her from the crowd. My last word is to save time, when it comes on television to see something better, like stock quotes.
