Oh God why? I'm horrified by the sheer ineptitude of these delicious nonsense ... as if all that made sense. Well, like this movie from the lowest poverty row of the 1940s in Hollywood, there is nothing in this door that hits the horror, done in three sets, it makes a lot of sense ... except the tenderness of Dr. Markoff (idiot?) The daughter of the player who has large melons and a bloated hairstyle.It is just terrible ... and even has a gorilla and a big dog for added distractions without meaning.More elephantine than male elephant and that is only to 62 minutes! ... THE MONSTER MAKER is the kind of movie kids in 2005 who howl in disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable fans of the movies they are today. I guess you just had to be there, in 1944, or at any moment, it was shown that this crazy nonsense to 13-year-olds impressionable in glorious velvet palaces of 3,000 seats on a wet day, somehow, it was done for no reason, by the is tackers of the movie botchville crapshooter PRC Pictures in the years of war by escaped German refugees who knew who to make a film since they left Europe when the Nazis advanced in the UFA studios ... the monster in this film, as the scientist Crazy is actually a Nazi nightmare.
