Returning to earth, Dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of asphalt in poor condition. He also has a demanding craving for blood, whether from farm animals or other human beings. <br /> <br /> Short duration of one hour and seventeen minutes; Black and white with an almost stoic performance ... typical of low budget science fiction. <br /> <br /> Completing the cast are Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe.
