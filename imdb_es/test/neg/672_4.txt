The color cinematography of Leon Shamroy's CinemaScope is quite remarkable here, including its use of color filters for various scenes. Alfred Newmann's score must be the most sensual and seductive that has ever been produced in Hollywood. It is a pity that it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, are never up to the occasion. The accents are so varied, from the faint British Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a real hodgepodge without a central vision. Tommy Rettig is incredibly American. The acting styles range from zombies to stilts. Only Ustinov, like a deceptive one-eyed servant, steals the show, what is there to steal. The premise, the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich, and the parallel theme of the worship of the one God, pursued by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the plot of the film fades, what remains is the disturbing music and visual elements.
