This joins the endless line of padlocks and predictable science fiction games of the 50s. As usual, it's pretty bad. There is not much of a plot that can detect and the excessive exaggeration of the cables only adds to the involuntary laughter. The title is deceptive too. Capturing this in MST3K is probably the only way to see it, and it's better to leave it at that.
