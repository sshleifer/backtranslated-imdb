What an atomic bomb of a movie. History does not go anywhere and does not go anywhere. Leave the theater viewer with arms raised saying "this is". What happened to Redford. He was once a just actor. Now he thinks he can appear on the set and do some scenes and it's a shot. Incorrect. What a little emotional movie. I do not want to be so cruel, but what a movie shit. Amazing amateur fuck If I were in this movie, I would be so ashamed that I would not show my face. I tell you what, if you associated me with this movie, I'm in a big problem. This film will go to the annals of film making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared.
