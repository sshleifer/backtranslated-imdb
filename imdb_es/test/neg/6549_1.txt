The only positive thing that comes to mind about this piece of junk is that I now have a good response list if someone ever asks me what is called the worst movie I saw in my life. <br /> <br /> It would have taken so little effort to make it more visible ... much more effort and it could have been brilliant even. <br /> <br /> Why would someone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director can be so ridiculously untalented. <br /> <br /> Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point. <br /> <br /> Anything else just does not make sense.
