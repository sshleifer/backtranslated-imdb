I'm still not sure what the hell this movie is. I guess the boy was afraid of going blind and started imagining all sorts of strange things. However, this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new little brother or the relentless boredom found in this movie. While watching this movie, you will want to be blind so you do not have to watch this experiment in vain. Ignore this smoking stack and opt for anything else in the video store ... anything else.
