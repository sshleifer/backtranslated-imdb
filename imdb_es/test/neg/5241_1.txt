<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie during a festival here in Munich with a large crowd of true fanatics of fantasy. Approximately in the middle of the movie, part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was booing. Bored dialogues, badly choreographed fight sequences, a terribly silly story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors did not have much to do, except that they seemed worried or (in case they were women) show their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was among the audience, admitted later that he could understand the disappointment of the spectators. Be careful, friends, about the cheapest fantasy movie in history ...
