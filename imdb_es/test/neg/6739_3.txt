When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. You expect to fight, not just many shots like in this movie. And: you expect a pretty simple story. Okay, I can live with a more complex story even if it's a Seagal movie. But this, that is, I do not know what to say. It's very, very confusing indeed. At the end of the film, I had great problems to discover what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it is almost impossible to keep track of what is happening in the movie. There are many people in the movie, people change sides all the time and change places too often. Terrible. I just do not understand why it seems that Seagal is doing a kind of sequel to this.
