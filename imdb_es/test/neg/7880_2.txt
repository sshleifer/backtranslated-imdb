I'm sick of the "open mind" argument. In general, I have a fairly open mentality, but this type of line is basically made up of people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed". You know what, there's a reason why a lot of people are upset by this. And just because someone does not do it does not make it less. After all, there is a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate that feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than living beings without meaning. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Another argument is that this film places women in the roles that are normally reserved for men, so men do not like it. But just because it's disgusting for more men than it otherwise would not be great. Maybe men should not be excited by what dominates the film industry, but is it the answer for women to do the same? Maybe, if you do not like movies, television and entertainment with so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, do not look at them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, do not do it. t. Do them. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, someday somebody will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Heck, it seems that some people I like a lot.
