I bought this DVD for my little son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected him to be in the same league as in the Toystory films, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, way below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is not original, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is below average, even Buzz is not so good. The movie could have been much better. I especially hated painting by numbers in history. I know it's made for children, but even children know when something stinks at this level of lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the film, I really liked the opening section of the film, with the mutant monster scum, it just went downhill from there.
