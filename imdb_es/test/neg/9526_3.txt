As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other boats, too, I can not see the movie just as a movie. As a movie, some wonderful and wonderful shots of the ship, most of them made on an existing ship, apart from the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under cover. But with respect to the story and the dialogues, I can only call it big shit. None of that would happen like that on a real sailboat. It is not surprising that the film has had a negative impact on the existing ship; If I did not know, I would not be tempted to take a boat trip. Definitely, for Europeans, I recommend turning off once the boat has run aground. After that, the very American part begins, very emotional, which I could not stand. The photos are really, really great, no wonder in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will be much better.
