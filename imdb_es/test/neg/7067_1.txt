. . . and never, never see it. Now, I've been watching bad science fiction movies for years. I love watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason why I could watch this movie all the time. I was hardened by "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and that horrible movie "The Fantastic Four", just to mention some examples. Usually, I have to bang my head against the wall after having seen a bad movie so that the pain disappears. No, not with this one. With "TDB", I had to hit my head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary arrangement I can not believe I wanted to see that. I cried. When it was over, I cried. It was horrible. It was worse than when I saw * shudders * Wil Wheaton in his underwear in "The Curse", which, by the way, does not look either. Apart from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his whitish white, it's so bad. But this revision is about "TDB". Worst of all, someone wrote this movie and said: "This deserves to be in a movie! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "Oh, this is what I want in my movie history!" I'll see "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I'll never see this pile of smoking children again.
