It's not as bad as "Billy Bathgate" but it's close. As much as he could, Warren Beatty simply could not be believed as Bugsy. Every time he turned around, instead of being scandalized by the violence, he found it quite embarrassing because it was very false. The other actors are not doing so well either. Annette Bening simply does not have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more credible George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel was unharmed, but again this guy can make these movies while he sleeps. And Robert Beltran, with only one line, steals one of Beatty's great scenes, Bening. With these films, I'm never sure if the director intends to make mobsters look like normal businessmen or that they are. Either way, I do not like it. These guys were murderers and no matter how much I'm in Las Vegas debt with Bugsy Siegel, I do not think we should make a movie that glorifies the boy, especially one with great studio support.
