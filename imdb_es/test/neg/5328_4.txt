I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I am 24 years old, I saw him again and wished I had not. Because all the things that I laughed at when I was younger are no longer fun. So this is an hour and a half without fun. To me, the jokes were unconvincing, neither funny nor too childish. So the same thing that I liked about the movie when I was a kid, now is what I do not like about it. Besides not being fun, it's not really believable at all. The evil character is very badly done, but I guess that's the kind of movie he is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty boring, with bad fight sequences, etc. But if you're young, you'll probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10
