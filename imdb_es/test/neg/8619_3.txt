Even though this was set to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swords, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have aspired beyond that. Because he does not even aspire to be a good vampire movie, VTT does not manage to give any blow he could have tried. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story about the progeny that she created by mistake (and now must disappear) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his plight in " Gremlins, "and that's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire movie. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but lacks accent when you realize she is an 800-year-old vampire. Besides that, when she tells Connor that he is "a young soul," she does not offer the line with much of the weight that one would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive, but not credible. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in her role but, for a Dawson's Creek student, you would think she would have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you will never get it. You get an opportunity, but in reality you never get any kind of character development for that plot device. It's a cheap way to play your audience, friends. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find Lugosi's "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of Hammer movies with much more power than this one. In the end, if you want something good or sexy, this is not the place. This is simply forgettable.
