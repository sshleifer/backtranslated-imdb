I consider myself to have a good sense of humor, but this "movie" left me dazed in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad it could not have been worse. Not once did I laugh at the sad attempts at jokes in this movie. I have seen and enjoyed several parodies of great movies, but unfortunately this will always be the one I remember best: in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason someone should want to see this is if they want to go into a coma for a short period of time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie in history.
