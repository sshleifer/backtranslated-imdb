A family of land farmers moves west. <br /> <br /> The head of the new variegated breeding of Walnut Grove is called 'Charles'. He works at the sawmill sawing a lot of wood, but for the hell he thinks he is cutting all that wood is a mystery, because none of the people in the entire municipality has enough money to buy a splinter, let alone two percent. four. <br /> <br /> Run the city are the 'Olsons', a rich but stupid clan that moved to these parts to gather all the mass they do selling eggs for eleven cents per dozen. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie', and a girl, 'Nellie', who among them have only one savings asset ... Nellie is sexy and it's fun to spy on her when she bathes in the bathroom. . <br /> <br /> The city preacher is also the village idiot because he thinks it really is something special for this group of peasants who live in the countryside, when in reality they can not stand their boring sermons and the only thing They pray. because Sunday is for him to fall off the nearest cliff as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The city doctor is a dinosaur who saw his best days some 20 years ago, but he keeps going around to give free breast exams to the old witches who live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these old hot moms kneel is to take a loaf of bread out of the oven to give it to the Doc for their services. But that's fine with Doc because he knows these old girls give good bread. <br /> <br /> Bringing the back of this colorful collection of cow's potatoes from the country is Charles' 'caring wife' and his three daughters' Mary ',' Carrie 'and' Half-Pint '. Mary is another hot girl that all the guys take a look at each time she takes a shower or shit. Carrie is an annoying little girl, but she puts a cookie in her mouth and you will not even know she's there, in fact, where is she? ... oh, there she is ... she is in the yard playing with a pack of cigarettes ... how cute! Half-Pint is the youngest disaster in the city. He may not have a brain or some kind of body to talk about, but he can spit more than any child in the whole damn school. <br /> <br /> It's a big city, Walnut Grove, where there's always someone. falling from a roof or being run over by a wagon wheel, and it's beautiful, too, made up of a building ... the church / school / town house / billiard room. Oh, it gets a little hairy in the meadow, but it's okay, especially when Mary is taking a bath in the bathroom ... that's when you can see how hairy she is.
