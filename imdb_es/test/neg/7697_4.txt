I saw this short film on the DVD for Ridley Scott's movie, The Duellists. Before the movie, Scott had not made a presentation, it just started. <br /> <br /> Boy and a Bicycle is not an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it has no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, riding a bicycle. Guess what? That's pretty much everything that happens. The child walks around, wandering again and again with a confusing and meaningless dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and as directed by Ridley Scott, I expected great cinematography or visually stunning scenes. Instead, they treated me with nothing. This movie is not even good for a first effort. However, I recommend that any Ridley Scott fan review it at least once.
