Probably the biggest thing about the Wild Rebels that hurts the most is the hero. He has a LOSER written about him, but that does not stop him from "catching the girl". Probably, one of the worst riders in the world imaginable, he decides to stop running after his car crashes. Well, his new job is still a race, since a group of motorcyclists select him to drive his escape car while committing crimes. There's really nothing to fall in love with Rod, even the situation he's seen is pretty stupid. At the end, in the lighthouse scene, you'll want them to kill Rod with all the bikers. He understands this: he was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and still manages to climb the stairs a little. If only Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you're watching the MST3K version.
