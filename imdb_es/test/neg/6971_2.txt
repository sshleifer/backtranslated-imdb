I saw Ed Wood's biopic many years ago. Tim Burton made a loving tribute to this filmmaker without talent but with a lot of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it really tickled me to the end. A silly story, a kind of bad production values, but still entertaining and even fun. <br /> <br /> Then this. What can you do with that? Well, since it's been reported that Wood is a transvestite, it's amazing to see a movie about that as a caricature. Yes, there are some attempts to teach the audience something about the subject, but it is mostly a kind of twisted self-parody. One of his problems is that he has a hundred points of view. On the one hand it is a request for tolerance. Another portrays transvestism as a disease. And finally, he tells the audience: "Okay, if you're surprised now, wait to see this!" The problem must have been that Wood had to compromise to make the film. You can almost feel it when you see the initial title of the producer: Supervised personally by ... So, where are we? This is neither a serious movie nor a gossip. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is practically nil. The voice-over of wood is slightly funny, but only because it sounds very bad. However, this was done in the 50s, so it can be argued that it was brave to make a movie that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to defend. Schock The rape scene, although gentle, is there simply to do that. <br /> <br /> So, I'm sorry. This is a misfire, but the discredit is not just Wood's.
