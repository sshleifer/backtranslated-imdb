Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me get to the point. <br /> <br /> Forced frivolity. Miscastantes who work hard to have fun and thus have fun. The bright Meryl Streep gives him a great try. Pierce Brosnan simply embarrassing. Inexplicably set in a Greek island. Many women screaming and screaming. Much. <br /> <br /> It was a silly Juke Box musical on stage, now it's a big screen Juke Box musical, splashed, badly shot. If you like ABBA, regulate. If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to the intelligence that you have left when you leave the theater. I admit that I did not want to see this movie and I went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my genre scream and scream to convey pleasure? Have you ever sat next to a table of women who have drunk too much and are absolutely determined to have a GREAT night in the city? That is the feeling of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.
