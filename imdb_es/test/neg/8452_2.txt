This is an example of a movie that may have great potential and is very poorly executed. I am a fan of children and thumb suckers and many other movies called Teen Angst, but this bothered me. <br /> <br /> Why do all white children become a bully who loves rap? It is becoming one dimensional. the acting was horrible but simple, since it consisted mainly in releasing f bomb after f pump alone in a bad bad movie if you would like to see better movies like this: the thumb suckers intimidate all those <br /> <br /> those i I think they are better, so I recommend one of those. He would like to see a good "movie for teenagers". I hope that my comment has been useful and I hope you will hear future comments from me.
