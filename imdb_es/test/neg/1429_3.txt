Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Peña, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider, Amal Rhoe. The disturbing scenes of torture "highlight" this dark and disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath who attracts teenagers to his torture chamber through the Internet. Snider (from the rock band of the 80s, Twisted Sister) plays the putrid psychopath, which is a dirty "twist" (no pun) in Hannibal Lecter. Peña is wasted as one of the mothers of the victims. Harrelson (brother of Woody) offers one of the worst performances of cops I've seen in a movie, and Rhoe shows why this is his only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. The soundtrack of heavy metal is, ultimately, numb, the scenes of torture very graphic and rude, and the end just sucks. GRADE: 3 of 10. R rating for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
