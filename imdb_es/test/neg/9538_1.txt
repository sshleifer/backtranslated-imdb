Well, let's say that some university in Southern California has a film class. And some guys signed up just to film the girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / drugged / or just stupid for using a camera, and they delivered this for their grade. AND FAILED. <br /> <br /> That's my only explanation for this, this, thing. My God, they left the date and time counter for part of it. The image began in a new scene before the sound, and forget about a plot. Well, apparently there was one and they had to tell everything once the 3-hour introduction sequence was completed. But I'm glad they did it because I never would have gotten it by seeing this. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this.
