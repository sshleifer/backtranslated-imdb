Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and false. She is the same on and off the screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly like in the movies. Their silly facial expressions make me want to change the channel. She has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better if they had chosen someone else for the role. Steve Martin does not add much to the movie either. Acts also and ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part played by Martin Short only adds more idiocy to the movie. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both times I had to turn it off.
