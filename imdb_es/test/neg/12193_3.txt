What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently seems like a boring director ... there were so many directions that the film could have taken ... a vampire bar festival was not one of these !!! The last 45 minutes. or that results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ... and the sexual machine? ... You got to be kidding! The acting talents of people like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted on this pointless film. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody films that include the mariachi, desperate, sometime in Mexico, and the very recent city of sin ... really catches your eye with the first half is well executed ... which leads you to believe that an entertaining moment awaits you ... but apparently without any reason, and without any provocation, the madness begins ... there are even weak attempts at parody and comedy . .. really exasperating !!
