I assumed that this was the duo of cat and mouse, but it was not, but it was something that should not have been done at the moment. They disguise themselves in the manner of a "black face" because they fly to Africa and even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others come together. There are some cartoons that are racist, but they are classic, being a mixed woman, I have the right to say this, but if you like the historical aspect of these cartoons, try Merrie Melodies "Coal Black and Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss" You will not find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to include them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a site like YouTube. I do not recommend young children to see this, but if they want to see how the United States was racist and ignorant, these are better suggestions, not to mention that this particular cartoon has little animation, I know it was in 1932, but I have seen better by Your Time <br /> <br /> "Plane" unnecessary. -1 of 10.
