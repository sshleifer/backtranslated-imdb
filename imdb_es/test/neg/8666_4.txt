The 1999 adaptation of Rozema by Mansfield Park is far superior to this seemingly slightly more faithful film. The 1999 movie is vilified by many Austen purists, but I admire Rozema's work in making Mansfield Park his own. It may not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, well filmed and well performed by a top cast. I do not see how Austen purists can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and retransmission in Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The script is grudgingly stuck and piled up to boot, the production values ​​are mediocre and the cast (apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely to blame for bad acting. I can not think of a worse disaster than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. His appearance was totally wrong (bleached hair and dark eyebrows) and his talent simply was not suitable for the material. Sir Thomas seemed constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot, as were the actors who played the Crawfords (when I think that Superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shake my head). <br /> <br /> I have not seen the 1983 version, so I can not comment on it, but I would recommend anyone who is curious to give the '99 version a try. Read the novel sooner or later and make up your mind.
