I knew I was not about to watch a quality movie when this title was included in a "B-grade video night" at a friends' place. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that there are many of us who share the pain between us ... The film tries to tell the story of a dark future, in which Hawk (a type of Mad Max character) goes to rescue a damsel in distress. In fact, the plot is a very little disguised excuse for producers to promote their own philosophies of life (see the final credits and the disclaimer "these people are not real" in the end for a real laugh). The film often lacks direction and fails to develop its characters in any degree. What is even worse is the editing of this movie. The film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds in length) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to emulate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's fight sequences, but if it is, it totally fails. The movie would probably have about a third of its duration if we were not forced to see the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). I give this movie my prize for "the worst movie I've ever seen". I doubt that it will be overcome in the short term.
