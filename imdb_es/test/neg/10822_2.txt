A mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and travel another 2.4 miles underwater to an even more remote place, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some large and sharp. Winged, computer-generated creatures lurking. The cave is sealed by a rockfall and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone while looking for a way out. And that's all he wrote with this low-aim effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror at the most elementary levels. Imagine if someone gave the people of the Science Fiction Channel 30 million dollars to make a monster movie. This is precisely how THE CAVE is; Almost surprising in its ineptitude at times, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on special effects to entertain. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money to polish the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who, anyway, give horrible performances. Otherwise, it's business as usual. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This one is not and there are a lot of reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) He takes himself too seriously and has no sense of humor at all. So you get a completely original and predictable movie that does not even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence is good for nothing but killing a few minutes and increasing redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) CGI creatures of non-original appearance do not impress anyone in this day and age <br /> <br /> 4.) The use of shakycam and fast-cut editing for their Horror scenes is simply a lazy and unimaginative film making. And why darken the action even more by making things too dark And adding distracting distractions, such as fire and bubble burst? It makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to enjoy even at an uncomplicated level of action. <br /> <br /> 5.) Although you want to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is horrible and there is no attempt at characterization. The casting of models of 25-year-old models with roles as brilliant scientists and gross and experienced explorers can provide a bit of visual appeal, but completely kills the credibility of a film that, otherwise, develops completely directly . Sorry, you can not have both. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule, as they decided to choose an older man and an average-looking Joe. These were the first two characters killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a bit of diversity, they also squeezed into a black man and a Chinese man. Interestingly, neither of them is given much of a voice in this film and, basically, they stand out in the background while Whitey discusses what his next move will be. Insulting. <br /> <br /> 8.) Also, how many films should be made when a black character sacrifices his life at the end just to ensure that Hot White Female Lead and Hot White Male Lead end up together at the end? Ugh Give me a break now. <br /> <br /> 9.) Much of the performance was HORRIBLE. The performance of Cole Hauser was completely laughable. The other male protagonist seemed to simply leave the stage of a soap opera and slipped using the patented technique of dimpled smile dimples, which is the gender-changing equivalent of PG-13 to my- The technique of large breasts makes All the boys faint, often used by women in the R-rated movies. Either way, their performance was completely telephoned. Daniel Dae Kim (from the television series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also stunk the room with his monotonous and stilted line of work. The end of a joke? Absolutely terrible. Please, God, we do not need a sequel to this garbage. <br /> <br /> So basically I would not bother with this, unless you've never seen a monster movie or if you're just desperate. and the only other thing is "The simple life". The scenarios were good, the blue photography is fine and some of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) did their best, so I decided to increase the rating from one level to a "2".
