You will feel that you have experienced a vacation in hell after you sit down and watch this horrible television movie. This movie is an exercise in overexcitement (very bad overacting) in situations that seem to be more than they are. I will not reveal the plot, but once you realize why the people in this movie are fleeing from the native man in the movie, you will demand the two lost hours of your life. The only advantage is seeing Marcia Brady running in a bikini!
