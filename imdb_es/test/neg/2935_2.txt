Well, where do you begin to describe this celluloid debacle? You already know that the great NOTHING happens like a plot, so we're going to point out that this is so PC that it's offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who caused us riots of laughter like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this disaster without grace. <br /> <br /> So, this guy does not know he's gay until this actor points. outside. Clear. If someone ever says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even if I currently like girls more than George Luca $ likes a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how to know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dancing and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half of my shirt hanging), I'm straight. Oh sure. <br /> <br /> And here's the big cliché of clichés: no matter how you look at it, there's always a very attractive Hollywood actor who will adore all the grease under his skin, or a superior model who will love your zero IQ, your ugly face and your ears pointing out. If all those gay platitudes were not enough to make me angry, this he did. In the real world things seem important, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: now you will say "Relax! It's a comedy! Do not take it so seriously!" If being a comedy gives something "carte blanche" to suck, I think the world has a serious problem. Would not it be much better (and funnier) to make a film to deny those old exhausting clichés, instead of magnifying them over and over again? <br /> <br /> Then, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. seen 1 of 10. If this rating has anything to do with my sexual orientation, let me know. I'm interested.
