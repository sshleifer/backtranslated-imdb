If it is true that the film only costs 150 K to make it, it is explained a lot. But, it does not explain why it does not have a real plot. Halfway through the movie, I honestly did not care if they came out or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The ending was really silly and made me want to wish I had turned off the movie and slept early. Pretty good acting considering that there was not much to go. If you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave) and bad camera work (even for a cave) ... then you will really like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old, how could he have forgotten how to talk and accumulate so much anger? Would not he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen, even if it had been 14 years?
