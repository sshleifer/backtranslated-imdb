I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I had heard about the film forever, from several people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. Then, for several years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found him sitting alone in the local video store, just wanting to rent it. So, being the movie buff that I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a chance. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is too long, boring, badly acted, miserable shot - And that's just the good. I tried to make it as difficult as possible, which included removing my brain and putting it on the table so it would not interfere with the horrible story. Unfortunately, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad that it is pathetic. And the very idea that they're planning a sequel makes me believe that the director and his henchmen have not heard any of the criticisms I'm sure they've heard. Go ahead, guys. Please. In fact, refrain from making movies together. Or attend some classes on rhythm, narration and, well, basic direction. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, for the love of God, hang it.
