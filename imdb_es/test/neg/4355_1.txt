The quality you'll probably remember after seeing The Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. Its rhythm is sacrificed to a uniform texture of dialogue. It's talky at the end. Modern viewers will feel that all points have been made (and some), but the film will not advance yet, or it will do the viewer a favor and change the scenario. It is very inert. At 45 minutes I was sure I had seen two very slow hours. My besieged response was: "Holy God, where is this going?" It seems that Odets paid the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to observe the decline of the drama from its peak in the 40s to the deceptive projects of the 50s and 60s the real filmic merit was rediscovered in the 70s, only to disappear again. Here we get emotional outbursts, conventional, Steiger, Lupino et al. and the camera moves in advance to comply with the blockade practiced. This is due to the appearance of the Method; the unfortunate tendency to sacrifice all the other merits of the film, to grant the actors their most selfish desires. "Good acting", ho-hum, has killed the thought in the movies. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's brow and forearm recede and push forward every time he reacts to something. It is disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is something very boring.
