Another movie with a wrestling star. So far I've realized ... the fighters can not act on the movie screen. This movie is not an exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh for what they say, and they can not be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and they look stupid. The acting is horrible, possibly because of the bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid ... Only some people are placed in a hotel because they are criminals and are murdered at random. The movie is stupid in every way, so it's one of the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I think about is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The stick in the head and the stories of him falling were incredible. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a really horrible movie, and you definitely should not waste your time with it.
