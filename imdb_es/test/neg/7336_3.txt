First, let me mention the fact that, despite its title ("Historias," in the plural), there is only ONE cooking story. As for whether Isak died or not at the end, I'm not so sure since, in one of the last scenes, you see YOUR PIPE on the table next to the two glasses. On the cover of the DVD, there is a reference to Tati. He states that the film is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: remember Tati!") The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on silent and silent attitudes to achieve his comic effects and offer his points of view critically satirical of his French "modern" society of the 1950s. Of course, the "kitchen" takes place during the 1950s and offers some satirical (rather weak) references to the absurdities of the bureaucracy and there are some long moments in the that they do not pronounce words, but they are not really fun, are all these little details enough to make "Kitchen" a "tatty" movie? That said, I must admit that "Kitchen" deals with the sometimes false objectivity of the scientific research versus the "truth" of human subjective emotions In general terms, the film was agonizingly slow, with nothing happening, almost without any "dramatic impulse": the parts in volucradas were created during the first 15 minutes approximately, and during the last minutes. Yes of one hour or so. In fact, the last segment was - FINALLY! - Interesting and moving. It might seem like it was a short topic, less than an hour long, overly extended to about 90 minutes. Now, about the configuration (a "scientific" observation about the behavior of single men in your kitchen): at first it looked very promising - with the record of the coming and going of singles in your kitchen as a means to determine what New inventions would be more useful to get to. But very soon, this premise turned out to be only a prologue, an "excuse" to present the real theme that developed completely towards the end and that dealt with loneliness and the inestimable bond of friendship. Pity! I honestly wanted to like that movie. Yes, I found it very promising when I found out about some of your unusual little "anecdotes" that were actually there and enjoyed, like the burning in the hair of a man's nose (instead of using scissors to cut it) ). the "inversion" of having a large amount of "valuable" black pepper piled up in a barn, reversals of roles (the observer becomes the observed), the mouth of a man who emits sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse that is becoming the catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of driving with the right or left side in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance of each of these neighboring countries very close to affirm your individuality?). Am I the only person who did not fully enjoy that movie? Does this necessarily mean that I am wrong? Perhaps it is almost generally praised that "fine points" are, in fact, "too subtle" for me. Perhaps ... Could my individual views on this film ironically reflect the very essence of the film? What would be the vital need to have the right to differ, affirm one's individuality and not blindly follow the tendencies and opinions of society? Each of us has the right to have different personal points of view and not be a slave to the demands of the "dictatorial" winning demands of bread: often, we have other alternatives that would allow us to be useful for our society, respecting the internal principles . In short, be honest with yourself, the way Folke (the "scientific observer" of Isak) ends up giving up his work and prefers to stay at the house of his new friend Isak and help him in the tasks of his farm. ... And so, «Live the Difference», as the French say!
