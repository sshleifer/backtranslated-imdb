I'll leave it to my gamblers, ehh, the best ones here so that they are left speechless and open-mouthed at this wonderful and wonderful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The best thing about this site is that you always get a variety of views and look for them, by all means. Do not say with what you will come out of the movie. For me, those who saw through simplicity and scams have my money. There was one, dead in perfect when he pointed out the two great moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Apart from that, well, what a waste of time. Absolutely. Pacino is simply doing the same thing over and over again, he would have been better served by reducing performance by about five levels at the level of his protégé. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been much better. Of course, everyone could have been. But in reality most of them should never have been done. Including this.
