After the inflection point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (most of the time) entered his best films and performances: HERE COME MR. JORDAN, They were affordable, THE LADY ON THE LAKE, RIDES THE PINK HORSE, THE CHARM OF THE SAXON, THE JUNIOR GIRLFRIEND. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to remain observable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR., AND MRS SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. In 1949 he made what would be his last film performance: played Collier Lang, a selfish movie star, who is dragged to help the authorities to investigate the boyfriend of a girl. <br /> <br /> Apparently, my opinion of This movie is a minority view. Most of the points of view given are favorable in this regard. I thought it was a boring and witty script, with the groupie heroine of Ann Blyth not very attractive as a character. She admires Montgomery like a star, and this "helps" when they call him to help the authorities, but after a while I discovered there was no chemistry between them. The script also did not have much fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried it. The only thing I remember from this day as a joke is that Taylor Holmes is the rich father of Blyth, and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses like Churchill, and we see him with a wide-brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps disguise). That was the most memorable joke in this movie, not a great real memory. <br /> <br /> Montgomery entered early television, and finally gained the attention and respect he had always deserved in the movies. His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS on Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better movie than this one. For your general career in film and television, I will give this mediocre movie a "4". That seems generous to me.
