Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (elegant term for one of those losers who cheat themselves and likes to study extremely rare animals, read: nonexistent) and his team of hunters manage to catch a Chupacabra Large, scaly, elusive and fast-moving beast. To take it to the continent, they smuggle it on a Grecian cruise ship and some idiots open the box that contains it even though they have been specifically told not to do so. I guess the strange grunts that came from the interior were not a good enough deterrent either. The monster then makes the monster thang; scampering biting chunks of several passengers until the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a special square-jawed agent who pretends to be an insurance salesman for some reason (Dylan Neal), a voice-shrieking blond Tai Bo instructor ( Chelan Simmons), a group of guys with machine guns and others try to stop him. The main victims (which I think are supposed to be comic relief, but hard to say) are a rich old bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a gold digger (David Millbern). Apparently, the monster can be eliminated with a single tranquilizing dart, but can survive through dozens of bullets. Chupacabra's design is acceptable (although not original) but the rest of the film lacks suspense, surprise or interest. A boring Sci-Fi Channel "original" movie; They have made dozens of movies like this one with characters and arguments that are almost interchangeable, but with slight alterations in the creature. Enough is enough!
