This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen. The plot could have been made work, if the movie had been better written. The performance was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and I wanted to leave / turn off the movie several times. I saw the whole movie with the hope that the ending was worth it, but it did not. This film I think should be classified in the negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
