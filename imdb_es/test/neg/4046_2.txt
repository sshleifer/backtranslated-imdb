This movie was so horrible that I could not get through the whole thing without turning it off, it was so bad! When I was watching it, I kept thinking it looked like a really cheap movie made in the '60s or something like that with terrible-looking special effects, but then I realized that this had been done in 2001. <br /> <br / > The dialogue and acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost nonexistent. I did not think anyone would ever make movies that looked so cheap and old, I'm not sure if they did it on purpose or if they really did not have any budget for this movie. It really looks like it was filmed on someone's video camera in the home of a local person or something. Maybe they thought they were being retro or something, but it just looks very corny. <br /> <br /> I really do not know how anyone could enjoy watching this. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 * 's.
