This is another alien imitation and not very good. Replace the outer space with the South African desert, add the same ingredients, a group of people trapped in an inhospitable landscape, make an alien creature chase them and you The same old story from a very common movie that tries to imitate a classic movie . A group of miners and scientists are going to hunt down some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert clean of meat. Your vehicle breaks down and you are heading to civilization while being harassed by the monster. The location in Africa is quite beautiful, but that is basically all that this film has in its favor. There is a vain attempt to increase the tension, but I found that this did not really work and I made the movie quite boring. The creature did not look like much and when it did it did not set up a sense of horror. a scene in which someone gets the flesh torn off his arm, but that was basically on the blood front. In conclusion, I found this film as exciting as seeing the painting in its tracks. I give this film 4/10 and that's just for the interesting place that alone is not enough to prevent this film from being a festival of total repetition
