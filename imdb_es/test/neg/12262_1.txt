This movie could have been great, but it was not. Between the pit of the no-hopers without talent and the friends of the filmmakers who wanted to help, there are some signs of talent. The main star of the film plays a good leading role. It is convincing and has those fearsome Italian eyes. However, it is linked to the worst rejections of actors that anyone has ever known. The initial scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. He looks like Gay Porn. Fortunately nobody got undressed. The scene of the violation that is still mentioned is garbage. The prison sequence was the best part of the film, although irrelevant. The soundtrack of the movies (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenager's first attempt to use coolit and some sample CDs. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact the whole movie is lame. Get out while you can!
