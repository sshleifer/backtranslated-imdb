This film is supposed to be about the frustrations of making movies. It certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom. The stage is an attractive Spanish spa with its usual great cast. The script is very badly written or maybe there was no script. Just all ad-lib. <br /> <br /> A far superior film about the frustrations of filmmaking is the "Day For Night" by Francois Truffaut, made in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast can behave badly in an intriguing way . Do not bore the viewer and get sympathy for the director who, in some way, must complete the film.
