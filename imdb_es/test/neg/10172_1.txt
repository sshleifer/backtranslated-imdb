This movie was the biggest piece of trash I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is marketed as science fiction when in fact it is nothing more than a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you a lot about the state of the Christian church, when you have to resort to deception just so you can listen to your sales pitch. But again, what do you expect from an organization that does everything possible to help protect such a huge number of child molesters in your organization. and war traders. Let's not forget, our clumsy former president came out and said "God told him" to invade Iraq. And nobody asked if he heard voices or saw things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's go on the topic here. No, this movie has nothing to do with UFOs at all, it's nothing more than a religious production.
