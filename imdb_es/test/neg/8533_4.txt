This film has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few films can really give me the creeps. This he did. Few horror movies give me a sense of fear. This he did. He kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I worried about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, in the middle of the movie, the story simply does not have many good directions that I can follow. It becomes clear that everything good in the plot will self-destruct. He does it. What is built in the first half when a great concept of horror moves away from horror and goes towards the absurd. A plausible fear becomes a series of implausible reactions of the characters. The story concludes with disappointment. While this movie seems complete, there is a loose end that could be set up for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a sequel. It is worth watching this movie in the theater, but do not expect to be surprised. This is more suitable as a movie to rent. It's probably not a movie you want to have.
