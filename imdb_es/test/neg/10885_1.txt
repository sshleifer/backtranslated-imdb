The only good thing about this movie is that now I have a movie on the worst list in history. Rest Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the terrible movies. Actually, this movie is the worst plot, the worst directed, throughout the whole movie all I wanted to do was pull my hair out and kick the writer and anyone who made the ass of this movie possible. I am a soldier deployed, and when I spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. These people should feel terrible, they had to see this before it came out, and they should have been driving the lazy people crazy to redo them, after they realized they were being sucked. I am so surprised that this great country of ours allows you to do another. Honestly, this is the first time I comment on a movie, I have to warn the world, not waste time. Remove this movie from the face of this planet. It makes us look like retarded humans.
