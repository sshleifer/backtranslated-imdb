I watch a lot of movies and enjoy the occasional B movie, but this movie was horrible. Apart from the "homemade" quality of the film, it was very slow and seemed to make no sense. I'm just commenting b / c on another comment I saw here that said it was great! WOOHOO! Maybe it's good to see it on a rainy day when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were disjointed and did not fit any discernible pattern of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and, at times, very confusing. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you were very interested in Area 51 and you understood some of the nuances that other comments refer to, it may be good, but for me ... The average Joe, do not I understand it? ?
