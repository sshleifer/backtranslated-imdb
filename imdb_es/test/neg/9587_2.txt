... why watch a television drama (considered as a comedy) in which none of the characters is nice or even interesting people? I can see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the bad directions and the bad taste surprises that he put in "A foot in the grave", etc. I admit that the script did a little more effort than most. On British television at this time. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold holes. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of her and her late ex boyfriend, fucking. That was the moment when I turned off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, while those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC aired this series it was ignored by the viewers and sank like a rock. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! There will be a second series in the fall of 2007, although without the male protagonist. It seems that the BBC has decided to make it into a more conventional 30-minute comedy.
