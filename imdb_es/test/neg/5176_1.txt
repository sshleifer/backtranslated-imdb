This is possibly the worst cockney gangster genre that has ruined the British film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie unleashed the actions of Lock and two badly operated barrels.

"The performance is uniformly terrible, since the two most recognizable cast members are two soap opera stars quite visible from their depth.For some reason, in the movie we're supposed to have heard about these people and I can assure you that no one north of Essex has not done it, and that we should be interested in some low life story, why, this is not Goodfellas despite the propaganda on the cover of the DVD. in a football hooligan turned into a gangster turned gangster to whom friends end up being shot ... Boo Hoo The fact that these people are totally unfriendly is the only small advantage of this movie. action, it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and turned, while people pretended to fight and the story of someone that most people had never heard and that nothing really interesting is also a complete waste of time .
