It became evident in the first 25 minutes of seeing this that the writers really wanted to make a feature film and probably enjoyed the whole process, but then they seemed to forget the fact that they needed a decent argument! If the best they could do was for 3 of the most boring characters to enter the real world and have "all kinds of funny capers," then they should have been fine on their own! I did not laugh once, and all that "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" happening in the middle was very, very poor! Convaluados, devised and very loose. It just seemed like a whistle stop tour of everything that they thought would "work" just to lengthen it into a function. <br /> <br /> Full of holes, for example: the characters of Royston Vasey needed writers to continue writing. to save them, even so, Jeff managed to write himself in the secondary story / time that filled William and Mary and the era. If he could do this, why did not they keep writing to Royston themselves, duh? And the hearing of Herr Lipp? What was that for? I mean what was the point? He did it, and did not we hear anything else about that? <br /> <br /> My main point is that, although I loved the series, this was a badly planned and apparently hasty project. Put in this way, the plot was so bad that if we did not know the characters (and as a fanatic I had some loyalty to keep watching), and we rely solely on the story itself, this would have fallen. flat on your face! In the best case, it would have gone directly to the video, and in the worst case, it would never have been done in the first place! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Really terrible ...
