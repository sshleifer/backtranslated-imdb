With all its technical prowess, the 1993 film "Stalingrad" is very disappointing. Before seeing him, he had read non-fiction stories from the Stalingrad campaign and had seen many documentary images and photographs of the actual battle and its participants. I do not think any film can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that really happened, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German film production would be like. While there are some good elements of this movie, in general it is a failure. For me, the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very suitable elements and cliché, most notably in some meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements in the film that result in highly distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a German chaplain, some exaggerated messages of class warfare and problematic representations of "good" Germans. against "bad guys" Certainly, the German Armed Forces of World War II included men who could maintain a certain decency during the war and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I credit "Stalingrad" in the sense that it does not completely represent the German troops in the simple demonic quality, which is the stereotype that many people have now; however, the film includes its own stereotypes, as an example too good. the infantryman to be true who has attitudes more similar to the 1990s than to the 1940s, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rearguard officer. <br /> <br /> Some recent films like "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" are frequently praised for their "authenticity" in depicting graphic combat scenes, however, these same films are deeply flawed and distorted in their descriptions of the attitudes, values ​​and behaviors of the soldiers and civilians of 1940. "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have major and minor characters that lack the unconscious stoicism that was common among ordinary people during the period of the Second World War. Certainly, soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grunts and occasional cynicism, however, the self-absorbed, talented and sensitive characters of these two films are something else, and they are much more frequent in our world today than in our current world. the 1940s. While many people these days like to denigrate the war films of the 40s and 50s that present more patriotic messages and are not as graphic about combat, many of those earlier films such as "Battlefield "They are much more accurate in their descriptions of typical soldiers." Attitudes, and often succeed in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways. <br /> <br /> A well-made part of "Stalingrad" is a battle between the German infantry and the Soviet tanks, which makes a reasonable effort.The work of capturing part of the horror and confusion in such a battle. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a bad job, although it shows the common aspect of the front-line soldier - part of this could be due to the difficulty of finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed America and today's Western Europe. Manas in the film do not wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and they do not show the professional course that was common in the German Wehrmacht even during the years of the German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of ​​what the German troops looked like, I recommend the following documentaries that contain images of the Stalingrad campaign: "The World at War", "War of the Century" and "War of Russia". Also the books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrad" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell contain many useful photos. Books written about the battle by Antony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter is especially good with soldiers and common civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent films that, in my opinion, are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" by portraying the attitudes and characters of people during World War II, and the feeling In general, the appearance, horror and gravity of that war are "Der Untergang" ("The Downfall") and "Talvisota" ("The Winter War"). While "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Longest Day" cover events on the Western Front rather than in the East, they are also excellent war movies and closely resemble the facts. The last two films lack something of the importance that prevails in the most recent films, but make up for that lack with their other strengths, including truthfulness.
