Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent horror movie of the '80s. It's not a classic in any way, but a nice piece of fluff. So, why have we now been treated to a fourth movie in this franchise? As in the previous sequels, here is nothing that really connects the movies, except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we followed the enmity between the Hatfields and the McCoys. Part of the film is a romance between Romeo and Juliet when a young McCoy and his lover from Hatfield decide to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are destroyed and the child's sister is killed. The boy escapes to the forest and gets the witch to resuscitate Pumpkinhead to take revenge. The performance is passable in the best case, amateur at worst. The titular demon does not even appear for almost forty minutes and when it does it is a pale comparison between it and the original design. In general, Blood Feud does not impress. It may be worth a watch once, but it certainly is not an addition to the collection.
