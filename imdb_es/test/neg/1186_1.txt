very disappointing and incoherent - from time to time a germ of an idea would develop and be discarded in the next line - had the feeling of a movie that had been cut and cropped to try to make it work. I got bored and distracted all the time, and I'm talking like a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were not original and they were tired. The medieval section lasted too long and the quality of the performance was very bad, some in the small places invited, as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham did more in their 30 seconds assigned than in the main cast. I did it in 90 Min. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, really. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to take a look inside the small shed in Soho Square, which is something that all of us who are never in that part of London wonder about.
