The problem with this film is that it is not funny, it is not scary, it is not dramatic, it is not intriguing, it is not stimulating, it is not, it is not exciting, it is not. Not even the most interesting. I saw this movie recently on a tape and I was glad I did not spend money to rent it. It's basically a poor attempt to make movies. I will not even bother to tell you the story. History? What history?
