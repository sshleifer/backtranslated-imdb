When a group of dumb children (including an unpleasant racist bitch) stays in an old house, wakes up four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash La Rue save the day? Can you see to the end because of the horrible comedy shown? <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of horror / hybrid comedy that Troma used to throw regularly. The thing is that they did not. release this. That does not justify everything, since it has a dreadful synth score (including bad Native American music attempts and even worse "comedy" music), bad makeup effects (basically Halloween masks) and acting atrocious (Ok, the fat guy was fine, but everyone else is terrible, and La Rue, a veteran of the western movie, seems embarrassed to be there, not really blaming him. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the comedy ... aspects Of course, silly teenagers are one thing, but when the film continues to speak of the Toltec spirits as if they were the supreme evil, only to become horribly annoying and foolish, all hope vanishes. and comedy requires at least some skill.Not shown any skill here, since everything is just stupid, and neither "so silly is fun." I mean "smoking marijuana and listening to bad punk rock I'm not stupid" silly. < br /> <br /> Not even a decent face cheated and a girl with little clothes can save this disaster. Terrible movie, and not even worth renting.
