When writing this review, I have difficulty thinking about what to write. Not much happens in this movie. The story is a woman from South Asia who falls in love with an English-speaking Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends have had a racist streak. At the same time, her friend at work realizes, without knowing it, that she has sex with her brother, and simply intensifies from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all this has happened, everything is pretty standard. It creeps slightly but only lasts about 90 minutes. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're a man, I do not recommend this movie.
