I had been avoiding this movie for some time ... because I saw it as an unnecessary delivery to a series that should have had only 2 parts. But, after reading some fairly favorable reviews ... from some IMDB watchers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. I need to go further ... when I say ... this was a lost buck-50. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I've seen in my life. First of all ... I realize that nobody wanted to see Macchio, 33 years old, in this movie ... But, why could not they have asked Miyagi to read a letter or something from Daniel-san .. maybe explaining? what happened to Daniel ... hell, at least they could have made a quick mention of Daniel or something like that. But, no ... and to compose the already bad script ... they added those stupid monks ... I thought the monks make a vow of silence ... I guess these thieving monks do not take their vows seriously ... hehehe The training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men ... it was a confusing concept to say the least ... this was far from being a martial arts movie. ..with the girl just fighting briefly in the final scene ... and then she was not even close to being beaten even once ... by the man who fights against her ... give me a break ... she would have been hit at least once ... I guess the writers and directors thought it would be a surprise to see a girl being hit by a man in this case. I could go on and on ... but, basically ... I'll end up saying that this movie was so bad ... even that the girl they chose was not even nice to see (it was something like "Butch" watching) ... I can only think of a handful of movies that I've sat in ... that compare to how bad this movie was ... DO NOT "LOSE TIME IN THIS ONE ... ........
