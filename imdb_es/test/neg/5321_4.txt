The 1977 animated live action hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather, 'Travel', since it only reaches Lilliput) did not get a big release, and it's not that hard to see why. Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy melodies, but they simply inspire the lyricist Don Black to the likes of "A simple fact remains / No one here suffers from growing pains". Once again, Richard Harris excels in his passion for excessive makeup, toning the eyeliner for this base in an effort to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old for the role, but at least he (perhaps inappropriately) reduces its tendencies larger than life for a performance composed mainly of condescending whispers. Belgian animation looks a bit better than French children's television in the early morning, but Peter Hunt's film is not as bad as it sounds: the use of real model sets for animated characters can be traced back to the 1939 version of Max and Dave Fleischer, while there remain some moments of Swift's satire, although it is definitely aimed at younger children.
