Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; He must have house payments like me! This low budget movie made in Mexico reminds me of some of those stinking Italians who live in the sea. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because, why else would they make this movie? Surely it was not to make money. We had a lot of these smelly Canadian things, because the government granted tax breaks to create a movie industry. I wonder if it was worth it in other countries like Canada. Anyway, going back to the subject, this movie is badly done in all aspects, I think they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell this stinker; That dead body at the end looks very fake. 3/10
