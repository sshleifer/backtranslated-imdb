I love corny horror movies, I think the vivid and bad taste are great, and I think the massacre of the slumber party II (which is not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely reeked, I did not laugh, I did not even enjoy it ... you can see all kinds of mistakes that are not even comfortable. The best part of the scene in which the woman looks out the window is the one where she bangs her head on the sill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this out thinking it's related to the series of slumber party massacres. It's horrible and I do not even have any idea how it was distributed. Rent it with a false name and open it, please everyone else.
