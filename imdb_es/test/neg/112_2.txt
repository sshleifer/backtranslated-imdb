Now, I love Italian horror movies. The more cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not cheesy Italian. It's a week-old spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. It's amateur time at all levels. There is no suspense, no horror, with only a few scattered drops of blood to remind you that you are actually watching a horror movie. The "special effects" are that the lights change to red each time the ghost (or what it is supposed to be) is around, and a rope that pulls the sheets of the bed up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The quality of the DVD is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the movie rather than hurt it). The dubbing is below even the lowest standards of "bad Italian movie" and I gave it a star just because the dialogue is so much fun! And what do we discover when she finally looks in the attic (in a scene that is from one day and from one night to the next) ... well, I will not spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's say it's not very "new" "!
