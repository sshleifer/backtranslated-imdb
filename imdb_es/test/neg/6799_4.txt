Strange. This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this film is fiction. I guess he tries to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with rarities and made it her main focus of photography. In the movie, Wolfman moves into the apartment over hers. She apparently becomes obsessed with him and falls in love with him. She puts her children and husband in second place over the werewolf, and even tries to incorporate it into their family gatherings. Some of the side kicks of the wolf show come to visit us and she mixes with them. All this is very strange. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There's only something weird about a woman who goes mad when shaving the werewolf. I think you can find better movies out there.
