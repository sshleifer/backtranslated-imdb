This film is an insult to the work on which it is based. Claude's character has been deformed beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame They have also reduced a good number of the original score by changing the context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the air of the film and makes the viewer, who is aware of how it should be, grimace when the writer of this screen work gives Hud a wife, makes Sheila a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kill Burger. sending it to Vietnam instead. If one is not familiar with the original plot, I assure you that this is not a bad movie for you to see, but if you ever want to see the original or is, as I am, a fan of the classic, I would do my best to avoid completely the movie. One must really stick to one or the other.
