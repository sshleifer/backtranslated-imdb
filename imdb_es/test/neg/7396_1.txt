The movie is being televised while I'm writing. <br /> <br /> I just forgot the horrible experience I had when I saw her at the cinema. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is wrong. The fact that Europeans and smart Americans trapped in the desert forget all about morality and civilization in a couple of days is ridiculous. The Madness of the Lord of the Flies was longer in its manufacture. <br /> <br /> The details that bother are many. One is the only African character resembling a god who mysteriously survives the horrible climate and has done so for centuries without losing his head and seems to have no supply problems either. Ridiculous. So is the rescue attempt of the tour guide, a resemblance to Indiana Jones, whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death within 5 minutes walk of the cabin. Then there is Lear's choice, imposed on the group by an artist's joke about a guru. It reminded me of my high school hippy art teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that Levrings chose Lear. Obviously he is an intellectual brain-fart. The way this was going to be a time of passage is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> The positive aspects are few and far between. It's a beautiful movie, but that's never important. <br /> <br /> The intellectualism of the secondary school. Strange for the good of stranger. It's a complete waste of time unless you like to roll up useless art movies.
