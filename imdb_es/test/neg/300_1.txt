Jefferey Dahmer was a sick guy. There's not much to say about him that has not been said, except that the many documentaries and movies made about him are probably better than this one. It's ridiculously corny. It's very corny, a guy who posted the entire movie on YouTube added some notes to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (Who is he?) Performs the serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, Who's kill kill spree began in 1978 with a young boy with whom Dahmer just wanted to be friends, and finally in 1991 with a man with whom I wanted to have sex and eat. <br /> <br /> I did not bother watching the whole movie. It is basically a documentary that shows all the attacks that Dahmer made before he was caught. And since this movie was made in 1993, a year before a fellow prisoner beat Dahmer to death, Dahmer's death is not shown. but it probably would have been as cheesy as this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
