I think "category 6: day of destruction" was very unrealistic. The digital effects were like a childish caricature. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically, for example, when they shot the girl, she acted as if they had sprinkled tomato sauce on her. <br /> <br /> The movie was boring but I saw it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, it was fun! <br /> <br /> Please keep the actual special effects. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What did we do to annoy Mother Nature?" <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to write to fill the 10 lines. What else can I say that the movie is so boring, I think my comment will be equally boring.
