It is impossible to avoid comparing the "Hero" of Zhang Yimou with the "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" of Ang Lee. Both were Chinese big-budget kung fu movies with an impressive cinematography of the Chinese landscape and a cast of superstars. But aside from the obvious, in fact there is nothing more to compare. "Hero" fails to meet almost all the levels that really matter, which shows that big stars, beautiful landscapes and action effects do not replace the art and vision of a director. <br /> <br /> All the marketing hype that precedes The premiere of 'Hero' has done nothing but make his failure spectacular. Much anticipated, 'Hero' attracted moviegoers when it debuted in the mainland and Hong Kong theaters, making it an instant box office hit. However, although the script pleased government censors, Chinese audiences went to new levels of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain. Online critics, both professional and amateur, proclaimed that the film was "ideologically disruptive," "from the point of view of deep servitude," written by an amateur historian or someone with ulterior motives. An article was simply titled: "Hero, you make me sick!" <br /> <br /> The film's deepest flaw is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and is based on an unforgivable historical fallacy, but, worst of all for a movie, it's boring! It is known that all successful epic films take some liberties with the facts of the story, but 'Hero' goes beyond the artistic license to an unforgivable ignorance when trying to glorify an emperor who was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. 'Hero' does not compensate for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or entertaining. Instead, it is a pitifully bad attempt to be "deep" and manages to be pretentious and preacher. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that China's first emperor was implacably violent, it is known that Mao Zedong had admired this ruler, no wonder, given Mao's own tyrannical rule. Similarly, the communist government of Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and his own methods of iron fist, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of 'Hero', commented during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations, because it was necessary to maintain "stability" in China. For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocking criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he simply voiced out the underlying message of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to overcome the values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in novels and kung fu films, to reveal superior wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out to be: THE OPPRESSOR IS CORRECT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have gone through this message, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could really free himself from that tyranny. The great popularity of the novel of kung-fu can be explained by its capacity to escape to an alternative world: one in which the kung-fu warriors crossed the country in search of adventures and fought for justice, free of fear and Winning against all odds Superhuman skills Only in the novel did the individual overcome the institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions. Against this tradition of the hero of kung fu, Zhang Yimou has not risen to a higher truth, as he had expected, but down to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so pleased. <br /> <br /> Some movie lovers can secretly ask themselves: 'Leaving aside all moralistic judgments, is it at least entertaining?' Fortunately, the answer is a resounding 'No!' Because the same story is told again and again with only slight variations, it becomes tedious to see it. In addition, the three conflicting versions of the same story only serve to confuse the development of the character, since it leaves very little time for the viewer to feel sympathy for any of them once the "real" version emerges. <br /> <br /> The film does not stop having its beautiful images. However, all the scenes vanish because they do not connect or improve the story. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the story is presented as simplistic and artificial, and the cinematography seems consciously more than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you're there to watch the full movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who showed disdain for the unrealistic kung-fu of 'Crouching Tiger', much was expected from 'Hero'. 'Jet Li, who plays the lead role, is a true Kung Fu artist who had national titles before starting his acting career. His previous films have revealed limited acting skills, but many expected Zhang Yimou to use Li's agile body movements to achieve a full effect, while performing well in a role that would not assign him any of his abilities. performance. But it was not going to be. 'Hero' tries to go beyond the Kung Fu genre, so there are not many fight scenes, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult act: an inner transformation that leads to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the casting director should have expected, Li fails miserably. Meanwhile, the only fight scene that reveals a true kung fu ability is the first one in the movie, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so 'Hero' does not satisfy, even at that level. <br /> <br /> Although most audiences outside of China are probably unaware of the historical destruction of the history of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they accept Zhang's version of "Chinese wisdom" , which is anything less. Perhaps the only time that a public that left a projection of "Hero" was seen smiling, instead of yawning or frowning, was in the special projection for officials of the Chinese government. <br /> <br />
