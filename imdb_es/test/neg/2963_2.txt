This was on television last night. With pain I made my way through it, and I barely made it. First of all, except for Leroy, Hilary and possibly Coco, NONE of the other students who are supposed to worry about us have some discernible talent. It's as if HSPA has no standards, just sign on the dotted line and that's it. <br /> <br /> The story lines were latticed and obvious. Doris was incredibly horrible. The gay guy was such a discarded clich√© (it's funny that in that school there is only one gay man, right ...) I liked the character of Leroy, but describe your teacher as obscene and then vandalizing the school should have sent Leroy to pack. Lisa seems to prefer to be anywhere else, and since I had no talent, I wonder why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have rated this star (horrible), but the music was not so bad, and I liked the premise. It would just have worked much better if the students had been attractive and had some talent.
