I started to get a little interested in the movie. It seemed like it could be a serious drama, dealing with death, pain and healing, with some realistic human conflict. Unfortunately, it did not stay. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with something consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this film were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know it was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in the script and the characterization. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is reprimanded for appearing at a dressed picnic. He says that ordering around him will not work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes, she will take off her clothes later. That is a howler. This movie had some unintentionally funny lines. <br /> <br /> It was hard to worry about the character of Jame's Brolin. When he so easily gave the things of his first wife to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be rejected, I lost most of my compassion. Who cares what happens to him. I must confess that I did not finish the movie. If you achieved a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was simply unpleasant to see and so predictable that I felt there was no need to finish it.
