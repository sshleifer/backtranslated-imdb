Well, I must admit that when I saw the trailer for this movie, I was waiting for it. In general, I'm a fan of light romantic comedies and trailer, that's the impression I have of this movie. However, I spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a couple of funny scenes, in general, the picture of the film was quite depressing. <br /> <br /> I also found it hard to fall in love with any of the characters, as they all seemed a bit underdeveloped. The time the director could have used to explore the characters taken by unnecessary excessive use of Opera, making the film feel dragged and slow. It is quite deceptive and I only suggest that you go see this if there really is nothing more that you like more. <br /> <br /> It's not fantastic, and as I said before; Friendly.
