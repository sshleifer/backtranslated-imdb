Not since "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" and the "How High" previews <br /> <br /> have I laughed so little about something that the filmmakers thought <br /> <br /> would be hysterical . <br /> <br /> Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as 4-F <br /> <br /> by the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army- <br /> <br /> of about half a dozen. He then poses as a Nazi commander in Italy, and eventually tries to kill Hitler. That is the description of the weak plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This movie makes "Hogan's <br /> <br /> Heroes" look like Shakespeare. If the money men of "The Producers <br /> <br />" had really wanted to lose their cash, they should have <br /> <br /> shown this movie. I can not emphasize how bad this is. <br /> <br /> The direction of Lewis consists of two different cameras that take the action <br /> <br /> from two different angles, and then they are edited together. This type of comedy direction works on television, but here is an obvious attempt to deceive the audience. Finish most of your scenes <br /> <br /> with a still picture, as if giving the viewer the opportunity to duplicate <br /> <br /> on points before moving on to the next tired configuration. I spent most of <br /> <br /> the film doubled in abdominal agony, accompanied by <br /> <br /> severe flatulence, over this thing. <br /> <br /> Lewis, the director and producer, establishes the film in 1943, but makes no attempt to wear costumes or period ensembles. They all have the latest style <br /> <br /> and have the latest interior design ... for 1970. The support cast <br /> <br /> is lost when Lewis leaves in his patented tangents, < br /> <br /> that last as long as a major surgery and are just as painful to <br /> <br /> see. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he passes the <br /> <br /> last half of the movie screaming at the top of his lungs in a performance so hateful as to stink up any goodwill. try to start <br /> <br /> at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The last shameful shot has Lewis and his friends trying to <br /> <br /> put one on top of the Japanese. They use dollar teeth, squint their eyes and speak with a "funny" accent. It can be one of the most overtly racist events from internment camps. I was <br /> <br /> relaxed in what Lewis did through all of this, but that put me <br /> <br /> to the limit. Watch for the unsavory scene of Kaye Ballard <br /> <br /> where she tries to commit suicide again and again. <br /> <br /> George Takei from "Star Trek" has two small scenes, then wisely <br /> <br /> leaves the image. This has less laughs than the last three combined films of Mel Brooks. There is nothing sadder than seeing a previously respected comedian who ruins a project so horribly, that he actually feels embarrassed by them. Jim Carrey learned that with "The <br /> <br /> Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still appears on TV once in a <br /> <br /> while pulling the same style. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which way to the front?" It's cheap, without grace, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who has to endure this. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although classified (G), this contains some physical violence, some violence <br /> <br /> and some adult situations. If your child shows interest in <br /> <br /> see this, consult a professional. <br /> <br />
