By chance I saw this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and dark. French cinema seems to have lost its footing these days and this is a good example of how a motley script can squander brilliant actors. While some may find that the "joy" of the script is in line with the dictates of later European modernism, the whole project seems more like an autopsy of the death of the golden years of Euro-cinema and truly fabulous talents. Here Bunuel is vaguely remembered, but without charm or wit.
