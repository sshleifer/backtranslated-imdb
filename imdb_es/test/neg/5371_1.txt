This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it is false. But it is agonizing to see it. Personally, I know minds influenced by more creative films that could "make" this look real. The young male leader could not be more unconvincing. He reads everything he says online. Are we really supposed to believe that he knows what he is talking about? There are a lot of ways in which Blair-Witch presents itself. Fear is not reproduced from what seems "great" and generated by computer. Nor is it generated from proverbial lines like "What was that? Did you hear that?" In addition, there are really convincing psychics out there who do not just "want to be on screen". Another factor of DUH is ... how do these producers think that we are really going to buy that the paranormal activity will simply magically happen within 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) that they film? I do not think so. A week 2 + on a site would be more convincing. It is also interesting that they think that including "Nasa radar checks" and computers that show bizarre bs really scare us. IE: The exorcisms should not be organized like the movie "The Exorcist". When are you going to do it right? The possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. Not only do they grunt and lower their voices like Linda Blair or Fallel like Courtney Love in a drug binge. As it was said, a better concentration in the "psychic ability" would help a lot to this show. We want to see and hear EVERYTHING that supposedly blinks before them. Do not cut to another story bs. On a final note, Shooting Stars do not generate interest when false images of UFOs are displayed in advance. Can I emphasize again that the dark-haired young man who presents this show is absolutely bad? Avoid this show. For fear: see old episodes of unsolved Mysteries ... not the new ones (the recreation did it, oh, very bad). But that's for a different blog.
