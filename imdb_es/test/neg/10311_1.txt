The comments above are very generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun giving it to my friends to see it and describe it beforehand as "beyond what you can believe". "There are no words that can express how I feel about this" "This movie will move you" As expected, the friends took these bland comments as enthusiastic backers. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had in giving this to people was worth the $ 5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, an (old) friend says that I owe him 90 minutes of his life. I particularly enjoyed the "gun view" of parts of the movie. Really impressive in its absurdity.
