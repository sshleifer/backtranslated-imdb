The first time I rented this movie was the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Since then, I have seen it several times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would have been a complete horror art work in two hours. As it is, the execution time is only an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Ex-Twisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote, produced and starred in this 1998 crash party in a small town in Colorado. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and a love for near-death experiences. Hendricks is not easy, it is a "modern and modern" six-foot primitive. Someone who has tattooed and pierced his body to the extreme. When he makes his first full appearance in the film, it is a truly terrifying sight. <br /> <br /> Hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his "spiritual awakenings" with his kidnapped victims. Visit Internet chat rooms with the name "Capt. Howdy" and then invite people to your home. They think they're going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks closes his eyes and mouths and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks on numerous parts of his body. If it sounds bad, it is because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of Detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her, but he also arrests Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated for community disapproval. A group of peasants led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his old self. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie I leave to you, only to say that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you with chills. With the exception of Snider, the performance is not very good, but it is useful. The address is fine, too. There are some humorous parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's amazing and it's worth buying if you like rock. In general, this is a movie that is worth seeing. If you love low-budget horror movies with a sense of humor, take a look. You will probably like it.
