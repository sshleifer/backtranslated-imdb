Always enjoy the Classic Horror movies, however, this movie was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the crazy man who can control humans through his experiments. This film was made during the Second World War and John Carradine was a German Nazi who worked to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele played many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this photo, Bob seemed bored of dying in his role in this film and acted in this way as his first film. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff) gave an excellent performance with a great comedy that helped keep the attention of the audience. I hate to criticize a movie made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula in many movies during the 1940s, you might like to see John do his best.
