Well, let me start by saying that this is not a horrible movie in any way. It's just not good. I remember a poster that said that the performance was not countryside, only that it was nuanced. No. I have seen act in Japanese and Asian nuances. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is the camp. <br /> <br /> The characters are totally unfriendly, the deaths are totally random and without any meaning. The writing is bad. I'm fine with suspending disbelief, I'm fine with not having everything in my hand in terms of plotting. But this movie has no argument. One critic said: "This movie is set in a small town where people are going crazy with vortexes and spirals." That's not propaganda, that's the whole damn movie. Congratulations, I just saved you almost an hour and a half. There is nothing more than that. No development of characters, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. And not even the lack of resolution "Acceptable within the realm of J-Horror." Simply nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical score is made by someone who obviously was not watching the movie at that time because it is random enough to cause a whiplash. One thing is cognitive dissonance and, if done well, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems that the score was designed to accompany another movie. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is as if the Japanese remade Evil Dead without any intelligent parts or good acting. It just falls flat. It's J-horror without the horror.
