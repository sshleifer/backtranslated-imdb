Mr. Kennedy should stop the execution of ExPeRiMeNtIng with incorrect movie scripts. What was he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the start stage "hey, I have an idea, let's make a sequel". If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it, but I think I'll settle for a 1. generous. It seems that these days, if you make money, the executives of the film will unearth an old success and execute it for a group of writers and see what appears. (Hey, I said "hit and run!" A little describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS piece of trash never saw the light of day is beyond me. It is full of unpleasant humor, strange animations and jokes that do not take you anywhere, apart from a state of confusion. If you're being dragged into this movie, and someone is paying you ... it's fine ... but it will still be more painful than a brick on your forehead. However, if you plan to pay your own hard earned money, look for a better alternative.
