This film is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man who has a distant relative who moves in with him in his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes on, their relationship becomes more and more tense until, finally, they start shouting at their house guest, who is out of work and does not seem so eager to find work. In fact, it's the biggest part of the movie. The problem is that although emotionally constrained and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and not communicative, they do not constitute a very satisfying movie. That's because most of the time he (and his roommate) just look at space and they do not say anything. I think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30-minute film, I certainly would not have cared.
