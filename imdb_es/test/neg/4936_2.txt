PERHAPS SPOILER !! Well, I've seen it at the Cologne film festival and I must say it's ridiculous ... I'm sorry author and writer and ... whatever, but it's the worst attempt to make a good movie I've seen ... if you have 5000 chances to get away from your enemy and you do not ... it is getting boring ... there are scenes in the movie that give you the impression that they are forgotten, for example a szene in front of a security camera , they are asking for help and someone sees him and calls the police ... that there is a cut and ... ¿¡¿¡¿¿¿¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ NAZA !!! ... the killer is shot in his head and 50 seconds later he is behaving as if nothing had happened ... no, it is not a zombie movie ... and finally the final ... the GREAT END they promised us ... hmmmm, let's say we take a little boy who always wanted to give the world one of the best finals in history so bad that everything goes wrong ... I'm not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...; )
