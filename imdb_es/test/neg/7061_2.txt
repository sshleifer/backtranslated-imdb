In a happy house comes the gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy. With her incredibly wild hair and her voice that sounds very sharp and weird, it's hard to believe that this is Loy! It has no resemblance to the refined and funny character of Nora Charles, who played in the films of Thin Man. Instead, it exaggerates so much that you almost expect her to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a great difference they made a few years ago in the quality films they got, as well as in their ability to act! In addition to the horribly silly character, the film also fails because it is simply not interesting or exciting, just very, very stagy and stupid. The only good thing is the Vitaphone sound system, which makes the sound quality of this turkey the best I've heard since 1929. Hell, it was even better than most of the 1930s movies, so the sound technician At least it has something to be. proud of - everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the Turner Classic Movies host qualifies as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is very bad. And, after having seen it, I disagree ... slightly. The movie is just bad.
