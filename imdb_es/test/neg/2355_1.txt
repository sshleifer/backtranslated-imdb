Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because it could be said to be all this. It takes a real genius to scare generations of spectators to take a shower and wear ties. The saboteur, however, is neither creative nor prolific at all. Rather, Hitchcock set out to create a film to gather "American Pride," a certain title of call to arms, support for our troops, which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely minimized other important aspects of the film, including, among others, a logical plot, a characterization, a credible dialogue and a story that unfolds with fluidity. <br /> <br /> In general, Hitchcock does a great job with spy movies, only a few years before he achieved cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but apparently lost the step in the creation of Saboteur and simply recycled the same exciting story. Lines both your previous excursions easily arranged. Without going into much depth, here is a list of some of the main problems of this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Although his face is pasted in all newspapers in the United States, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At dinner, Kane and Patricia do not want to run to the door because the wrongdoers could grab them and tell the party that they were "door crashes". Logically, what prevents spies from grabbing them and saying this at any time during the night? Also, do we have to remind someone that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can a fan belt cut the handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. Nobody recognizes him ... his face is in EVERY NEWSPAPER! <br /> <br /> 5. The spies reach Kane in the ghost town and assume that he is the man that Freeman sent to work with them ... should not he have some kind of credentials? I know spies do not run around with name tags and picture IDs, but maybe a secret handshake? <br /> <br /> 6. The police pick up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, it still seems that nobody recognizes this guy. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane without evidence? They do not even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades and we are forced to assume that everything is kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police search the Caravan of the Carnival, how do they know that Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed that Kane's story therefore, logically, would not have reported his missing daughter, kidnapped or, more importantly, running with Kane. Why does not this movie employ logic? <br /> <br /> This is a running list. The film is not exciting, the plot is meaningless, and the world is full of people who voluntarily take wanted terrorists to their homes and cars every day because it's not a big deal. Hitchcock fails miserably in this case.
