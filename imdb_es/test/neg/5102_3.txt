This was a very nice concert for the one and only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes decent. The voices were good. I have to admit that their voices were crap in Human Nature and Billie Jean. You could not hear it half the time. The other songs compensate the song. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I can not stop loving you She's out of my life Thriller Billie Jean (Dancing is not singing) Black or white man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If there was anyone other than Mj, it would have been a 9. It is a must. I wish I had been born that way, so I could have got an entry for the best concert of 1992.
