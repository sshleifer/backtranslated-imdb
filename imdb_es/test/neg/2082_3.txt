The Greek location for some parts of the film was very beautiful and the photograph got all my votes and that is the full extent of my praise for this film. I discovered that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes that were so often found in American culture and were superficial and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to see, but their characters seem very narcissistic and unpleasant for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, I wonder how this woman could consider herself a competent star on stage. I was tempted to press the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and the character of Raul Julia was so lustful that it was downright creepy. The movie was too long for my taste and I could not see it again even at gunpoint.
