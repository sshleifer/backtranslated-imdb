Ok, where to start. I can not believe how many good reviews I have read here. I saw this (year 2004) and I had to fight not to press the stop button, I decided to continue only for all the good reviews I read. After seeing it, I felt it was my duty to inform the world about this. In the first place, it seems that the film will never begin, the plot does not really take place until about 30 minutes before the film ends, which leaves the viewer wondering: "when will this start?" a 'revenge movie' because revenge does not even begin until more than half of the movie has already passed. In addition, the film tries to make him believe that it is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I regret that seeing the dusty rural roads half the film and a crooked letter on a poster did not convince me of that, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. So, anyway, add this to the random homoerotic subtext and you'll have a fucking movie (I have nothing against gays, there was simply no need to do it). The only good part was the first persecution scene, a good direction considering it was 1979, and another good part is how it kills the last guy. Basically, I recommend that you see the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, and you will enjoy much more than if you sat through all those things in the middle, which could lead you to take your eyes off. Do not say I did not warn you.
