This movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The created suspense disappeared due to the horrible performance or the director's lack of direction. I do not know. It was like a tasty chewing gum that seemed to run out of flavor but you still chew it because once it tasted good. . Like most thrillers, The Hitchhiker had promised but had not complied when he had bright eyes and was ready to turn down the volume (he was watching the movie alone ... in the dark). transforming into something else. It just ran out of fuel and left me watching a movie similar to TV, with one exception ... it was probably rated as R-R.
