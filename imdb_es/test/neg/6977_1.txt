Sitting in a large wing chair with a huge book in his lap, the only Bela Lugosi looks at the camera and, in a terrible vocal delivery that sounds like he's making fun of a reading of Shakespeare, says in a low voice: "The Man gropes constant things unknown, drawn from the infinite times of time, brings to light many amazing things, most are not new, the signs of the ages "(with a visual beam, accompanied by the sound of thunder that then it continues rumbling for 86 amazing seconds). <br /> <br /> And so begins what could be said The worst movie ever made. This "movie" almost defies description. Counted in a semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator that explains the plot ... as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who dresses in a cross; Hence the reference to Glenda. The movie does not have a real structure. Instead, it consists primarily of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or the transvestite motive. A long sequence consists of an unknown woman who retires on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today call S & M. <br /> <br /> Then, in strange moments, Bela reappears, for no apparent reason. , and babbles a more insane dialogue, such as: "When he makes a mistake because he does it right, and when he is right because he does it wrong, he pulls the rope, he dances for that". Hey? <br /> <br /> Approximately twenty percent of the images in the film consist of footage, accompanied by a VO that is related to the story's motive but not to the images. Therefore, we see images of: bustling city streets, traffic on the highway, a thunderous herd of buffalo and a playground full of children. But it gets worse. In a movie about dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of footage from a smelting furnace that produces hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from World War II. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest elements are failed. In one scene we see a newspaper title that says "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Below the title, which has clearly been pasted or pasted, the article deals with ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman off the screen says: "planes, why is it against the will of the creator", with a voice that sounds like it has just inhaled helium. <br /> <br /> Except for the performance of Lyle Talbot, the performance is uniformly horrendous. The production design is cheap and monotonous; (But you have to love that sticky wallpaper). The edition is neglected. Most of the background music is suitable only for 1950s style elevators. Black and white cinematography has too much contrast. And the wardrobe looks like something that came from a thrift store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Citizen Kane" in comparison. I just do not know how a movie could be made worse than "Glen Or Glenda" by Ed Wood. But fortunately, he has Bela Lugosi in it. Every time I opened my mouth and looked at the camera with those big bulging eyes, I almost fell to the ground laughing.
