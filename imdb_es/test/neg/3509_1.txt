I saw this "movie" partly because of the large amount of good reviews on Netflix, and from it I learned a valuable lesson. However, it is not a lesson about ethnic diversity ... the lesson I learned is "Do not trust the reviews". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism stinks and people are complicated, but the people who really need to see this movie will be the ones who are least attracted and least affected if they see it. The only reason I can think of the amount of good reviews is that it is being reviewed by people who are not used to thinking, or who have seen their first movie that makes them think and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this movie, which should be called "Racism For Dummies," as emotionally heartbreaking as possible, apparently to give people who do not spend a lot of time thinking they've discovered some fundamental truth. It has never been covered in a movie before. Zen and the art of the motorcycle is not ... A special after school for the thoughtless masses, cut into pieces of ham fist to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. <br /> <br /> It's as if they portrayed everyone as the worst possible end, simply to make us happy that we are such good people because we do not identify with the characters. Let's be real people. NO ONE identifies with these characters because they are all cut-outs and cardboard stereotypes (or inversely foreseeable stereotypes). It is well acted (even if the dialogue is atrocious) and intelligently executed, so much so that you do not think about asking "where is the problem?" Until you realize the movie is running out. The scene of the burning car was well executed, like much of the film, but it did not get anywhere at the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy, and from the "behind-the-scenes" propaganda, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there's very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended Fun Parties. . I must emphasize that this is NOT entertainment, more like a diversity lesson in high school ... call it "The blood on the highway" of racism. They might even show this in high schools if it were not for Jennifer Esposito's "nude side" photo. <br /> <br /> In this movie, they are all imbeciles and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pe√±a). who gets the best role, but the most predictable plot). <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, with bad writing and good actors ... an ugly cartoon created by Paul Haggis for people who can 'Handles anything other than the bold strokes in the narrative. .. an image painted with crayons. <br /> <br /> Crash is a little depressing nothing that provokes emotion, but it does not teach you anything if you already know that racism and prejudice are bad things.
