I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a repetition of the first two without charm or humor. I think I laughed once, and it was during the NG. Tucker was extremely annoying in this movie, and his character seemed to have no other purpose than to ruin everything in the most annoying way possible. Chan is always nice, but he seemed tired in this movie. I could predict EVERYTHING: who was the villain, who was the girl, (SPOILER ALERT) who was the good and bad boy, etc. I hope to see more Tucker and Chan films in their separate efforts, but not in more sequels to Rush Hour. He is too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.
