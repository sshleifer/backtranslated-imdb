Hannibal must be the most horrible movie I've seen in a long time. In fact, I want to get my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard performance. What more can I say? If you have not seen it, do not bother. I would not even rent the video and if you saw it on TV ... change the channel. The only reason someone would have to watch this movie would be to see if the gratuitous violence lived up to all the exaggerations (which frankly is the reason why they added it). If you want to see a gug eating its own brain, then advance to that bit. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this movie? It is as if someone had asked "I wonder what Hannibal will do these days" and we went for a walk. He is free at the beginning and in the end he is free. In between there is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers. Julianne Moore tries bravely to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a script of inferior quality and, as far as I'm concerned, she was willing to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is simply A very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason he won so much money was because of the senseless violence that they added, that at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than with the horror that you are supposed to feel. <br /> <br /> I Give him a big fat RASPBERRY!
