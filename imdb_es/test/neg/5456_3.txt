The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul), which exists outside the body, with the result of causing a horrible death (... crushing the inside of the victims leading to the broken spine and broken organs) in those close to the one who has that capacity, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, which gives Karen Black (.. like Janus) another "unique" character with whom she can play as a woman who influences a commercial director, Paul Sharpe ( Winston Rekert), tired of his waning marriage and his boring career. Actually, she is dying and needs her body, her spirit is potentially harmful to her wife and son (... her son has a "special friend" who speaks, even poisoned at some point). A detective, Kauffman (John Novak), who investigates the unusual homicides related to those murdered by the benevolent spirit, links Paul to the deaths and, through him, discovers Janus. Soon both realize that Janus must be stopped or he will simply move to another human host. What Paul does not know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover; both were actually older intellectuals who appear in his astral projection documentary called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) certainly creates a strange atmosphere with this film that contains a rather strange premise. It seems that Paul's child can see the spirit move in the form of a "blue man", manipulating the child into disorderly behavior. Black, despite the treatment with stars, rarely receives close-up shots taking advantage of his face, which can produce the kind of malevolent evil that his character justifies. Instead, he is shot from afar, his voice is doubled, and he never establishes himself with the right threat, which is a lost opportunity, in my opinion. For some reason, despite the intriguing (... if strange) idea that astral projection causes a spirit to kill people from within, the movie never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (... and sound), although sometimes it is changeable and effective, is often quite murky. Rhythm is a problem, too, as the story progresses. The cast is pretty lazy, especially Rekert in the lead, his performance erratic, at best. It does not help that there are few characters (... except Paul's wife) that we care less, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not exactly the nicest person in the world ... it can be quite difficult and bad humor, your unfulfilled career is a reason for such behavior. Black should have been a more prominent figure in the film, however, remains mainly in the background, spoken in the dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely has the opportunity to have fun with his histrionics, which is a shame.
