I would rather have someone cut my eyes off with a razor blade than have to watch this movie again. I saw it from beginning to end thinking that it could not get worse ... BUT IT DID. Writers and producers should be slapped for putting this type of garbage on television. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood, cheat and go to work at McDonalds sweeping the floors and emptying the garbage. Anyone who thinks that this movie is remotely decent should be hung up. They are a shame for humanity. To think that we have soldiers risking their lives for anyone who produces this kind of inane garbage. I am ashamed to say that I am American.
