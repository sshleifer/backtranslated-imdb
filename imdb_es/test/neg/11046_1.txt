Amazing. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Oldboy" because the one I saw was a sordid piece of "Kraapola" poorly written, poorly conceived, exaggerated, that even ignoring for a moment the ridiculously violent scenes they do It's unsuitable for a child's eyes , could hardly satisfy the imagination and thirst for consistency of the plot of a seven-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this pitiful mixture was exhausted in a small piece of wisdom. , "Laughter and the whole world will laugh with you, they will cry and you will find yourself alone", the kind of boring fortune cookie that says that a great author, be it Shakespeare or, more to the point of IMDb, Kurosawa, would have Tirado in the trash can without thinking twice. Where this film should have landed too, if we did not live in an era in which the cheap and the perversely unpleasant are confused with what used to be called "great art". In short, disgust. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 out of every 1000 just for occasional expert camera work. However, it is by no means enough to save this infantile failure from uselessness.
