This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he does not know if he wants to be an intelligent political film, "artistic" or an exercise is eroticism. As a result, it fails in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, the narration and the supposed symbolism have no meaning. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie but that's not a good thing. Of course it has an intense and "unique" aspect, but in the end it can not act. Just look at how he reacts when his lover leaves ... <br /> <br /> Do not really watch this movie, some say he needs repeated visits. I say one is too much.
