Pure Schlock from start to finish. The average 12-year-old child may find that he has an interesting view about discrimination. Otherwise, it is a pure camp-pur resistance test. Like one of those episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has something important to say. <br /> <br /> You will see each plot spinning a mile away in this numbers game. However, it is worth seeing for its representation of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay the elderly to have sex with them (how is the reversal of roles), and lesbian soap operas. Live the ghost of Valerie Solanis!
