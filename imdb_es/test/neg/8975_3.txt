The main part of this light musical story is located in the fictional Midwick College, which is attended by Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) due to the generosity of the theater actress Grace Hayes, her real life mother who plays the same role here , and that manages to supply his love interest through his secretary Mary (Healy) who is his wife in real life. Directed from a weak script, and also hampered by excessive cutting and bad editing, this film provides some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and features good twists of the soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as owner from a snack shop, and Roland Dupree's dynamic dance touch.
