Yesterday I saw the film and stopped it at halftime because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a film through the eyes of a boss, one of the "evil types" in most medieval and fantasy films, is great and offers many possibilities, but ... the film could not capture a of them. I did not feel anything for any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point that I followed it) and the second time jump in history made me resign. Those who expect a deep vision of the emotional situation of a boss in the Middle Ages, a social outcast of that time, may feel disappointed.
