This is the first time I write a comment for a movie that I have not seen until the credits. The reason for this is simple ... people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. Usually, I stay away from many comedies that are in bad taste, but I thought that this is visible. A regrettable decision that was based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi) nice, like A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. <br /> <br /> Where those two movies had their charms and laughs, this did not have any (and I mean none !!). The acting is horrible, especially the 'boss'. Tara Reid was not a surprise, how dare she call herself an actress? The premise is thin and the plot does not thicken at all. It's not a problem if you manage to keep it fun and / or sweet ... but as you probably already guessed, this was not the cast at all! The script felt like it was not over and I would not even be surprised if the director did some rewrites while filming. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent script, really. And it's not exactly Lassie either :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this gut even if you like stupid silly comedies (like me). This low quality film will not be enjoyed by many ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give one, therefore ... to 2.
