(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important that they could not have imagined) Yes, it's really weird. I rented it in a Blockbuster for the reason that I had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box, just a list of the bands that had songs. But after that, I had a time to find it, even here in IMDB. I kept confusing it with "The Night of the Demons", but, you know, they are basically the same. <br /> <br /> The parts that I liked most about this movie were all things in the garage. That black guy from the gym was very funny because of the way he shouted ALL the time. Even when the screaming was not really necessary, he would release a "LISTEN NOW! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS !!!!" And so, they would run cars in front of other cars. But then he got balls and was shot by a zombie with a broomstick that I think he was. The other part that caught my attention was the part of the shock outside the building with the kids that the girl did not want to come to ... What significant aspect of the movie did she give us that? What was it? Because I was there? Why did the movie end with a guy who breaks television in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but it was a bit far away. I mean, he could have turned off the television. Yes, this movie was filmed on a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...
