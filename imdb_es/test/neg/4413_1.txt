I saw this movie once in a children's matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959, when it was released and I was 11 years old. It was one of the three functions that were shown that day. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since, but I've wanted to do it because I'm a movie buff and I appreciate how terrible it is with big, good and medium-sized movies. <br /> <br /> What I remember most vividly is that the most sophisticated members of the public, It consists of children between 8 and 15 years old, howling with laughter at the tree monster. <br /> <br /> A triple account in a theater with 3 adventure films is something that an 11 year old does not forget, but I do not remember The names of the other 2 movies. (One was played by George Montgomery and David Farrar). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other 2 films in this triple bill were much better. They were "Watusi" in 1959, starring George Montgomery and David Farrar and "The Angry Red Planet" in 1959, with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden watching. Ms. Hayden has also written a couple of books on health and fitness.
