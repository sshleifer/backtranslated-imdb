There is an inherent problem when commenting or reviewing a movie like this one. I remember feeling the same after disliking Dogma. If you do not like a movie that is strange and controversial like Mulholland Dr., you are seen as "I do not understand". Of course, for those who have already seen this movie, they know that the whole point is not understood anyway. <br /> <br /> I have heard from several different sources that the unique and pleasant aspect of this movie is a dream. As the quality it has. In other words, the plot is not structured like other films. With the case of Mulholland Dr., it seems more an unfocused collage made by a third-grade child who postponed until the last second to make his art project. It does not make sense, I'm not supposed to, but I know it was going to be a television series at the beginning. It seems that Lynch had a lot of unused movies and decided to combine them with a lot of new things. You will notice that nudity, sex and dirty language increase towards the end. All the things that I would not have filmed for television. <br /> <br /> For a better movie that is not told in a traditional and linear way, rent The Thin Red Line since 1998. That was a great movie, it's not. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of ten
