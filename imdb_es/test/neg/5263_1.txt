Kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating men. Throughout the movie, you can meet several of your lost boyfriends. And throughout the film, you are subject to Kate's negative and cynical perspective on love and relationships. This negative point of view is continued throughout and presented as the ultimate Truth. I had a real problem with this. Why would anyone want to be taught about love, life and dating with someone who is obviously so messy? It would work if that were the joke, but it is not. For the jokes of the movie to work (which are neither funny nor original), you must believe what Kate is saying: that all relationships end inevitably with bad or sexless sex, that the highest level at which a relationship can evolve is when you are able to fart in front of your partner ... You have an idea. <br /> <br /> There is no film in recent memory that comes as close to the stomach as to Love & Sex. Why did the filmmakers waste their time on such garbage? Every joke in Love & Sex is something that I have experienced in another movie or in my own life. There is nothing original or creative about history, production or style. It is cynical, mute and meaningless. The mind numbs you!
