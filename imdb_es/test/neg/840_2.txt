Honestly, I do not know where to start when reviewing a film as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good laughs scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this hour and a half of loss of time and life. It's incredible that someone has been able to gather a group of people willing to act, film and edit this piece of garbage, and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the film, we see Ernest posing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and heads of African animals, making faces and gestures that would probably make 3rd grade students laugh . This opening scene gives the viewer an idea of ​​Ernest's frequent attempts at humor, and demonstrates how his comedy remains flat 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really impressed me about this movie is how bad it is. Acting is Everyone in the movie is a typical movie actor, but Linda Kash stands out as being especially terrible. She is the epitome of overacting; all its lines are presented with a surprisingly inhuman enthusiasm that you will only find in a secondary work. Most of the high school theater students could probably have replaced these actors and offered a more powerful performance. Jim Varney, at least, shows some comic ability from time to time, but for most of the movie, he just acts like a complete retard, trying to be funny by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then return to the United States, where an unidentified man runs from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of "two for a dollar" items, and then runs out of the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a waitress he likes, so he goes to the flea market and, of course, buys the priceless gems. Later he takes them back to his house, paints them and sticks them together to make a yo-yo. He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe, and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are tracked by the henchmen, and then taken to Africa to keep them as prisoners. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie really does not make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa, he falls off the truck in which he is taken and lands in a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant called "Hey You". His skin is dark and he has a spine fabric. At first, I thought that Jim Varney was playing another role in the film besides Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that stands out in my mind is Completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African desert. Rene and Ernest have taken a truck of ostrich farmers and are being chased by the henchmen. Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road, both henchmen are firing at Ernest, who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, is throwing ostrich eggs to the henchmen and the driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five-minute chase, but Ernest can defend himself by hitting them and the driver in the face, causing his car to veer off the road and explode into a giant plume of smoke. I should also add that Ernest is throwing the eggs, two at a time, with a large bra. <br /> <br /> The design of the set is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large part of the film in which René and Ernesto walk through Africa, trying to find civilization. During their trek, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which probably could have shot anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply grassy fields, with no hint of being near Africa (they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background), and the jungles look like rural Connecticut forests with papier-mâché skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from the trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was filmed in South Africa, but still would not believe it. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on and on, Ernest joke after Ernest's joke. The rest of the movie does not make any sense either; the members of the African tribes speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged to a "Battle of Truth" by the trusted man, who suddenly wears a suit that resembles that of a ninja, but that it also resembles that of a submission of slavery. The henchman has a table of axes, swords, knives and maces in front of him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and some other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is painful to watch. I could not handle it all at once; I had to stop in the middle and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varney's mood. They should put a general warning of the surgeon in the box so that people know that, in fact, they will be delayed a bit more when finishing this film. I should say that of all the films I've seen, none of them is as regrettable as Ernest Goes to Africa.
