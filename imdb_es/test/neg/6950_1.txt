I have to start with this by saying that I LOVE watching bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100%. It is unquestionably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's full of shit footage of random things in a city (people walking, traffic, the horizon, etc.) that does not relate to anything. Then there are the 'sex scenes' too long. These involve many caresses and frequent rubbing of socks on the bodies of others. These are not in any way erotic and are the closest thing to the horror you'll find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene, where two of the so-called 'barely legal' girls who could not have a day over 40 are sprayed with blood, but there is also a crew member who drains blood from the outside while one of the girls continues to smile at him. Nobody had to memorize any line for this movie, if they are not reading the cards clearly and then have a magazine in front of them that they keep watching while they fight for an uncomfortable dialogue. Then there's Mr. Creepo. Throw the name of Ed Wood as if you could compare, but it is far from being of that quality. He walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie, which really helps the complete lack of flow that the film already had. We could not stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were assaulted and sometimes we were horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 1/10 to go well above all my expectations for a horrible movie.
