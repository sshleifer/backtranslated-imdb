"The Chilling", directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunseri, is one of the worst zombie movies I've seen. Therefore, appeared Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") in this stink. The plot is really silly: frozen bodies in a cryogenic laboratory are revived after lightning attacks and become cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look horrible and there is no blood. Avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
