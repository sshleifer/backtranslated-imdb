I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it is not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring, but charming. What is this?? What a crap! It's stupid and really, really boring. It is the worst of the series. I can not see it again because I fell asleep at the first clock. And the bad side of Ug ... eeewww ... is one of the most horrible moments in the movie. In the first 50 minutes, we can not see the little furry monsters, that's why the public fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
