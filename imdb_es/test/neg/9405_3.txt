You just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much that I actually went to see them the opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. History has a lot of potential and it's frustrating to see it ruined. I really feel that the problem with the film was the direction and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not an enemy of MM, I thought it was amazing in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt 3 or 4 times more. Yes, we all understand that he was a handsome guy with a good body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when he appeared on stage in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt out of pumping iron like a sweaty crazy 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think that once would have been enough. I would not be surprised if they launched those unnecessary scenes so that brides and wives would be willing to accompany their partner, no woman wants to see a movie about sports betting, unless ... Enough is enough. let's go into your paper. I feel that his performance was very forced and did not seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and corny. It was almost as if he were referring to the Lines of Days and Confused several times! In short, I did not like his character, although he was supposed to. The accent, shirtless, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was a tool too, like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that's not a surprise. It's fun to see Piven as Arie ... oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel that this movie was very commercial and it got screwed up. It's an insult that they can take a big story and throw away shitty ingredients to try to make it a blockbuster. 1. A great story that attracts male man 2. Hunky Hollywood female actor (make sure you have numerous scenes without a shirt lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great scenes of speeches and 25 great liners 3. All the characters are he will dress in suites of one thousand dollars and he will have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven will interpret the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Launch Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Argument, good writing, character development and casting smart is not necessary <br /> <br /> This will be good enough for most people, but not for me! Anyone who does not agree with me, ask yourself this. This movie would be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> It's probably part of the minority to think that this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous final scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while hugging Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The film that is made public obtains what the film wants to be made public, big budget.
