This movie is sometimes a wild sex comedy of the 80s in college, sometimes it's a romantic sweet ... Then it has moments of serious drama and then it spreads into sci-fi scripts ... It's so jerky that it's almost ridiculous. <br /> But I would hardly classify it as one of the worst movies I've seen, except, of course, for the fact that they threw Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing for him to work with here Bad dialogue, bad performances to work with, poor everything ... And yet, it's fantastic ... There's nothing good about him and, nevertheless, it makes it work even if only for pure charm. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so capable of achieving so much with so little highlights the large number of flaws in this movie, so it seems even worse than I suppose it is ... <br / > <br /> If any other actor were in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie like crap and I would never have thought of it again, but a good performance by Peter O'Toole despite all the odds I will remember this movie for a long time. time to come ... If only as a movie, maybe, it could have been good if someone involved in it was almost half as good as Peter O'Toole.
