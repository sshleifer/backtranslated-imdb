It's a space movie, or at least I think it is. you have half-naked prisoners in a space prison and a monster in a space station that uses a virus to infect humanity through sensual encounters. Your Hilarious Friggin. The acting is so bad that Space Nuts looks like an Emmy-winning movie. The story is simple. The space prisoner has the opportunity to reduce the sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and angry with aliens. She fights against them, and so on. It's a movie that is worth watching just to get your pants wet with laughter. If you like real sci-fi movies, it's a no-no, but it's an excellent creator of encouragement for the amateur filmmaker, because I can guarantee that your film is better than this.
