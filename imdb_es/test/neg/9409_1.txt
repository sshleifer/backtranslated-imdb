For all the actors and the team that worked on this excuse for a movie, another day of payment in L.A. For any audience wanting a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (for me) is that we are seeing an extremely talented actor, Pacino, apparently playing a parody of himself. That is what remained to me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for people in the film industry to work and earn a living. What I can not understand is an artist of Al Pacino's talent who prostitutes himself and is ashamed with this level of meaningless trash. We hope you choose projects of better value in the future ... and for your value, save time and money earned with effort. Skip this! Let's send Hollywood and Al a message.
