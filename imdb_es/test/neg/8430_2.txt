I remember seeing this miniseries for the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and outrage. After reading the comments on this title, I must agree with those of the people in Greece. This occurred to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and, to me, it seemed nothing more than an exercise in Jingoist and American nationalism in which American athletes are glorified at the expense of everyone else. Some other nationalities would have every right to be deeply insulted by the way they were portrayed in this series. However, it can help explain how many American viewers behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and television coverage that seemed only interested in the events that Americans could win.
