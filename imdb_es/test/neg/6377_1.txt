Jon Stewart (also known as John Liebowitz) constantly breaks conservatism and anything Republican. This liberal comic is nothing, since it pours its cutting "humor" into the throats of impressionable young people. I watched the show while I was stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy limits the betrayal. He will take the side of Al Queda over Bush any day. It's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a hint of false laughter. I remember four years ago when he "interviewed" John Kerry. The two looked at each other face to face, which seemed to impede a recovery session. It was like, "Get a room, guys." I just do not like the little smiling traitors who sell their propaganda. Call me shallow The Daily Show has had a long history and there are many like-minded liberals who feel a pressing hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I am not surprised at his success, but do many people see Comedy Central? That Mancia guy makes me throw up.
