I'm a big fan of the Farcry game, a big fan. He still has a place on my list of the 10 best games of all time! The story line was new, fresh ... A truly brilliant basis for basing a film on ... or so he thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is no less than another attempt by the directors collect in a franchise of successful games (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). <br /> <br /> The videogame begins when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a cave by the sea after being shot from his ship by a role-playing game of an unknown soldier. Jack finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him through islands, shipwrecks, jungles, facilities and VOLCANOES, to find his (friend?) (Valerie Constantine), the whole battle against mutated super soldiers and genetically modified animals improved. <br /> <br /> The movie plays in a very, very different way: 1: there is an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the movie) of "background story" before we get to the "pop" scene ship's". 2: Jack then walks to the beach, kills some thugs, then leaves ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end ... 4: The 'modified soldiers' seem albino with singles in ... And there were no mutated "monkey-like" creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of Farcry's game I liked very much ... 5: No scenes on the beach full of sun, aircraft carriers, communications stations on large cliffs, SMALL reference to any content of the game (characters / articles / vehicles), in fact No attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: The climatic scene of the game volcano is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is a scene of Ending ... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after ... WHAT THE! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a player, you will hate this movie with all your soul. It's a film clearly aimed at men, so girls, stay away ... So, if you're a man, from 12 to 29 years old, Farcry has never played and is not upset by the attempts of the directors of bring books / games to the movies. ... Then this is for you...
