I had no idea what this movie was about, it jumps from the line of the plot to the plot of the line uniting erratically the incoherent ideas to each other. It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> the cut timeline does not help either. We start in the present, we go back to the past and then we go back to the future to go back to the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is also full of horrible lines and cliché themes like the princess and the poor, "you can not have me even in my death", "you do not even love me enough". cliché to the max! <br /> <br /> The fight scene was horribly corny, the lighting was constantly out of place, which compensated the CG with the actors (that is, you could say that some of the funds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Even though the society in di moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I really would not recommend it to anyone, avoid it if possible. <br /> <br /> If I found this comment hard to follow, the movie would be just as bad.
