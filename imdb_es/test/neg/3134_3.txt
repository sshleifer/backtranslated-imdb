Bardem is great. The actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do it like that. It's OK to defend your position on euthanasia, an extremely sensitive issue. But doing so makes him lose his sense: the film is false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this mentally ill man who wants to get someone to kill him, without understanding the implications of that. It seems he does not care about anyone and thanks them for their care, love and attention. I think that Amenabar could have made people think about this issue in a different way, but I think the way he chose to do it is wrong. He could have made his most powerful point by exposing the other side of the coin without making fun of it.
