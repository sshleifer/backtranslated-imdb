An old high school teacher used to boast that he had seen all the movies he HAD MADE, so one day, a friend of mine and I decided to invent a movie called "Pacific Inferno". Later, we had a discussion about whether the lead role was played by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came up to us and informed us that Jim Brown was playing the lead role in "Pacific Inferno." We thought he was stuck in a lie, that was until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's horrible. Our invented film had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the image.
