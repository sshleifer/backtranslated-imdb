These writers are trying to recreate the characters they have in "bushes" in a different occupation, however, the characters with whom they are trapped have no charisma or acting ability not to mention that the writing seems poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing was not so unpleasant, which leaves the programs only as a lifeline to be two attractive teachers who barely keep it alive. The humor in this show seems to be trying to target an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or less. Another reason why this program is becoming a failure could be that the writing in the program "scrubs" is excellent and this program has to continue, leaving the viewer in a strange position without knowing whether to cry or simply lose hope in new comedies all together. This is just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now before they humble themselves more than they have already done.
