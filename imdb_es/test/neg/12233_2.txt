One might think that, given that this movie has a bad reputation, I would exaggerate when I said that I hated this movie. But seriously, this movie was so stupid and so funny and such a waste of time. The first 30, I had a big headache and the smile on my face (which was preparing to laugh) was running out. When this movie ended, I felt very happy and because I had good expectations that it would be funny. I felt extremely disappointed. The acting is not excellent, the moments of comedy are unconvincing. Fortunately, everything is good in this, because I laughed as maybe 2 parts. In general, this is so boring and I can not tell you how horrible this is. I mean, I think this could be used as a suicide technique. I want to say that I do not think that for some it is even observable. So my final words on this are: AVOID ALL COSTS.
