This show is amazing and we have been enjoying it thoroughly. Located in Alaska, I do not agree with the homosexual content on tonight's show. I feel like you're pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. It's one thing to have a New Yorker struggling in the wild state of Alaska, but trying to turn the town of Alaska into New York? This is a good program about delicate women and real Alaskan men, and bringing a same-sex partner into the mix is ​​losing your balance. Alaska must be portrayed as a man and New York as the woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you are all doing. We can not have a good show without the imbalance of nature.
