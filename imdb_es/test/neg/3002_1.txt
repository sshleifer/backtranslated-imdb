A pretentious narration like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque and unstructured threads to perplex the audience. 2) Only deal with 'big' issues such as life, death and God. 3) Make it look deep with scenes from life, death, heaven, etc. 4) It depends on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) And, finally, laugh all the way to the success of the critique. <br /> <br /> This movie is a false pretext for intellectualism in its boldest form. These filmmakers not only do not answer any questions, but they also fear asking the questions. The film is held together by wisps. The directions get up and fall awkwardly. Pop cultural references are shaky and arbitrary. There is so little to point out, that any critical hit will be missed. <br /> <br /> The critics who found an intellectual basis in this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this film is about. Good news: neither are the filmmakers. Successful attempts to answer profound questions about human existence demand ingenuity, intellect, poetry, and genius. Unfortunately, this movie does not show any of these traits.
