I just saw this at the Madison Horror Film Festival and I was disappointed. Some funny and shocking moments (like the hole of Carla, a harpy urinating in Dreamland) and two interesting places that compete with each other (similar to New Nightmare with beliefs that give life to a mythical character and also Lost Highway with a man living a fantasy in his head) but had long stretches without movement and development of incoherent plot. Just because you use the frame of dreams or a state of mental flight does not Lynchian. You need attractive visual images and spooky performances. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a real comedic rhythm and all the girls were very nice. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt seemed to be having fun. And at least Tom Savini looked like he had his lines memorized and we could not see if he was just reading reference cards. <br /> <br /> I get the references from Hammer, but it seems that the director realized that the script was a snoozer and just added some crashes to try and get some laughs from whatever footage he could put together. But they do not work because they are very few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. Face it 30 minutes from all the fun parts and you could have a short ridiculous and surreal, but throughout the show, skip it. It's not "so bad it's good", it's just "so bad that it's boring".
