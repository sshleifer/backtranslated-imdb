I have researched Ed Gien a bit and found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien, was quiet and lonely, not a fan of imbeciles like in this movie. I will say that I did not finish this movie but I will. I will shudder at the fact that all of us, the people of Wisconsin, speak as if we were from Kentucy. You know the funny thing, but so sad in this movie, is that Wisconsin is not as attractive as they made it look. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only an insult to the people of Wisconsin, but I am also a Wisconsite, but it is a complete insult to a man who proved to be a crazy and lonely man. He killed two people and the movie could not even do that well. Ed did not come so close to the people and scared them, he killed them. So, why do these films lie and say "BASED ON A TRUE HISTORY"? This is not based on anything other than the lies that the director discovered in his disgusting head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing else! <br /> <br /> Well, I'd like to add to this one. I finished this oh so sad movie, and personally I would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I'd like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and NO DESERT! What the hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous and that was supposed to be filmed in Californa. <br /> <br /> Well, for those who do not know anything about Ed Gein, I would like to give you their history lesson. It was believed that Ed Gein had killed his family, but it was never proven. He killed a bartender, he was shot in a bar when nobody was nearby. He took the DEAD bartender to his house. 10 years later, he shot and killed the store employee, stole the cash register and the store truck. He was caught for this murder, he arrived the day before when his son was there and asked him about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was there buying the antifreeze, and the receipt that only had antif ... was the only evidence they had to start hunting a man around the world. Stole graves, in fact stole 56 graves. He hates the people he dug up and made furious; Lamp screens, armchairs, chairs, and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family that he had dined with from time to time and they threw away all the meat he once gave them when they caught him, considering he had been trapped in his house. He was arrested and hidden in the back of a police car, for fear of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book that the judge who judged it wrote. <br /> <br /> After I finished this movie, after seeing everything horrible, I was not only offended by the directors' horrible opinion of what women in Wisconsin look like. I mean it was hard to know who had this guy on the slab half the time, you know why the women of Wisconsin are all BLOND. Please! I am very offended by the lack of homework that this boy did and the bad work he did in this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is and I think he may be fine with something else, but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all this I am so sad that I wasted 3.99 in the movie. <br /> <br /> Movie after finished was completely false, this movie is as if it said that the world is flat and that George Washington was not our first president. Come on folks, that's your story, and this is Wisconsin's story. To finish this rant, how would you all feel if you made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think it's okay, but it would not be true) and he lived and was not the president and whatever . You can not rewrite history
