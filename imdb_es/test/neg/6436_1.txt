The other lower rating reviewers have summarized this wastewater so perfectly that there seems to be little to add. I must emphasize that I was only imposed the Cockney Filth during the visits of my children, who insist on seeing the Sunday bus. My God, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it consists completely in that the totally unpleasant characters are unpleasant to each other, but it is ten times worse than the next one could be worse. The critic who mocked the bilge "faithful to life" that his defenders spit was very successful. If someone lived in a social environment like this, they would cut their wrists in a matter of days. And I can assure anyone who is not familiar with the real East End that it is more 'ethnically enriched' than you will ever see here. Take my advice: avoid this nadir of the British television industry. It is evil
