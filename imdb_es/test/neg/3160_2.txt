Spheeris used this documentary to promote a stereotype of punks. This documentary is partial and guided, not objective. Cutting techniques that jump from one interview to another can be used to get the spoken word of the interviewees out of context. When you look at the movie, the idea that comes out of the interviews with the punks is that they are pretty stupid. The members of the band and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all. I doubt very much if some of the interviewees knew what Spheeris was creating or if they saw that the final product would be allowed to be included in the project. This movie puts the punks in a bad position by making them look unintelligent and simple. The Spheeris movie should not be taken as a representation of the punk scene of L.A. If you want to see a good punk documentary, watch "Another State of Mind" with the Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
