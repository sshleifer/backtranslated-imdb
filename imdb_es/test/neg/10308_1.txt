Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. In general, I take pride in being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad it is, but this was too much. I would only suggest seeing this movie as a torture device. If you can overcome the terrible plot and the dialogue by watching it in silence, the even more terrible work of the camera and the bad quality special effects make this film a real horror. If you're thinking about seeing this because you're a Sandra Bullock fan, do not worry, since you have less than ten minutes of screen time and your acting is absolutely outrageous. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, at least then we would not have to listen to the terrible dialogue.
