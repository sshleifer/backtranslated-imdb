This movie is really amazing, over the years I have acquired a taste for Japanese Monster movies and I am aware that the first examples of this genre can be bad. However, this one reaches a new low, as it follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A young man who controls a giant Robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seems to have an endless supply of horrible giant monsters in his provision.
