For a country that has produced some of the best playwrights in the world and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of bewilderment to me because of the large number of Irish theaters that has been so outrageous. Perhaps because, by their very nature, those talented in the field of Irish cinema have been quick to leave their native land for careers in Britain or the United States (Colin Farrell is a recent case), and that the really successful Irish directors who have continued working in Ireland and with Irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I think especially of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate films with an Irish stage and projects filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> However, "Middletown" is very much an Irish film, although two of its main actors are English. It is certainly well made of its kind and could have countered the trend that Irish films are not really good; ("I Went Down" by Paddy Breathnach, written by the brilliant playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately, this story of fundamentalism unfolds in a fictional Irish city, probably in the north of Ireland judging from the accents, (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me), and probably in the recent past (the years Fifty? Sixty?) is so exaggerated that it is really quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film seems true and you can not help but feel that its writer, Daragh Carville, has been strongly influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that all this might have made more sense had it been established in the biblical American belt and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never as crazy as this one. Everything is meant to be grim in a great way and it certainly is, although it was more prone to giggles than those of Frisson's on the right, the antics of the Reverend Matthew Macfayden. He has the Ulster accent, and there's nothing wrong with his performance or Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays's wife, but the script is so frighteningly derivative that the good acting can not do anything. to save the movie. So, instead of taking another step on the stairs to the Irish cinema "Middletown", I'm afraid it's just another nail in his coffin.
