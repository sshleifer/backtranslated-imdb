The story is a crossed out claimant who made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect him forever. A group of friends finds the gold and the old miner speaks to him and they are forced to blow the gold to the stars to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how does this movie NOT win the Oscar for the movie of the year? What a convincing argument from the young people of the last 20 years who have been running from a bridge of claims since the 19th century. I love how in other movies you can not kill the monster, but you can eliminate it ... this movie write the monster as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film clearly starts Nightmare on Elm Street, part 4, but what the hell, it's not like that movie was a 5-star classic either. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school, never left. from the city, I never learned to read or write ... but he speaks perfect English, he's smoking and he's wearing the latest fashions. How the Oscar missed that? <br /> <br /> Well, I've finished with the bad jokes, this movie is pure shit and I only see it if you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are already in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
