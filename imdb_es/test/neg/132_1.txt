Let me start by saying that 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It is unfortunate that IMDb does not have the tenths of a star ... I saw this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia, and it was absolute garbage. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The movie was absolutely boring. "malachi" resembled the Shadow with Alec Baldwin (The Shadow is infinitely better than this too) Eve's character was so underdeveloped and two-dimensional that it did not even get my attention. I did not even know that her name was Eva. Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. The "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic. When it came, the film had done such a horrible job of creating suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought "Who gives a S ***". The only thing that made me even raise an eyebrow about this movie was the fact that the doctor. the teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (also a movie that was light years before this film massacre). Anyone who has been involved in this film should be ashamed of himself for losing 90 minutes of countless people's time. No wonder that no actor in this film has had a fruitful career. In summary .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and I need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the new version) was better and I dare to say that Saw IV was better ...
