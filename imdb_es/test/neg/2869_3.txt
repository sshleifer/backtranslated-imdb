I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I could not resist this when I saw it for £ 1.99 on Gamestation. It is the first screenplay of Bam Magera, written by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo, and starring the entire CKY team (Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). Brandon is also in charge of the artistic direction, which is one of the greatest merits of the film, it is quite irresistible in its color style, but it also shows the progression. <br /> <br /> Basically, it follows (very freely) the breakup of Ryan Dunn with the girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, who goes by the name of Vilo Valo by chance) and Falcone (Bran) play their best companions who stink the chaos by doing various stunts. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like the CKY movies but with a linear story (which is very basic) and bad acting. It's strange, the gang generally super charsmatic seems to have life snatched from them when they know what they mean next. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are pretty atrocious for the most part, but the second half of the movie is much better than the first one (although 90 minutes is a stretch for the movie), and there is a series of redemption factors, such as the cameo by Tony Hawk, the plots of Dicimaillo as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not ALL cKy and HIM, in fact, Bomfunk MC has stolen the movie in terms of his use of music). In the second half of the film, the sense of fun is much more real, especially because Don Vito has a prominent role in the last part, and seems to steal all the scenes in which he finds himself. <br /> <br /> The movie will appeal to those who like CKY's antics, but only for the central material and not for the filling or plot of the story. Oh, and someone will tell Bam that skating mounts, especially in movies, are very few in 1998. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the package on the DVD is not the movie, but 40 minutes of Making Of 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab's own alchemy and the real feelings of the crew in an amazing and sincere way (as usual, Bam presents himself as an imbecile, especially towards drinking of Raab problem and Ryan Dunn appears as a really nice guy on the ground). The last ten minutes of the documentary deal with a friend (who is a rare member of CKY) who tries to kick heroin while staying at the Magera's house with the crew, and a gang side (especially Ape and Ryan) actually appears: a surprising jewel on an otherwise boring DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99, I'm very satisfied, although I hope that Bam will stay with the improvised and short scenes from now on.
