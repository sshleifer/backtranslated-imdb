I am a human being of almost two decades who has been reading comics for most of my life. I'm not a big Fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm quite familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (legend of the movie B) produced the first feature film, I think, Fantastic Four. The result was so pure that it never became known. Even so, there are copies, mainly in the network and in conventions. If you're looking for a laugh and you can find a copy, do yourself a favor and check this out. <br /> <br /> The film basically tells the origin of the FF and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain called The Jeweler, essentially the Mole Man with a penchant for the little mafia. As with these comic movies, everything has to be linked to everything, so the FF play a vital role in the creation of Dr. Doom, and he and the Jeweler play a vital role in theirs. <br /> <br /> First, I just want to mention that despite everything that went wrong in this movie, I really liked the guy who played Doom. He does not get many decent lines, but when he does, he hits them. The armor looks pretty good too. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... it's a dirty mess. Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, everything basically bad. Boos, especially for Jay Underwood, which gives a new meaning to the word overactive like Johnny Storm. He is not exaggerating, he is extracting. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, well, everyone looks good, and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but they just do not seem to be a real team. On the one hand, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In an early section, Ben and Reed go to visit the two, Johnny likes 8 and Sue at 12. This only makes his eventual romantic partner much more spooky. Thing's disguise looks more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the Human Torch is really a Human Torch, it looks like the Silver Surfer tinted red. <br /> <br /> I could write for hours, but I think the scene that best sums it up is a climatic encounter with the not-so-human torch mentioned above. He is running a laser beam, and finally destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam With a punch. Then he flies around and says "Yippeee!" much, with which the camera tilts down and flies towards TOWARD THE EARTH. Evidently, the intellectual Reed forgot to inform Johnny that fire does not exist in the vacuum of space. This and many other scenes operate like Looney Toones, if the character does not know they are on a cliff, they will not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I'm glad it's never been released. .
