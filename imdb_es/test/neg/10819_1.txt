Terrible! Sad! Horrible! Funny! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Right, you're stuck in "The Cave" with several "Hard" Men and a Woman or two, you're being systematically killed by "Something" and YET you can not hear ANY naughty words grow! !! A 15 Cert 'here in England, and you could say it! <br /> <br /> The Egos of the "Macho Men" was too much, passes the bucket and I'm going to get sick. <br /> <br /> This film should never be exposed to daylight and, ironically, stay in the darkest and deepest hole in the ground and forget forever. I have the feeling that this description is not the first time he takes his head out of a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> As in the movie The Cube, it seemed like a good concept, but it was simply left down in the last post of, well, it's oneself. <br /> <br /> This comment contains Spoilers, it's fine, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce.
