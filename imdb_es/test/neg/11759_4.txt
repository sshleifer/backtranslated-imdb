This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. The good performance of Roberts convinces us of this fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so weak, that any development of good character that has been achieved, is denied by gaps, inconsistencies and boring movie sequences. <br /> <br /> In general, I am an imbecile for daring and distant plots. The examples I like include "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". Along with the fact that I must admit that this movie had a good performance, I am even surprised that I can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The full breakdown of this movie occurs midway through the movie. All the comedy is lost instantly and the film darkens. Afterwards, the movie goes on. The film's attempt to make comedy go back to roll is unsuccessful. More surprises await the viewer and are even darker. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. However, with this film, the result is as successful as the "new coca cola".
