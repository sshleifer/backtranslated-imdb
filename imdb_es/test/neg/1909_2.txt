Ho hum. The rich and handsome boy gets into trouble, the poor girl falls in love with him, the ex-boyfriend and jealous cause tension ... yadda yadda. In fact, I laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was very predictable and just plain stupid. As one scene moved to the next, I often wondered how I had got there, as if I had skipped some chapters of a book. <br /> <br /> The script was very unfortunate and I did not have it or my wife cares a lot about any of the characters, except for the boyfriend. Now, if the ex-boyfriend had taken an ax, and had separated the girl and the rich boy, then ... we would have a movie, and all the dialogue and the jumps in the plot could be acceptable. But, since this movie tries to be touching and completely misses the boat (and ends up resorting to the romantic equivalent of divine intervention to try to tear a tear) ... it just falls very, very flat. > Avoid this movie. Trim your toenails instead, you will have more fun.
