Riccardo Freda can have a good reputation; but as we now know that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great Mario Bava; It is clear that he was not one of the most talented filmmakers in Italy in the seventies. This film shows quite a bit that despite the simplistic plot; It is an extensive disaster and, in general, I even have to go so far as to say that the Tragic Ceremony is WORST than the insipid effort of Giallo de Freda, The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire. Freda apparently rejected this movie, and I certainly do not blame him! The plot simply follows a group of children who run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They happen in a house while they look for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, since the owner is about to perform a satanic ceremony ... buzzing. The film presents a main role for Camille Keaton, who will star in the exploit classic I Spit on Your Grave some years later, but fails to impress here despite acting with a cast of artists without talent. The film presents a scene of decent blood towards the end, but this really is not enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. I have a high tolerance for garbage from Italian movies that do not make sense, but even I could not stand this. You miss it, do not miss anything!
