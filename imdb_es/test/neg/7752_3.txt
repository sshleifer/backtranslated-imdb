Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis, and it's such a cluttered vision of claustrophobic environments, odd costumes and noisy "extravagant" little characters that one thing is for sure: you want to go to hell as soon as possible (unfortunately, you It will take about 80 minutes). The story similar to "Alice in Wonderland" is meandering and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world who could have turned this into a good movie, although Kathy Ireland makes an attractive attempt (annoying voice and all ).
