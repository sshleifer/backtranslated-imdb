Visually beautiful with a bit of good music, this movie has a fairly trite television quality. The romance between two characters, which embraces a cultural and educational division, is simply NOT plausible. Of course, from the beginning we knew that our trembling heroine would lighten, win the locals and find true love, but that makes it no less regrettable that the film had to give the twists so completely expected. This movie had many promises, which makes it more shameful that the promise has not been fulfilled. Maybe a nice place under the blanket on a cold cable gift night, but I certainly would not recommend the rent or the paid purchase. Although I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful.
