Even Disney is guilty of the disease of commercial cows, after the resounding success of The Love Bug in 1968, the mouse house charged money with Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. No sequel that captures the charm and harmless appeal of The Love Bug in 68, in this we find racing driver Jim Douglas and his partner Wheely Applegate, entering Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally. Naturally, things outside the race begin to take over priorities, get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car. The automobile maneuvers are, of course, pleasant and pleasing to the eye, and it would be ridiculous for me to actually dump the poison on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the movie is not going anywhere and I can now personally see it for the coin motivated work is. You can still see Herbie take a bath, frustrate the bad guys and, of course, dance for the lady in her life, so I think there's something for everyone ................ ... .4 / 10.
