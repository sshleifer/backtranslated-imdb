This movie was horrible, plain and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was VERY clear that this movie had the budget of my purchase bill! The acting was just as bad ... I've seen better acting in pornographic films. I would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life behind. In fact, I registered in IMDb so that other people do not get caught by seeing this as I did. But do not get me wrong, I love science fiction movies! This was more like the introduction of a video game :( I'm glad I spent only a dollar to see this! The story line reminded me of the black-hued movie, A Prisoner on a Ship in Outer Space Escapes My God ... what are we going to do? I would not even let him play in the back of my house while he was cleaning! The important thing here is that you can do better.
