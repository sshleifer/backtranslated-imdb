One Night at McCool's wants you to think it's a modern, intelligent black comedy. He presses his "extravagant" characters and "outrageous" situations on the spectator like a croupier who does extraordinary hours. The premise is about a female gold digger, called Jewel, who goes out with men to steal and, sometimes, murder, so that she can have all the mundane possessions she so desires. You know, this would not be a bad strategy if it persecuted the rich. This movie really wants you to believe that a cunning con man would waste time hanging out with waiters and Andrew "Says" Clay. Please. That major flaw in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment found in this stench (and that's not intentional). Seeing it, it is not hard to believe that there could be a good movie inside of her somewhere. One night at McCool's I just could not decide which direction I wanted to take, so I just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. Try to be sexy but do not take off your clothes with the camera, and the few scenes of the head of the body are terribly pedestrian. There is a recurring scene in which a hit man asks the protagonist (played by Matt Dillon) about what sex is like with Jewel. It seems that Matt does not know, nor the spectators. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool's also wants to be fun. Sorry, the strange coincidences and misunderstandings did not even work at Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed to go for a dark environment to accompany his comedy. Something like a Coen brothers movie, but his superficial script could not touch with subtlety, nor his dazzling guided hammer in any blow. What remains of the audience is a movie that seems to be busy trying to please everyone and simply lose the attraction on the way.
