This movie is a low budget real production, but I will not say anything more about that, since it has already been covered. I give this movie a low grade just for the story, but I met the director the night I saw the movie and he gave me an additional reason why I did not like the movie. He asked me how I enjoyed it and I told him it was not easy to like it. My main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced that they were close. I also told him that the scene in which the main characters were presented when the children became friends was too late in the film. <br /> <br /> He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. That they added because he felt that I had made the two main characters not appear nearby. He went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed for their satisfaction as they ran out of money. I agree that they did not do much for the movie. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the film, of which I was not aware, is that the actor who had the lead role wrote the script based on his own personal experience. This is usually a bad move, since some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction of the viewer. The story is so close to home that the writer makes too many assumptions about the reaction of the audience to their own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it did not work for me, since I never became interested in any of the characters, let alone the protagonist. What was presented were two evil people to make money by any means, regardless of who gets hurt. When Ms. Young's character decides to give up the mistreatment, it seems that she does it because it is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing something wrong. If the movie has a message, I suspect that only the writer knows.
