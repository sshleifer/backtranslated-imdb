In the first place, nobody with experience in the application of the law (neither ER nor EMT, but the application of the real law) takes this show seriously. Walker would be expelled from any police force in the USA. UU For his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. Besides that, he is a comic character: he has no capacity to act, incredibly trite lines, there is no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how silly blondes are. And Trivett is the last black-faced clown. Come on, if you think Walker is a sincere show without prejudice, then explain why JT is treated like an imbecile, always the subject of Walker's jokes, never allowed to be the only one to solve the crime and never rescues Walker . , that he should be dead 50 times more for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even more foolish than the detectives who persecute them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirty ones), the smart guys Walker faces never seem to understand that, once that Walker is captured The imbecile needs to be put out of his misery. But again, Norris produced the show and starred in it, so how could he voluntarily rid himself of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are? As if six boys waited to take him one by one. What a terrible series! It's more degrading than any of the hokey westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, although I guess most of you here are too young to remember those shows. But just like those programs, in the same way as those programs, Walker TR is just as insulting and just plain silly.
