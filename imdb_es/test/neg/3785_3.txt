So this guy goes to a psychiatrist's office for his first date. Once the paperwork is finished, the psychiatrist says, "I'm going to show you ink stains, tell me what you see in them." "Well, says the patient," looking at the first, "I see a man and a woman having sex." Seeing the second, he says: "I see two women having sex." When he sees the third one, he says: "I see two men having sex". When he sees the next one, he says: "I see two men and two women having sex." The psychiatrist leaves the ink spots. "Then," he says, "we'll start talking about your monomania." "My monomania?" says the boy "And you with all these dirty photos!" This is how this film strikes me.
