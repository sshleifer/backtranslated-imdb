Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is more bad and strong too. However, most of the performance is also bad, as in the first. Sometimes the characters say things that do not make sense and are not convincing. I made a mistake when I saw this sober. You probably enjoy it more if you're not ;-). If you did not stop loving the clowns after the first movie, you will definitely do it after the second ... And what a coincidence, his car broke down right in the middle of a forest and ... at night? That is your luck. They find a house and one was shot, one of the observers is left behind (why I do not know) and the rest finally finds another house. In that house lives a voodoo priestess ... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. So, who is? Well, better watch the movie and discover for yourself ...
