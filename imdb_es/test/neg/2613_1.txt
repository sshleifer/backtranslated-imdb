You know, I'm sure the guys were sitting in the office one day and they said, "HOW CAN WE EARN MORE MONEY?" They had made all the possible toy variants they could make with their current characters. So they decide, we steal the idea of ​​Star Wars, A PREQUELER, and we can invent all the new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally something they did in Puppet Master 3, but who cares? Anyway, they choose a point in time before the first film in which Toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting around, and a wooden head rolls on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a member of the dead family or something like that. It does not matter This is how the puppet teacher's ancestry story begins. It's long, it's boring, nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is that they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie, but they do not give clues to their destiny. So, guess what, once the proceeds of the new toys pay off, they can fund a new (and 4th consecutive time) sequel, called "PUPPET MASTER 8 THE SEQUEL TO THE PREQUEL OF THE FATE OF THE DEAD RETRO PUPPETS!" Hold your breath!
