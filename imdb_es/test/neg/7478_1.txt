For a while, when I was in the middle of work, I had the habit of watching all the nightly talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... Until I arrived at 1:30 a.m. The time between Conan and X-Files, in SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and interestingly still is) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> Your show intrigued me at the beginning. Young, dressed casually and with the modern pedigree of an MTV presenter, I thought that Carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late into the night. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> He does not have comedy time. His jokes are not funny, and his monologue is a painful matter of shy babblings. I began to think that I simply was not able to offer comedy (and I'm right, it's not), but over time it became clear that the writers of the show should take that into account. The writing was idiotic and too exaggerated and the parodies shouted badly. And towards the end of the series in the studio, the writers made Carson drink alcohol in the series with gusto in each presentation, Carson, who did not pay attention, smiled from the gaunt cheek to the emaciated cheek as he made his way through of the interviews. <br /> <Br /> Zero interview skills. Any. Try to be friendly / talkative, but end up being rude and rude. He talks too much He cuts his guests. He asks them rude or shameful questions, if he can find a question to ask them. And as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally looked at him or twisted in their seats, clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the program has left the studio and it seems that it was filmed on a camera by hand. Still, Carson refuses to accept the insinuation of NBC. At one point, Carson did not even get a cameraman, he had to film for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... that writing is all over the wall. <br /> <br /> I see that the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that that is the reason why he is still in the air, he pays for it himself.
