Terrible direction of a horrible script. Even the DVD seemed muddy and out of focus. Accents laughable throughout the map. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea that these were children in love in the mud, but that fact was immediately evident from the initial scene and all the love shots of naked or unclothed youth, usually wet or shining with sweat, looking at each other with nostalgia.
