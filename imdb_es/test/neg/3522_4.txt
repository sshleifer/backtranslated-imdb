This movie is so smooth! I tried not to expect anything better from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. This could have been much better. The characters are really simple, without any depth. It is a pity that the talented artists Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen have not improved the already poor characters. The director simply does not emotionally involve the observer with this piece of cr * p. <br /> <br /> And the chase sequence at the end of the movie. It is awful! <br /> <br /> Why did there have to be such a stupid and old solution for that situation? <br /> <br /> It is an element too used with an even more terrible way of filming it. OH NO!
