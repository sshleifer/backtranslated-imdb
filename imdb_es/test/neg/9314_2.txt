What can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was filmed with television cameras, and whether that was due to presumption or budget limitations does not facilitate the observation of this variation on a theme of Romero. They reminded me constantly that I was watching someone's school project, at best, and at worst, cheap. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with archival footage, but that says more about his editing style than about his management style, which consists of direct approaches with television cameras, which made me think I was watching public access television instead of a real and honest movie. br /> <br /> The story copies and pastes fragments and pieces from various sources, including Romero's DEAD trilogy mentioned above, THE ROAD WARRIOR (discovers the footage of a "future" that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> The results are worth one hour and no zombies that track and eat humans. (Okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that does not change anything, it's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031, and the first chain of people who were cloned nineteen years before they have started to malfunction, particularly in the dietary area. Of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they like is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It's not safe to be inside, it's not safe to be outside. It's only a matter of time before ghouls who eat meat devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I do not care if people cheat Romero, if it's done well, but a new territory is not covered in this movie. It is THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, filmed with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD cover makes it look like it was shot, at least, with an 8mm film. This would not have been a problem for me if the story had not been so cheap. The film offers a grim vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movies?
