This movie was painfully horrible. Most of the film consisted of people running through the woods, walking through the woods or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then, two children who discover two horribly mutilated bodies in the forest, return to the forest the next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no continuity of time. His day, his night, his day, really his night, his darkness, his black tone, his day. All the wood scenes continue like this until you think you will lose your mind. Very bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw footprint embedded in the forest floor and theorizes that a super-large alligator may have learned to walk upright. Actually a silly movie with no real motivation written for the characters. It could be entertaining for small children, as an alternative to really graphic things.
