This movie seems to be well done, and more efforts should be made to promote women's films. Apart from that, this film is also deeply disturbing because it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character who is deeply disturbed. If you've seen any of the promotional materials, you might think that this is a moving movie about a relationship that has come to an end, but none of that suggests how disturbing the central premise is: <br /> <br /> A woman threatens to commit suicide, unless your ex soon agrees to relive here the most precious memories of your relationship. When told how unfair (to say the least) this threat is, Tessa (the supposed protagonist) suggests that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Eh? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover to stay, and convinces him to adopt a sexual orientation behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) while assuring her that "this is not sex". <br /> <br /> Reverse to the genres, have the protagonists played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green, and this could be a feature film on Lifetime with a title like "Hostage to Obsession". There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that encompasses Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> Supports Kristen Thomson for playing a psychotic from the border line, former manipulator to a T, maybe too well because there is not a well-adjusted person, man or woman, who can see this and Do not have chills on your spine.
