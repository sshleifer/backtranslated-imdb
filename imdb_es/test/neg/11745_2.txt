* Some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, you can not expect this movie to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of the best Hitchcock films, Psycho, could have been much better. <br /> <br /> First of all, whoever launched the movie must have been a psychopath. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What do they think? Unlike the "harmless" Bates, almost childlike, that Anthony Perkins could portray, Vaughn seems like he could be a murderer. In an effort to make Bates look innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay. Many of the other actors also did not seem to fit into their parts, including Julianne Moore, who just did not seem to fit into the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the atrocious cast, the cinematography is notably in disrepair, despite the fact that they remade the scene from film to scene. All they added were random shots of objects, like clouds or a naked woman, between the shots of murdered characters. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot anyway and, in turn, they made no sense. <br /> <br /> In general, this new version of Psycho, which could be a decent image, turned out to be a complete waste of time. .
