My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... Because I've seen this. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First, how do you rate yourself so high? I can not understand that. This "show" is filled to the top with annoying people, stupid people or just plain nasty. The "gags" are horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode in which the wife of Earl's brother got wrapped and washed with dead fish. I'm not joking. That was not funny, that's repulsive. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid) then had sex. I almost vomit. <br /> <br /> This has been one of the most desperate comedy attempts in a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but he is caught in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy". <br /> <br /> Earl is now in jail for this current season. Let's hope he gets the chair just so this show ends with his misery. <br /> <br /> The last word: this show would be fun for people who think that Larry the Cable is fun. For the rest of the world, IT IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY. Avoid like the plague.
