I kept seeing him because it seemed that the plot was going somewhere. When he arrived ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe he does not. Maybe I'm just implying that something will happen. The writers lacked imagination. This is not a "B" movie, it is made for the TV movie "B".
