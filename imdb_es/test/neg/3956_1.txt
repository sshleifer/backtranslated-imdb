I have not laughed so much in a theater in years. The only problem is that the intention of the film was not to make my laughter slip by laughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely full of bad CGI, absolutely terrible duologist, absolutely terrible * acting * and enough geeky references for everything to come out as nothing more than a full cheese. <br /> <br /> As a player and a geek-type girl, I recognized all the obvious references to the game in this movie, as well as the STUFF geek that launched itself into the background as a candy for the eye (the Steamboy poster, the shirts from thinkgeek.com and j-list.com), and that did not redeem the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have been good at EVERYTHING was the ghost-like characters that were intentionally made wrong in CGI to make it look like they were from a game, and that they were stolen OBVIOUSLY from Japanese horror movies . <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilariously bad, and something I would expect from a midnight screening of a science fiction channel made for television. movie. Do not expect more than that and you'll have a great time. Just do not drink a soda or spit it out everywhere when you have good lines like: "Why did you bring that game to our lives? WHY?!"
