Today You Die starts as a sinister bank. The sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) hires Harlan's honor banks (producer Steven Seagal) to drive a security vehicle with $ 20,000,000 of cash in the back from point "A", a Las Vegas casino up the point "B" him, sounds simple right? Well, what Max forgot to tell Harlan is that the money was stolen and that he just became the driver of the escape in an armed robbery. they get even worse for Harlan when the local police catch him and throw him in jail for a long time, however, Harlan managed to hide the money before he got caught and with a nice $ 20,000,000 stake and not counted, Harlan has They take care of their back as the thieves want it, as do the government agents Harlan joins Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison and both manage to escape, at which time Harlan seeks revenge. .. <br /> <br /> Photographed and directed by Don E FauntLeRoy, one has to say that you take them in the action films directly in Eastern European video in which Steven Seagal specializes these days are not improving and Today You Die is a good example. This is a terrible movie, as simple as that really. The screenplay by producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new type of character to develop his nonexistent acting skills, that of a criminal instead of a government / police / soldier / clich√© army man that usually interpret. In fact, if you were being charitable, you could say that Today You Die is a scam of Mel Gibson's excellent Payback thriller (1998), where he also played a really nasty job with such good results. While Payback was a high-quality action and suspense movie with no borders and no concessions, Today You Die is nothing insignificant by comparison. Unfortunately, here Seagal is terrible, he also has no presence on the screen or threat and the public is never sure if it is destined to be a bad guy that we hate or not. For example, initially his character is configured as a modern Robin Hood while stealing the rich drug dealers and unhinged to give to the poor (in addition to keeping an orderly profit for himself) that is simply ridiculous in itself but then has Seagal He turned around and murdered many people, which contradicts a sympathetic criminal with the moral that the film tried so hard to start. The story is full of holes, for example, agent Knowles is contacted by Harlan in the race and then is reprimanded by his superior bent for meeting him and it turns out that he discovered him touching his phone. In that case, why did not his boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? The story is the usual boring soft and predictable fight over a lot of money with surprise. The government agent who investigates is really a bad guy! Wow, I did not see it coming. I must say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snail rhythm and Today You Die feels like it's forever, action scenes and set-pieces are also seriously lacking in value of entertainment. The infrequent fight scenes are not great, most are filmed in the shade, cut and edited very quickly or with the camera reproduced behind the character of Seagal to try and disguise the fact that most of the work done here is for double. Once again, Seagal looks fat and out of shape and wears long, baggy coats to try to hide it, but she does not. At first, there is a very nice car chase through the streets of Las Vegas. I thought that Today You Die could be fine, but it seems that the whole sequence was stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997) that deals with a robbery in a casino in Las Vegas, as well as the use of images of that Today You Die movie also edits scenes from Charlie Sheen's action film No Code of Conduct (1998), Jean-Claude Van Damme's action film The Order (2001) and Wesley The action movie based on Snipes prison , Undisputed (2002), so the amount of Today You Die images is original is a guess. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine, considering that it is edited from four separate films, so own images are only competent and consistent enough. Obviously, all the images of places in the United States are removed from the aforementioned films, with all the original images taken at low cost in Bulgaria. The rap-style music that fouls Today You Die is horrible, by the way. The acting is poor and Seagal simply mutters between his lines as usual. <br /> <br /> Today You Die is a really bad movie made from other bad action movies. Seagal seems old and fat, the action scenes are average at best and most of the story is quite random and in the end it does not match so well. One to avoid, unless you're a Seagal fan, if that animal exists ...
