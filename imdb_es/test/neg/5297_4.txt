Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" turns out to be a disappointing sequel to the ingenious and intelligent "Get Shorty" of 1995. <br /> <br / > Travolta offers a pleasant enough performance in this slightly entertaining film, but ultimately, the film fails due to an underdeveloped plot, unpleasant characters and a surprising lack of chemistry between the drivers of Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this example of ungraceful dialogue (which appeared frequently in the trailers) says it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hi, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The movie suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is gangster or aspires to be gangster, comparing it to organized crime. In "Get Shorty," the premise of a gangster "becoming legitimate" when getting into the movies was a clever idea to get the water out, but in "Be Cool", it seems that the business has completely twisted since then. <Br /> <br /> The film is interpreted in an interesting way and the highlight is a "monolgue" delivered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor and a bully, where he recreates a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst of "Dale." The character of Vince Vaughan thinks he is black and that he is often seen dressed as a pimp. This was quite funny in the first scene that presents it and gets tired and embarrassed almost immediately afterwards. <br /> <br /> In general, "Be Cool" may be worth renting for John Travolta at full speed (of which I am one), but you may want to keep your finger near the fast forward button to pass without feeling that you have wasted too much time. Fans of "Get Shorty" may want to avoid this, since the sequel is devoid of most of the things that made it a winner. I rate this movie as a hard truth 4/10.
