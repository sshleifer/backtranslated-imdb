It is quite rare that a movie appears that is so useless, that with IMDb I allowed the use of negative scores. In fact, I reflect again on this film and I really can not think of a movie that had so little in its favor. Acting: Your right to Kidding. Direction: No. A plot: No. This movie has nothing to do with it being taken as a serious film, this is often the case with films of this genre, but most films of this nature can be seen as if they were a movie. Comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic characters and situations are and almost make your time worthwhile. This movie is so empty, it can not even adapt to that purpose. I have to give this a -1/10, three points less than any other movie I have rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes I spent watching it. I really do not have the words to describe how bad this is. No one should ever see this again for any reason.
