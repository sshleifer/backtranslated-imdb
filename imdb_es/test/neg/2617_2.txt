Retro Puppet Master is complete and complete CRAP. In particular, the puppets look stupid and disgusting. The performance was unforgivable and the story was stale. This film goes back to the past, where the dolls were created, not the Puppet Master. .Retro Puppet Master is classified as PG-13, the first Puppet Master rated PG-13. The film does not contain horror or suspense. The fact that this movie was a Puppet Master movie surprises the mind, because this installment does not have the blood cubes, good acting or any entertainment as the previous films did. Do not watch this movie, do not rent it and do not even see it on TV, because this movie is out of style, it's not violent and it's completely horrible. of 10. As a Puppet Master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
