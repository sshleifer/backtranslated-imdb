Why did you unleash this film on us? It seems as if they were willing to make this movie a total slap in the face to Anne Rice and all the Vampire Chronicles fans who respect each other. Ignores the fieldwork established by Interview with the vampire, mutilates the plot of the novel and causes Stuart Townsend to stumble upon drunks. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our little prince, our rebellious adventurer with the most immense sense of humor. Stuart is a second-class theft, bored of Dracula in black leather. He did not read the books or meet the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still made a point to read the books and meet and love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, it's not an "Independent" vampire movie, it's garbage and it's simple.
