All those who are in the culture of the PC are horrified by the dogmatic Christian vision of this film, claiming that it contains racist ideation and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care about this, but are oriented The values ​​of dazzling production and competent acting are dismayed by the lack of such values ​​here. <br /> <br /> Those who denounce both of these are apoplectic that this production was left to the general public, as evidenced in the comments here. <br /> <br /> What is an interesting premise, which is not original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is treated quite immature in this film, but it is done with pleasure. What the crew and the actors lacked sensitivity, professional skills and technical experience are counteracted by the intensity they show. <br /> <br /> It is not as bad as many people think here, and it would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to provoke laughter and moans. However, it is deployed with enough intensity to maintain interest throughout the process, and is on par with an entry produced by Corman from his first work period, or material from Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $ 2 (or less) like me, you will not be disappointed, but you wish you could have an opinion on how it was done.
