I'm a fan of the horror films of the 50s and 60s, such ridiculous and silly movies that are good for laughing. So, because of this, it's natural for me to choose this movie, especially because with John Agar in it, it's almost guaranteed to be bad. Unfortunately, although it was a bad movie, it was the worst kind of bad movie: beyond the credible and without grace. At least with the stupid and exaggerated bad movies, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and the terrible direction and acting. Here, you really never see that much of the monster (mainly due to the darkness of the impression) and the acting, although bad, is more bad bad energy ... apathetic and boring. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some young adults who go to the hollow of Satan up to their necks. Well, considering the name of the place, it is not surprising that they are later chewed up in pieces! Duh ... do not go kissing in the hollow of Satan! Well, there are reports of some type of object crashing from the sky, so what do teenagers do? Yes, it organizes a dance party, a dance party very, very, very slow, where children almost dance in slow motion. So it's up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to make sure that the teenagers can dance in peace without fear of chewing. <br /> <br /> As for the monster, it's a guy with a gorilla suit and a silly mask. - A bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high technology. To make matters worse, he snorts and moves very, very slowly, so slowly that even the heaviest teenager could easily get over it! The way he manages to kill repeatedly overcomes me. <br /> <br /> In general, too boring to like, even if you're a lousy movie fanatic.
