This movie is so boring that I spent half of it in IMDb while it was open in another Netflix tab, trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the most boring, heavy and sophisticated movies I had ever seen. One caveat: I really could not finish it, so these are my impressions until the 54th minute. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets a lot of screen time. As others have mentioned, his mother wrote the script (perhaps during some kind of drug-induced stupor in which the follies and emotionless statements about emotions sounded like an interesting dialogue) and it seems that the movie is a showcase for Knightly . Ups! Although I agree that she is lovely (with her teeth not exposed ... her teeth with small pieces cause me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and badly synchronized. As in, William or Dylan do something nice ... pause ... K HAHAHA with dimples and a playful arm stroke. About a minute too late. What? And she can not match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. Somehow he manages to really look at her and seem to be fascinated by her and falling in love with her, while she seems to be totally disconnected, almost as if she were interacting with a mirror. That must be a torture, act in front of someone who is not delivering the same level of energy as you. Do you know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> Knightly looks stunning during her cyclic "I have curls from 1940 and a warm dress. Watch me sing!" shots, but what is the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she speaks, it's weird, "Oow, Mehster Deelan, where are you going?" This confuses me because the accent is so confusing and not authentic, but so dense sometimes I have no idea what he is saying (or maybe he fell asleep). If nobody knows who Vera was or what does it matter, or few know, was it so important to give this supposed Welsh accent? He gets distracted from all the rest of the action (kidding). <br /> <br /> This movie seems as if someone had dreamed of a movie, maybe after reading a bit of Dylan Thomas before going to bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world it was like, "Man, that dream was very interesting" and tried to replicate it. Then someone else warned: "Your script needs work, nothing that happens advances a story or creates a need" and the writer is everything, "But that's how I dreamed it!" It's like a child's fantasy, one of those wild and sinuous threads that turn to get your attention. AND THEN William went to war and then Vera had a baby and then a blonde girl drank too much and there were a lot of planes and curls and they all had ruby ​​red lips and ... <br /> <br /> Regarding the character of Dylan Thomas (so bland that is all I can call him), why did not he have any line in this silly biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and go around with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that she will do a somersault in public. Get out of here, crazy poets! (I realize that she is not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this nauseating unit of crazy people who have gone crazy, like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart). Someone asks in the forum if they should buy this movie. . I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and only use it as a weapon to drug children, the elderly or guests of the house. <br /> <br /> P.S. Murphy's character ... when someone asks if you're "in the shit **", you can say yes, because your war scenes seem to have been filmed in a sanitary landfill.
