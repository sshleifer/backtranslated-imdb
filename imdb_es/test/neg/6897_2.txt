... I usually hate puns, but this seems to be the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I suspect that I am not the first. And I'm sure many, MANY comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. It certainly bothered me from the beginning. But there is much more evil in this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I were a father, I would be irritated by the violent turn that takes almost the end in the confrontation with the coyotes. (Although for me, at least he injected some action). And from a conventional screen writing point of view, coyotes could be expected to play a more important role in the conflict (Gee, you have a "widow" cow ... Maybe your "husband" was killed by coyotes? No ... there is a much more foolish explanation, and what kind of farm is this? Otis is committed to protecting all animals from harm, but there certainly does not seem to be any threat from humans. the farmer is vegan, but why does he raise pigs? In all the stories of animals for children: Babe, Charlotte's Web, whatever ... the reality of life on the farm is, at least, mentioned. friendly farmer is carrying some kind of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this, but it is never explained), but all the farmer receives is the abuse of a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny, but he left me. thinking seriously if he was going to end up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what the hell is the deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without the gag of the ball. <br /> <br /> Add some really horrible attempts at emotional scenes, an almost total lack of laughs, and THOSE UDDERS, and it has the worst children movie I've seen in a long time. In general, I only publish in IMDb to highlight a film that is not as well known, not to criticize the current box office success # 2. But this movie angered me. I was occupying space in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. This summer there has been a lot of good family entertainment, in fact, there were at least 2 more movies for children in the same multiplex. But I can not see something like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can fool families with an extra $ 30. At least I had a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that my 35 years without children, this movie was not designed for me. But there is simply no excuse for a childish film as lazy and terrible as "Barnyard" in the Pixar era. I was bored by the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly did not make me angry like "Barnyard". "The shark story" was a weak attempt at laziness on the street, but he had a few laughs. In that case, you can activate Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent, so you should be ashamed to put your name on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I'm giving you 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically funny, and Maria Bamford had some fun lines like the farmers' wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmer. They really did not explain who she was. They did not explain many things. Especially not why Sam Elliot, the definitive "man of man", had an udder moving around. Horrifying.
