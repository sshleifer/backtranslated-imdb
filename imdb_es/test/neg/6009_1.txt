This is by far the worst adaptation of Hemingway. Rock Hudson was very bad and completely amazing as a soldier / adventurer bitten by the war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her part and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think that she was acting in some other movie. They tried to make a large-scale epic of a low-key romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if that were not enough, everything is so slow, too long and outdated that you can hardly see it. Rock must have kicked himself for rejecting "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to do this horrible shit. <br /> <br /> 0/10. Be avoided
