Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first comments were, obviously, from people who had an interest in the film or friends / relatives who had an interest in the film, and that's fine: if I had made a movie, all of my family and friends would also be there to congratulate him. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, bad things are much greater than good things. Well: the general plot was slightly interesting. The music in general was quite good. Several of the songs (when you could listen to them) were really great. The only musical problems I had were: # 1) the first suspense scene with some kind of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to take away the suspense), # 2) the song that is playing when the main characters went to an outdoor party in a friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while Danny Trejo hung a man (it sounded like a very good song, but it should have broken down through the scene when Danny Trejo got frog). Now, for completely bad things: the script was atrocious. I mean, horrible. I've seen a softer dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Advice for the writer of a part-time writer and full-time movie aficionado: When writing a dialogue, ask yourself: "Is this something that people would really say?" Honestly, the script was laughable. I want to close the performance, but with that kind of writing, it is difficult to know if they have talent or not. The slightly interesting plot was severely hampered by the crappy dialogue. I know it was low budget, but words do not cost money; If you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can do it. This movie did not seem to have it either, but I hope the director has a second chance to make a better movie.
