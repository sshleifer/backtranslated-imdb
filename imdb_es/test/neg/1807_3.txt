Review of the movie The Heart of Darkness Could a book that is well known for its eloquent writing and complicated concepts ever turn into a film good enough to represent the deep meaning of the book? So far, that goal has not been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was attempted to become a movie in 1993, but it was a failure compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It's hard enough to turn any book into a movie. There is always the concern that it is not so descriptive or that it has the same meaning. So, why does the novel, The Heart of Darkness, become a movie? I have no idea. There is so much description and meaning hidden throughout the book. When I have just read the words clearly, I think that a person would think that it is quite boring and would not get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the movie; The film just brushed the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie did not even follow the full story of the book, important changes were made that I thought made the movie worse. For example, the manager did not follow the boat with Marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy did. I think that eliminated some important plots and eliminated the manager's great deception in relation to Kurtz. Also, Kurtz was not even on the steamboat when he died, which especially made the whole trip even more useless, which became annoying after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fianc√©e about his last moments and words, it was not so descriptive or important, the fiancee did not even bother so much. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performance, none The actors did a very good job, except the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very evil, and that was something important in the book. In addition, other characters such as Marlow, the manager and the groom did not do justice to the characters they deserved from the book. His performance was not very exciting or memorable at all. In general, I do not think that this book should have been tried to turn it into a movie. I think it's okay to use some of the themes in a different story line, like in Apocalypse Now. But as for following the exact same plot of the book, it's a shame.
