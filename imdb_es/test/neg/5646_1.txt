Have you ever noticed how so many really bad films attract so many 10/10 votes? There's not much of a riddle in how that happens, but this is not much of a movie. There are two ways to see how it is delivered in the Mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can not complain much. 2. It's free, so it can not be very good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in Sunday papers is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away. They are the ones who have been out for a long time and have made most of the money they will ever earn, so it is a case that something else is a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad this must be by skipping TV and DVD rentals. Derek Jacobi is as good as Dickens. The negative points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as being successful for the poor vagabond Vinnie and Jacobi, the other is the talkative ham that has been fired. The story is very weak. The story of Dickens has nothing to do with the murders of the film and it feels as if another movie has been slapped on the script to make people think he is a British Dan Brown without religion. The supporting cast is there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave must be really tough) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie taking his priceless Dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. It's not funny and not very good even for free.
