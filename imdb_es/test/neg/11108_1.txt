This is another original Sci-Fi movie that looks at Rhys Davies, where it's hard to decide what's worse, acting, or writing / directing / producing (John Sheppherd the three at the helm). a cargo container on board a cruiser that escapes and begins the bloodbath. Sci-fi clich√© of the robust captain with the beautiful daughter, the handsome hero and the mad scientist. Captian claims a terrorist alert for the ship (since, of course, he would not believe a monstrous story). Here there is a dramatic drop of helicopters from the Navy Seals. The budget only allowed the entire force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ship on board. Puleeze Also the computer animation of the ship could improve on your computer. I also loved it when the Commander of the Seal who looked through standard binoculars from ten miles away could see three people jump out of the boat. If the science fiction channel is going to continue with the original films, I hope they realize that the audience is not at the kindergarten level and that they buy better scripts and directors. If you went straight to the video, you would find it in the 99 cents container.
