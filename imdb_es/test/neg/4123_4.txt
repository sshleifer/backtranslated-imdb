I just watched this movie and I must say it was a good movie. I loved some of the good ones and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had some holes. <br /> <br /> The name of the people was something like ... stupid ... I think people should have sued the manufacturer of this movie because it was so boring at the end ... the first half Time was good, but then it went on and on and on. I was happy ... it was over ... but I still loved the killer robot and some of the good guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best two dollars I've spent because I do like the stupid b-movie like this and let's go ... it's a b-movie for everyone.
