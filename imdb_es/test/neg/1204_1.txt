A teenage boy, who is not in the military and has not trained to be an airplane pilot, goes to a foreign country to rescue his father. If this is not ridiculous enough, talk to an Air Force Colonel to help him get his hands on a plane [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel risks his career and his life by helping the brave boy. Not only do they not make the Colonels continue like this, but they never did. This corny and cheesy movie should be released on the air and eliminated with a MIG.
