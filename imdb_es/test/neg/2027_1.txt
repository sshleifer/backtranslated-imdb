I found this DVD in the store and I thought, why not support an indy movie and watch a great horror movie? Please save time and money and this happens. The acting, the script, practically everything with this movie is sub par. There really is not much history, and there is no character development. I realized that I did not care what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened. Everyone is supposed to be college age, but they all look like in their mid-thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who seems to be pushing at 40. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that each scene is shown in a master shot. There is no editing, no cuts or close ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
