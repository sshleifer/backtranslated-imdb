Last night I saw a show at 12:45 a.m. and I would have walked 20 minutes. in, but there was nowhere to go! Brazen product placement, juvenile scripts, so much wasted talent, attacks against homosexuals ... what did not they do? The movie is also incredibly long (we left at 3). As a person who seldom pays the full price at the movies, imagine that my disgust pays $ 22 for this self-indulgent petty nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today still feeling depressed, and I have not been able to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed directly lost in this thing, like me. When Cedric the Entertainer is the highest brand (a man so little entertained that he has to call himself "the Entertainer", so he understands what he thinks he is doing), you have a serious problem. In addition, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is terrifying, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they have been polishing this turd. This film is cruel to the bitter end. We were left alone to make sure they did not give Robert an "In Memory", which they did not. Save! Save your money! Save your soul!
