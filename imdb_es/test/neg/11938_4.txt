I really wanted to love this movie, and not only because I had Aaron Eckhart in it, but I thought the premise would be great because I enjoy movies and shows that revolve around chefs. The cinematography was good, but besides being turned around the chefs, everything else is simply a clich√©. Oh, and little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie, although Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit irritating in all the movies she is in, because she plays many roles in which she complains. It has some decent kitchen flashes, but the food did not really play a big part in the film of what I expected, which was a big disappointment to me. This movie had good potential, the cast was great, but they only had very little to work with. I like a good romantic happy comedy but this was simply bland. And more than it should be because it feels much longer than it is. It's not a terrible movie, you will not miss anything by not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
