Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely talented and versatile singer. His performance in this film is more than competent and, from my point of view, about the only redeeming form of this film. She captures very gently the essence of the lonely singer with a serious health problem. However, what disgusts me greatly about the film is the shameless placement of products for a well-known chain of French hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to meander for a long time without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note, you can argue that the movie is not predictable but you can also say that it is boring due to lack of cohesion. There are some good pictures in the movie, you can not stop thinking that all the parts just do not add up. It really is a shame because Kaas really shines in this movie.
