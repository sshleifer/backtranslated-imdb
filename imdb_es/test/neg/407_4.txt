In a way, we have to respect Arachnia. It is clearly thought of as a tribute to the great bugs films of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; At least the movie does not present CGI. However on the other hand; You can not respect the movie too much because it's a lot of garbage. The acting is terrible, special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider explode; You've seen them all, so they get bored pretty fast. The plot follows a group of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which turns out to be a house where a man has a huge spider that he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidentally, at the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from the ground. All the characters in this movie are poor cartoons; none of them has anything that looks like a third dimension and they will soon begin to bore you completely. You have to feel for director Brett Piper, since he clearly did not have much to work with for this film; but that does not make Arachnia worthwhile, and in general there are better giant bugs films than this, and therefore Arachnia does not have my seal of approval.
