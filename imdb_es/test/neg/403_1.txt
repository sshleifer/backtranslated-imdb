This is one of those movies that you see because it's bad. A movie that you watch only to see your craft skills. Supposedly a horror, I can not imagine how anyone can fear a claymation bug, especially one of translucent nature where you can see the actor's legs behind. <br /> <br /> Even without a budget, a little attention to detail and even an attempt to make this film credible would have taken away the fun, as they would have had to replace all the actors and the whole story . If I had nothing to cheat about while I was playing, I would have stopped him after 10 minutes, and I would have put on a quality program like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. that Brett Piper gets with Quintin Terrantino and Really pumps some stools. <br /> <br /> :)
