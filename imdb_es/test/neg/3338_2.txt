I'm used to being patient with movies because, in general, I think it's generally worth it. But some works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation ... "Last year in Marienbad" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "Last year in Marienbad". I can count on one hand the number of films that I have left aside over the years. "Pola X" achieved membership in that group in August. In my defense, I think I made a brave effort to defend my position, waiting for things to turn around. However, I finally threw in the towel just below the 90 minute mark, quite respectable in these circumstances. "Pola X" does not come close to the promise of Carax's previous work. After a break of 10 years, that must have been bitter for him. Melville keeps turning in his grave!
