I did not see this movie when it came out originally, but there have been a couple of songs that share the title and the term is still used from time to time and I thought there must be something in the movie, so I dug it up and gave a view Now I would like to recover the approximate hour and forty-five minutes of my life (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad in the movie, the acting was good, there were no big holes in the plot, of course there was not much plot to have holes. There just was not much in the movie. There was a certain chemistry between the two, but nothing convincing about their relationship; Nothing interesting about its history. Near the end, when he tries to chase the train to catch his fugitive romance, neither my wife nor I wanted him to catch her. Honestly, we realized that they were better off with each other and if they were together again we really did not care. So, what does that say about this love story when even a sappy 25-year-old romantic like my wife did not have an emotional investment in the relationship? I should have left this in the "lost" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
