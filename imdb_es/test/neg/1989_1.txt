This movie is worse than "the door of heaven" or "plan 9 of outer space". I do not know why he got a single Oscar, he should have received a million raspberries, as well as the audiences that left or did not appear in the first place. The Hospital was a financial failure of the first order, but I am sure that the elite classes of the leftist and open-minded intellectuals criticized that the American public was too plebeian to appreciate the social commentaries when they saw it, and so on. and in. George C Scott, in one of the most naive and shameful roles, along with the aging sex symbol Diana Rigg, spends most of the movie trying to criticize in an increasingly carefree way as they move into an absurd plot. Poor George is impotent and he's just crushed by the event, but after a lot of dirty language between him and Rigg, he rapes her several times on a lovely night in a dirty, crumbling New York hospital that looks so unpleasant that he would not want a Dying pet rat treated on it. There are also some sacrilegious junk dialogues thrown here and there, filled with a lot of insults too. It ends by portraying the defective notion that unusual stress without physical effort always causes a cardiac arrest. I never want to see another minute of this horrible movie again.
