Irwin Allen's first foray into a star show was a star disaster. The history of humanity contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia May as the blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the landscape with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the stage for weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow by Marilyn Monroe, just a few of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known to be the last film he presented to the three Marx Brothers, although they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is the confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho eucres the Indians of the island of Manhattan as Peter Minuit, and the most amazing of all, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity when an apple defeats him . <br /> <br /> Keeping all these representations together is a story where humanity itself is being judged. A Super H bomb is about to be discovered and left loose in the world population. The Day of Judgment is approaching. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its defenders and detractors. Speaking on behalf of the prosecution is Old Scratch, who has brought out the worst of man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man also has his good side and who is better than Ronald Colman to prove man in his best civilized form. Colman and Price defend their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In those three people you have some of the best speaking voices the English language has ever known. When the film is about them, since each of them exposes the exhibitions for their case, it is a pleasure to listen to them. Then, when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in pain. <br /> <br /> What was Irwin Allen headed for, I'm still trying to find out. Was I deliberately camping with some of these casting decisions? If it was a satire, it just does not take off. <br /> <br /> This was Ronald Colman's farewell movie and although it's not something I'd like to leave, I can not think of anything. Man who could have declared the case of civilization better. <br /> <br /> Then, when you see The History of Mankind, move quickly through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the defenders are before the judge.
