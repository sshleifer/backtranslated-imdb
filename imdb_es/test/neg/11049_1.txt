This comment is intended primarily as a warning to people who might be attracted to the title because of its high (temporarily) user rating that seems frankly disconcerting to me. The reasons why I did not like this title are the following: <br /> <br /> 1. The manager must have had some doubts about whether to make a Jackie-Chan type film or a dark Oedipus tragedy. As a result, in terms of gender, the film falls between two stools, since the tragic and comical elements collide and cancel each other instead of forming a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motives and behaviors of the characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Unfortunately, the psychological truth and logic are lacking. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd Casting. I do not blame the actors, because it is difficult to create a convincing character acting alone, if there is little logic in the script. However, why is there an apparent age difference of approximately 15 years between the two main actors, whose ages in the film can not differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was a bad entertainment mainly because of point 2. If you can not find a character that you can sympathize with, it's hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason for what happened to the main character, it turns out that it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some films, besides being entertaining, are also stimulating. After watching this movie, I began to wonder if the idea that the director tried to provoke was not that the incestuous relationships could be perfectly healthy and pleasant. I can not put any other construction in the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is full of totally unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. The purposes may be different and I do not want to go into this broad topic. Let me say that I am not opposed to violence in movies like "Saving Private Ryan", "The Passion of the Christ" or "The Pulp Fiction". In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or auditory). For what? I do not know. Personally, I do not get any satisfaction at seeing how the teeth are extracted with a hammer or when a man cuts his tongue with scissors and then sees him drown with his own blood, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> 7. The movie reminds me a bit of Japanese porn manga in its fixation on incest and the panties of young Asian girls, when urinating and the like. It seems that there is a minority that really enjoys this kind of thing. If you are one of them, you can find this nice movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it is not stupid, it is disgusting. Do not waste your time.
