Based on a rather bland "best seller," this film, like most other Lifetime films, was portrayed more as a recreation than as a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter was not in that. The women in this do not age even in a lapse of about 20 years and the performance in general is quite bad. <br /> <br /> The characters in this one were all clich√© and one-dimensional. The story was corny in nature. I would not recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that the people who loved the book and the people who see that network all the time will think it's great. I only saw him because my girlfriend wanted to see him so he would not have to read the book that his sister had lent him. It was not made for someone like me, but my girlfriend cried a little at the end, so she did not think it was as terrible as I was.
