I'm sorry I'm sorry but I'm sorry Pretty, very good production, very good actors, also fun. But, this kind of movies with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with a private detective, with a pretty rich woman ?????????????????????? ??? Hello producer, how many movies do we have with the same plot ?????????? What do you have in mind when you make scenes like a dog that has a pupu? Or any king of that dog's activities ????? Microprocessors that can make you rich? Microprocessors who want a fortune? There are three master tabs, wow? And the creator of the chips can not make the same chips again? Hello wake up Can you give us something smarter than that? Better, D
