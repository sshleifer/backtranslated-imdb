The kind mentioned to sue for the wasted 1.5 hours of his life, I can not disagree with that. The movie started as a kind of class project, and ended up in a dark room. every time the girls were completely naked, magically, they appeared light everywhere, I know I do not write the script or I have something to say about it. But this is like a bad remake of sierra with a bad ending. Think of a man who really wrote this story, sick. This is really a shocking movie, I can not say it is horror because it is not. It is mere brutality and violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to see a movie without an end, it's like an explosion, on your face. The movie is ready, now you can go home. <br /> <br /> cons -cam-lighting (although I think I was supposed to do it) -indone -enant <br /> <br /> cons -real in your face -acting was good in my opinion -is fuck you in <br /> <br /> In general The movie is NOT my taste for the movie that the witer wanted us to know that these things happen, and the man wrote his own little fantasy. If you ever saw the movies you saw? they all had a moment of consolation in something to cling to. East ? do not. Maybe it's just me, that I'm too soft, but this movie made me tremble, and the story is very brief, the sick man kills the girls slowly. But the actors sucked you in this movie of all the screams you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, it was very quick to judge about this, is it a terrible movie? no, it's not. It is an exaggerated example of reality, this is how real it could be. But do not watch this movie if you expect a great mystery or a real plot, or even some kind of story. the man puts the girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, that's really it.
