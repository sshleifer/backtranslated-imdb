George Segal lives with his old and senile mother. There are many jokes about his dementia similar to Alzheimer's and most of them are not funny, although there were some funny moments splashed here and there (like the nude running around the park scene and the home of the elderly). At first, Segal tries to kill his mother because it is difficult to live with her and because he is a selfish man. Making the film like a comedy by Wiley Coyote against Roadrunner, in which he tries to kill this indestructible girl again and again, would have been a great success. Too bad it was NOT the general tone of the movie. <br />> I applaud Carl Reiner's attempt to make a flavourless film that aims to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND ITS DEAD MOTHER, EATING RAOUL and HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS: all the films about death that dare to offend. The problem here, however, is that WHERE IS POPPA? It has some fun moments, but it also has many shots and the product in general is incredibly smooth. In addition, issues such as homosexual rape, incest and the like are very difficult to make comedians. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" which is considered a cult movie, although I can not see anyone who wants to see this more than once.
