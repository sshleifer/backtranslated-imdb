Definitely not worth spending neither money nor time. It is the same trite plot of a boy and a girl who meet and fall in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably, whether it's representing a love story or giving it the Western touch. We never feel that the hero and the heroine are in love. There is no depth for any of his characters. Probably, with a better cast, justice could have been done to the characters. Finally, it is a film without fun, without acting, without theme, without argument, without comedy, without action, without emotion, without romance (I associate romance with something more passionate). Definitely not a movie that you would like to go with your family. In general, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I'll wait for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can wait to see and I can refer to my friends as a movie that "I must see".
