Honestly to God, the scheme almost says it all. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap strip club by L.A. There are no strippers, so the most recent male visitors leave to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> Men get confused with kings or get arrested for spying on women (although even though it is a women's planet, we only have two women who participate in any girl-girl sex scene) , and eventually, as always happens in sci-fi clich√© movies everywhere, women are convinced that men are good for something. Well, not the men who made this movie, anyway! <br /> <br /> But, boy, we can see a lot of that something, in prodigious amounts of soft sex and nudity. This one has less argument than usual for these movies, so change the channel if you do not like this kind of movie and clench your teeth if you like this kind of thing.
