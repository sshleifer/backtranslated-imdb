Despite the excellent cast and potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. He was convinced that the director was a beginner. The film is very badly edited, it shows many unimportant and annoying flashes, it has very visible errors and it does not have any atmosphere of suspense. The question that repeatedly came to mind while watching this was: "so what?" I could not care less about the protagonist and what happens to him. It is not that the story is not convincing, it is simply the way it is told. The movie tells the story. PERIOD. It's like an actor who mutters his lines, not knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events that happen, without a soul. And the director is the culprit. He does not know how to do something interesting or suspenseful or pleasant. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to watch die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 shit, on the contrary, I especially like slow-paced movies). So I was convinced that the director was a beginner. But to my surprise, this man has years of experience and has worked as a director of photography or camera assistant in many wonderful productions. I guess he had a bad year back then.
