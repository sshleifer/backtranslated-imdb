Eugene O'Neill is acclaimed by some as the leading playwright of the United States, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, The Journey from Long Day to Night, The Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was a piece of experimentation that he invented where the characters on stage, look aside at the audience and say what they are really thinking and then resume the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a break for dinner on Broadway, so you can assume that much has been sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> On the screen the voice over on the thoughts is used for all the characters. It is probably a more appropriate technique for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did very well in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill to his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. They are much more animated. Most of his films that are in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over a period of 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intention was assassinated in the First World War. She starts playing quite a lot, although that part is not shown in this version. She meets Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has as a perennial suitor, Ralph Morgan, a friend of Henry B. Walthall's father. <br /> <br /> He marries Kirkland, but then his mother, May Robson, warns him and shows that madness gallops in that family. To quote another literary work. As Kirkland wants children, Shearer and Robson believe that the Kirkland train will slide down the road if he does not get one, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Of course, you can see all the complications that this can cause and O'Neill explores them all. <br /> <br /> Gable is so terribly uncomfortable in an O'Neill production, but he was a promising player at MGM and they did what they told him. Shearer does what she can to raise a very sad story, but seems defeated at first. The best thing in the movie is possibly Robson, who puts a bit of bite into his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Strange Interlude ran for 426 Broadway appearances in 1928-1929 and was starring Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in the Gable and Shearer parts. Maybe nobody could have really saved the film because two years before, Groucho Marx made fun of her fillers in Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I do not think the movie that was made public would take him so seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, I could not either.
