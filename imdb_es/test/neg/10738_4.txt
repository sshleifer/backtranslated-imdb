Okay, present a lovely joke and you miss it (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old "horror" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough appear on the tombstones) the crushing of repu / con villains / morally bankrupt rightists are in the crosshairs: the foxes who preach morals, etc. But why are these soldiers anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why are not they going to kill the enemies that killed them or something? Why do ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made a movie? Questions never answered ...
