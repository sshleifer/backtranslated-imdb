If I had to throw this movie idea to some of Hollywood's big shots, I'm sure it would sound like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four guys at a private high school are good friends, and they're witches. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" That sounds like "The Craft". <br /> <br /> ME: "No, no, I said four kids, not four girls". <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "That still sounds like" The Craft ", only with children instead of girls". <br /> <br /> ME: "Okay, but there is a fifth unknown child that appears in the image and he he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" There's still not much difference, because one of the girls in "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> I: "OK, OK ... I will make these children part of the" crowd ", they will be rich, AND the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "Now that sounds original. That's nothing like "The Craft", here's a trillion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This movie was so clich√© and uninspiring, even the drama between Chase and the Ipswich brothers was very unpleasant. A handful of rich children, with their biggest color problem that Bentley wants for his 18th birthday (and car 18), do not interest me at all, even if they have powers.All the children in this movie seemed to have left of a magazine, and, of course, there had to be a free male nudity and 80% female nudity just to get carried away by the way you're out of shape, I wanted to change the name of this movie "The Witches of OC" Oooh, rich children and their problems ... Let me pretend that I care. <br /> <br /> This film was completely unimaginative and predictable The final fight was slow and prolonged and the ending was very anti-climatic This was a movie that was best left in the room and cutting.
