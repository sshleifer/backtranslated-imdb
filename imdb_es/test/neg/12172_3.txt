Terrible. I hope I can save two hours of your life by noticing this. I just finished watching the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good cross genre movies. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce or a religious action movie, I'll see them all. But you can not simply throw epigrammatic runs at a feast, a camp, a huge festival of horror and attract my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical films. This is not one of them. Anyone who is surprised by the depth of intellect that appears in this movie has not read a good book lately. Or never The "provocative" dialogue is, in the best of cases, trite. Maybe I lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laughter! I thought it would never start! Squirm? Only when I try to think in an educated way to express my opinion of the film to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is incongruously good on the stage of this movie, but even he can not resurrect her. I wish I had shot the director if the zombies. <br /> <br /> Out of shame, the earth that gave birth to Hell should also give rise to this. Dante would be turning in his grave.
