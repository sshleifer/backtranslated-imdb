Tom and Jerry are transporting goods by plane to Africa. But being white men, they worry that they are not safe, so they put on their black faces to adapt. Once they use it, they adopt the black dialect and completely inhabit their new characters. They hit the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before arriving on land, they suffer the advances of an octopus too affectionate and the most serious danger of sharks, swordfish and whale. Once on land, they are frightened by fantastic creatures and get into a cave. On the inside it is even worse when they encounter live skeletons on a black face. And when leaving the cave, things are even worse when they are discovered by the cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a specially neglected effort of Van Beuren Studios. An example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before them. But the animators must have forgotten, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending that is not an ending: it is just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon "originally intended to present the voices and cartoons of a popular 'Black' comedy team known as Miller and Lyles, but Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before that the recording session would be completed, and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'Tom & Jerry' story. "<br /> <br /> They should not have bothered. The raw animation and poorly executed gags make the film a loser from start to finish.
