Another horrible hollywood movie. This time a woman helps the revolution in a Central American country. Yes Yes Yes. Hey, let's make a movie without any sense of realism. I'm so sick of movies like this. The actors and actresses are terrible, the effects are corny and the dialogue is horrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet you're very proud of this. Well, I should not have expected much from this movie and I did not. And I'm glad because this sucks big. I wonder what kind of people like this movie. My guess is younger people 12-16 years old. And I guess some people like it because of Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in any of those groups and I hate it. Score: 2
