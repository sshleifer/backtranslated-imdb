I just saw this movie in Bravo! And it was absolutely horrible. It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without nudity. The premise was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in an isolated area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The characters were trivial, as were the observations on human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a movie called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with class differences, apart from the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. This movie could have been much better if there had been more motivated characters to get the ticket and it was a "Who did it?" <br /> <br /> The acting was not fantastic, but it's hard to look credible with such a terrible script Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I would like to see what I could do in a better production with a better script. It's probably the only reason I sat in the whole movie. <br /> <br />
