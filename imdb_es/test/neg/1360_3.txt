There really is not much happening in this movie. There are some key moments, and everything else is talking about a crucial moment that takes place before the movie starts. The main mechanism used in the story is the flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they are not here. There is a zero indication when flashing backwards or forwards, and there are only weeks to separate the events, so the context as the scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens. Maybe this was meant to add a sense of mystery in some places, but it was quite annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing a 100-minute discussion on the why of things and an insidious questioning of Good vs. Evil, enjoy. If you see the close-ups of a mostly empty look on Ryan Gosling's face during much of the movie that attracts you, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I can not find any reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another review indicated, Spacey really only has a cameo role here, and plays with a disinterested detachment that you've probably already seen. <br /> <br /> *** The rest contains spoilers although some important points are retained *** <br /> <br /> First, the murder of the so-called retarded child occurs before the movie starts, and we never learn what exactly happened. The implication is that they killed him to stop the deep sadness that was communicated through the child's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions, since the characters that are beyond the boy and the protagonist are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> As to what the main character has ... Another criticism suggests that he is crazy. I agree that it is not "right", but I do not know what I would call it crazy. It seems that the film tried to express that it was autistic or delayed in some way, because it seemed slow and unable to understand the obvious. Either that or they went for a careless young man with some detachment disorder and / or who was very medicated. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at conveying something to the audience, but it seems to be exactly what was deliberately left on the air in this case. This movie does not provide answers, just questions, but it was a bad enough movie to really not matter to me.
