Sometimes, Hallmark can do well, like The 10th Kingdom, but many of his fantasy movies are great, and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] Shown in the trailer and the advertising images did not appear), but anything that shortened the movie can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY HISTORY: <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film updates the story at the beginning of the 20th century (?), and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai, who is a fanatic Lexx, I kept waiting for him to say: "The dead do not solve riddles") of 18 years. It follows the basic story of Hans Christian Andersen: the boy takes a piece of ice in his eyes, gets bad, the Snow Queen takes it off to solve a puzzle in his palace and Gerda goes to look for it, and has several adventures on the way. <br /> <br /> As the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent gathering them and "falling in love". Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enamored enough to make sense of Gerda's search. By the time the main plot is started, the rhythm of the movie has been reduced to a crawl. Unfortunately, when Gerda begins her search for Kai, she only manages to accelerate the pace of a walk. <br /> <br /> There are some strange additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the beginning of the film, the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation is given for this. A polar bear that lives in the palace of the Queen of the Snows is more than meets the eye (although possibly this is because the producers realized that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be fine in a story of fairies, but not in a modern movie). Again, this is never explained. In addition, the indications that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are abandoned, but never fulfilled. The script is also full of anachronisms that really take you out of the mood of "fairy tales." <br /> <br /> The production looks good, although there is evidence of pickets: the palace of the Queen of the Snows is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with different degrees of success: Kai is as insipid as Gerda at the beginning, but once she starts to find Kai, you feel warm with her. Bridget Fonda looks very good like the Snow Queen, but she seems to be in a different movie from everyone else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is not satisfactory. It looks good, but it drags and it lacks magic.
