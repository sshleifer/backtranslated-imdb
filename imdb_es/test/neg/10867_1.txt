The worst movie I've seen. Like the other honest reviewers, it's just an excuse to get the naked birds out without their juggs. Make no mistake, naked women are not a bad thing, but there is another genre of films for that. <br /> <br /> Beware of the couple. I sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang festival (due to the reviews) so she would greet me with any other scene full of naked women turning around. Give me a slap on the chops. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh most is that all the dogey bike dives that were attended in the film were full of models with the aesthetic style. What motorcyclist's bars have these? In general, they are a bit haggard with tattoos and much cleverer juggs. Completely unreal The acting is terrible, a lot of useless insults and a complete waste of time in the story. <br /> <br /> Did someone prove Vinnie Jones' attempt by American accent? It's as shameful as his soccer skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. The only reason you would see this movie is if you are a young guy who can not access p @ rn and has stolen it from his parents' movie collection for a few kicks.
