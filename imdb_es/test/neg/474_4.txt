I like B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very visible actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2 and' Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked 'Running Time'. However, I do not know if I'll ever see this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, after saying that, I bet the comment tracks and special features will be worth seeing! This movie has too many holes for you to enjoy, even as a cheap movie. First, Ted Raimi was annoying, just annoying. There was nothing in his misplayed / written character that has not been done better a thousand times before. Unfortunately, the direction was bad and the choice of some shots ... ay. I do not expect Woody Allen or James Cameron to be here, but Campbell did not give birth. <br /> <br /> I did not buy this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall', but still 'I'm disappointed. I would have liked 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I have much less At the end of the film there were no scenes that occurred to me, no dialogue that resonated within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for the love of petes! I do not recommend this movie.
