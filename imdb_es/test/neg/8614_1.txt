The plot is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the "all-powerful" Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the great vampire chief. This is fine so far. The girl's partner stays to look for her. And now the horror begins. He meets a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires are in conflict with the evil for about ... 800 years. However, with the help of the 'good vampires', the boy starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the fight scenes begin, what is a karate movie without a fight? Another thing I have noticed is that vampires are very ugly guys. I mean ... a vampire is an old guy (he's been alive since ... forever), he's got style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie, vampires are ... strange. Like, come on, ride a bicycle, everyone is dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their own way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie is low budget. . The script is boring and the actors do not have much talent. The music is pretty good, but the effects are not so good. <br /> <br /> To summarize the film is not so good, but if you have a free afternoon, look at it and tell me if I am True or not.
