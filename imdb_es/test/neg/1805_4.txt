In a sense, this movie does not even compare to the novel. However, it was good to have a vision of how the Congo looked and also of the natives if you are not good at visualizing while reading. I would never recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book. I almost do not suggest watching this movie, much less any other film based on this literary work. This movie; And many others, did not comply with this book. An important part that is missing in the film is MArlow's sense of how the government of the lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the movie, MArlow and his companions did not stop and took the note and the wood. Similarly, Kurtz's African mistress hits Marlow towards the end of the story, which has a great influence on the story but not on the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, however he died in his hut in the movie. The boyfriend's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
