Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have contributed any redeeming quality to a demonstration of this "gem". <br /> <br /> This is like a cheesy pirate copy of the 80's pornography that you could have bought on VHS from a commercial gallery on 42nd Street. Before Disney bought all the crush and closed them all. <br /> <br /> But, wait, all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse movie. This film could replace the aquatic approach as a human method of interrogation. <br /> <br /> No, I withdraw it, I would prefer the water boarding. <br /> <br /> The only credit that this film could win, apart from being the worst movie ever made, would be to threaten the Middle East to solve its problems, under the pain of having to watch this movie.
