The fact that this movie has a bargain quality is a real shame, but in the 1940s it was the only type of film made for theaters that serves black audiences due to segregation. So, while MGM, Warner and all the other great studios were making extremely polished films, small studios with limited budgets were left messing with what they had. And seeing this movie, it is obvious that a lot of energy was devoted to making the film, even if it is a very aesthetic film. Some of the actors were not particularly good (especially French), the scenarios were minimal and the plot was totally silly, BUT the film also had good music, of different styles, from classical to jazz, rhythm and blues. This is thanks to many talented but practically unrecognized black artists. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, it was totally stupid and stupid, but you can still see it in a kitsch way. I loved seeing Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the TV show AMOS 'N ANDY) on the street, as he made the ugliest woman in film history (this includes the Bride of Frankenstein and many others). This is probably due to the fact that when he was NOT in the drag, he was a pretty ugly but fun guy. If the man who pretended to be a woman really looked remotely like a woman, I doubt that this movie would have worked. Seeing this man ugly and with the rubber face with a corny wig STILL being very wanted by three suitors was very fun. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie but from a historical point of view, it is fascinating and excellent observation for young adults to know what America was like for blacks in this era. A very interesting and fun time capsule.
