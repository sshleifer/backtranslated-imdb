This has to be one of those times when you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet full moon, crows, a scarecrow with a scythe. Well, my impression (I had seen the scarecrow on TV a few weeks ago) perfect, a good movie to start the evening. ............ bad, absolutely wrong, I think 5 minutes I was going to get it out, but I thought I lost $ 3 in this, so I'll finish it when the scarecrow is. Well, I guess it's the legs of fisher man wearing sturdy rain boots. You see that from time to time I was seeing this thinking ... OK, when those brats are going to meet this guy, at one moment I thought they were dead. But no ... I mean the fridge, they're still alive. I only chuckled in some parts because of how bad they were on the scene. One was the zoom in part at the beginning. the director / actor / writer says: "Remember that I had that feeling, well, I have it again" and it was an approach or a distancing, the hell I'm checking. but I guess the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean, what is more shocking is that his wife had the same surprised look ... OK ... did she believe him? I'm sorry, but YES ... I did not know he was a psychic until I read the box of the movie to make some sense of what I witnessed. Not only that, they used images to make you think that this movie is, at least, clear. <br /> <br /> The other thing that made me laugh a little was the scream in the camera, to make me scared ....... OK .............. ... filming a girl up close screaming at the camera for 5 minutes .......... I laughed at how pathetic it was that these children can not act like the rest of the people in the movie. <Br /> <br /> To top things off the scythe must have been lost or something ... because it seems that the bad guy only had a stick. not even an ax, someone should remove the production film from the dam <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the image, this movie is a piece of shit. I saw the trailer and I guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS WHERE YOU ARE TALKING TO ME AND MAIZE
