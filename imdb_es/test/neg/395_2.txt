This is one of those movies that I saw and I asked myself, why did I see it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I did not find it very realistic. No, I have never used a 'lizard of lots', nor have I seen, nor have I heard of anyone who travels all over the country in a new RV of seventy thousand dollars, either. <br /> <br /> The same about a pimp who has never tried the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, she still did not ...), and only received $ 50 'in rebate ', when the prostitute receives $ 200.00 (well, $ 150.00 after her cut, yes ...). <br /> <br /> I still laugh at Ivey's lizard comment (they are Lot's lizards, they screw anything with 20 dollars, and some are men dressed as women ... or something as weird ), that is, we are better than them, since we can still be prostitutes, but they pay us BETTER. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, it's just the story of a young woman who liked something more of life than a dead-end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and her Mother embarrassed her by doing the same (work without exit). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. He fulfilled FIVE tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 she made was worth it. I suppose not.
