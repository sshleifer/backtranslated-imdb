Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely by its own merits, the assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in Detroit (If Detroit's location is giving Robocop heat and the lint stops right now.) He could have said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have happened. In fact, the last bit in the forest would have made more sense.) Around them are our bad guys; Corrupt police. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you think. Corrupt police? Were the Nazis and the drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course, these are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of Tom Clancy's last videogame. Yes we have body armor; helicopters laser sights; Night vision glasses of the works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. Members / Special forces armed to the teeth verses 4 policemen (drunk that is the eve of the new year), 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> So, how do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is that they can not. Everyone should be dead within the maximum ten minutes. (Not to mention that the characters inside have the annoying habit of walking through the windows). Now, an illogical scenario is not a reason to film a film completely. A B-style action movie However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be a comedic relief. (At least I hope they are) <br /> <br /> While the characters of Ja-Rules and Leguizamo are bad enough. It is the minstrel show of Aisha Hind that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotyped African-American character appeared on the modern screen. His performance resembles a frat boy in the ghetto and the acting ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original Assault, a gang member takes control of an ice cream truck and drives through the neighborhood shooting the girls in the head. Since then I have had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this Assault I have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.
