I think the best way to review this title is to divide it into its pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: ~ become wolves instead of plastic / cartoon monsters. ~ the pursuit of the wolves through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" of Hard-Fi that is being played <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ some parts of the script make you tremble (for example, the terrible part where the woman escapes from the "lucky games" of the boys "Lucky Five", and there is approximately half an hour of "Dear cousin" and a rotating shift of "Yes, look, we know Gabriel's law") ~ the transformation of diving is ridiculous ~ the obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden was told thousands of times to leave, and then says: "if you worried about me, you would have left me" ~ the obvious characters ~ the unnecessary stimulus ~ the totally unnecessary cutting of the arm by of Aiden ~ Gabriel's speeches <br /> <br /> You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love the werewolf movies, and I tried to see this several times to see if I would like more, but it only made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I'm getting along. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this unless you have a brother or sister of 12 years in creepy things. Any person over that age can suffer and want their hour and a half back.
