Some folkie friends recommended this, but as a film it really lacks originality. I found that the characters are unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the start. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, you will keep your interest long enough to listen to the next one. I have also read that the soundtrack does not look anything like the music of the film, with professional musicians who are content with the actors.
