I completely forgot that I had seen this in a couple of days, which is quite revealing in itself. The number one version of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera', the mystery of the closed country house of Leroux de Leroux, had heard that it was an attractive and ingenious update. So it came from the nice sequence of titles and some neat touches in the opening scene, but the film quickly stopped and became vaguely tedious and totally unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> As a mystery, the biggest problem is that it is fundamentally impossible to solve by the public: like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a lot of background information from which we have not had knowledge. As a film, whether comedy or thriller, the crucial problem is that the characterization is almost nonexistent. With the exception of the murderer, they are all a nominal version of the typical suspects in the typical murder story in a country house: reporter, heiress in danger of extinction, promised suspect, clueless scientific father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale) , etc. The depth and the little interest, and the performances often too mature or poorly evaluated do not help. Frankly, you do not care about anyone, so there is no danger or suspense. Only Claude Rich and, in the last roll, Pierre Arditi have something to work with, and only in the last roll does the film come close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest, we have an endless exposure and a couple of possible ineffective comic pieces (a promising one with a photographer stuck inside a grandfather clock is too poor to pay), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving. Explainer of the last third of the image. I do not like cottage movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits, so those who are may lose a lot more attention, but I thought it was a bad show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, "it's more of a disappointment."
