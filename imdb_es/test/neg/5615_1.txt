Despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the always incredible Rappaport and Woods, this is another of those quirky comedies where New York launches the hero in an effort of the writer and / or director to show how crazy this place is. Yes, there are other things in the movie that stinks too, but that's the important thing. The trend for independent filmmakers in New York seems to be "I do not need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Well, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback of why the only guy named Wacky Jack was quite funny. The script is not a story or a plot, it is a set of not good scenes linked together with the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no reason behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam has the child delivering the drugs, why? If it's that important, why did not Sam do it himself? Then, the main character is in his rear scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain by lying. The boy falls in love with a stewardess and none of them has any reason to fall in love. The characters are a lot of pawns for the writer to move to see if he can make something crazy happen. <br /> <br /> If you have easy fun or you like to watch bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad conventional films, look at this. If you want to see what a GOOD light heart crime movie looks like, look at Takeshi Kitano's "Brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate indie movies out of the ordinary: MANY OF THEM SUCK. And a note for the director: Do not be afraid to excite, entertain, enlighten or entertain the audience from time to time. Being boring does not make you a better filmmaker than those who may interest me.
