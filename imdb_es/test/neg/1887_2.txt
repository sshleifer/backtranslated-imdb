I saw this movie when I was a child, and then I thought it was terrible. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have done better than this. They simply decided to win as much money as possible by using all their monsters at once. For me, that was a cheap shot. These characters were able to defend themselves in their own films, and the choice of actors was deplorable. Dracula needed to be Bela Lugosi, the monster of Frankenstein, to be Karloff. <br /> <br /> In my mind, it was the sequence of the squalid Disney sequence made decades ago, and it was not appreciated. Umiversal started with something great and original, and then thought that they could please the masses with the stupid one that is extremely evident in this movie.
