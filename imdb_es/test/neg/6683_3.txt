I missed it at the movies, but it was always a bit forced. I found it in the dumpster in my local video store for two measly dollars! Will I give it to anyone who wants it now? Probably! No intentional plot, one-dimensional characters, plastic world ripped from many much better films, or decent dialogues to talk about. Do you know that empty feeling when you descend from ecstasy? It's that feeling right here. The sad thing is that the Australia I know is heading in this direction, minus the melodrama and the simple answers. Interesting only to see the older Australian actors (who had to ACT in their day to survive) against the newer Australian actors (who have to LOOK GOOD to survive). As a horribly shrill narrative introduction to a movie clip that never begins ... Poor Kylie, began her acting career as well ...
