"Tank Girl" was, I suppose, destined to be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was marketed as such. The comparison is certainly appropriate; both movies have so many things happening in any given frame of the movie that, no matter how impossible the story is, it's certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a pretty fun trip if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise, you will end up with a headache like you.
