The movie is not so bad, until ... <br /> <br /> The main problem is the end, so it's a big spoiler ... <br /> <br /> At the moment it was made It's a beautiful movie, and it does a lot of good. <br /> <br /> However ... <br /> <br /> In the book, Sam succeeds and lives his dream, while in The Movie, he gives up and returns to the city, destroying completely the subject "you can do what you propose" of the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is a desecration and, instead of remaking Classics that do not need to be redone, Hollywood types who do not have better ideas should do this, this time.
