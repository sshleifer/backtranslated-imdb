A friend warned me that this was the worst movie I had ever seen. I was curious, because I had developed a bit of a cult status. I like many strange indie cult movies, so I tried. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of manure. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better things if you want to watch a twisted indie film. Test Dead Alive by Peter Jackson (also known as Braindead), Cemetery Man (also known as Dellamorte Dellamore), or modern vampires.
