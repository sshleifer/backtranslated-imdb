My expectations were high after watching the trailer. They were even louder when I saw that the film had the same director as Independence Day and Godzilla. The special effects on independence day were much better than in this movie. The whole movie was waiting for the spiders to appear. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders arrived, they looked very amateurish, as if the special effects were from a movie made in the 60s. I did not see the whole movie. When it was played for about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night, and I've never left a movie, even if it was so boring. The only good thing in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So do not go see this, you should go out and rent Starship Troopers, it's just like 10,000 times better.
