... Brian? What the hell were you * when * you signed to do this? <br /> <br /> I saw him recently at a festival, and he was greeted by a laugh. When the credits ended, tears ran down the faces of many of the attendees. <br /> <br /> The plot is a clumsy mix of 'E.R.' and 'The X-Files'; so cynically aimed at the television audience as it is possible to obtain without being sued. The sequences involving the abductions are hilarious: both Yuzna's staging of the 'floating on the bed' and that of the pathetic pathetic aliens of 'Screaming Mad George' attracted an incredulous and mocking laugh. <br /> <br /> Clean, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it was an aberration. As horrible as the 'Return of the living dead 3' was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
