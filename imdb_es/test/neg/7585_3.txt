I chose this DVD from the cheepo store at Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew during Vietnam (C-123k). I did not fly for Air America, but I knew that as a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot who did it, including those who flew in my Reserve Unit in my country. I'm not a film critic, but I wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make films like this. The best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. The flying shots and the acrobatics (although they are totally cartoon) are excellent. The movie starts with the favorite Hollywood guy in 1969. But the fact is that Nixon did not start Air America, he did not start the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war and Air America. It is neither fair nor accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody smart enough to fly a C-123 was foolish enough not to know what they were joining. That makes Downey's character incredible. A C-123 was a robust aircraft. I could easily fly in an engine, or in the two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges that shoot a duck with a shot are more likely. The pilots who flew with Air America were civil employees of the CIA, they were not soldiers of imprudent fortune. They had a good reason to behave and believe in the future, if they survived their extremely dangerous work. They were given double time for a retirement pension. They were not required to sell drugs or weapons to obtain a good pension. The drug was legal and a way of life in the EAE, as it is today in Afghanistan. If the individual pilots were trying to win money, it was not the CIA's policy. The CIA was waging a war against communism, not against drugs. The writer based his story on "war stories". Pilots love to fire anyone who buys them a beer and listens. The writer and director who had an ax to grind to Viet-Nam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it begins: blame Nixon for what existed for years. Remember, he did not become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the landing of the hill in the jungle. The pilots of Air America placed planes in places that aircraft designers never thought possible. There were many funny stories that could have been shown. Instead, the Director opted to use the large rubber scene to show how silly the CIA was. This scene shows that the Director and the writer fell in love with a pilot bar talk and the joke is on them. <br /> <br /> MDS Fort Valley Virginia.
