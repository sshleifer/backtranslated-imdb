This movie is ridiculous. It tries to be a comedy but the script is horrible. The whole movie is made in low light and you can not understand the fact that it is a comedy. It is truly bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and see it to realize that there are some jokes here and there, but anyway, they are all internal jokes with each other. This is more like an aspiring drama movie that went wrong. It really is a very useless movie. Their expressions reveal nothing but consternation and disaster, which is the case anyway. Unless you want to get bored with your ass, I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.
