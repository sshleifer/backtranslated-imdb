Where do I begin? It's one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense, but it turns out to be really stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited in bed? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black-and-white flashback of a strange-looking fat guy who goes dominatrix in a Fabienne of Pulp Fiction, winner of the lookalike contest and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to establish how the bed factors in the story. However, if you want an opportunity to keep people interested or to send them away sooner, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Advancing to this day, a couple moves into an apartment with a friendly owner and begins to unpack their things, so far everything is normal. Then, one night, while doing the hippity on a single mattress, they realize that they need a bed frame. This is where things get ugly, why did not they bring or buy a damn rack before getting there? We learned that the door that leads to the attic where the first 2 minutes were held does not open, but once the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic, they discover the old frame of the bed and they decide to lower it and their days of love are saved ... or so they thought. The rest of the film centers around the two being chased by the bed frame. The woman is an artist, so she begins to draw the macabre images with which she dreams and the man is a photographer, so she begins to make her models act as if they were tortured or tied (one of which has gray hair and appears above). 50 years old, disgusting) The female becomes more and more afraid and discovers that the house in which she lives was once a refuge for serial murders and murders that caused the end of the film. They find the friendly owner murdered (which does not make sense since the ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get out of the trap. While packing, the husband climbs moronically to the attic where he is possessed by a fat maniac and the female hits his skull before the police introduce themselves and take her to a mental ward where she kills a guy who tries to hit her. . <br /> <br /> Well, if you've read this far, you have to be thinking about one thing ... WHY HELL HAVE NOT ARRIVED IN THE NAME OF THE ROOM TO THE WINDOW? Seriously, they never said anything about the house itself, about the bed ... so, why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it's actually a good argument and the actors follow suit, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone in a toll booth. The couple tried to leave the city as has been proposed to all other films that have the old scheme of "Oh, let's give this place a chance, honey," so point to that. Even so, me and my friend who watched the movie repeated every 5 minutes ... why did not they throw the bed? Especially once they found out I was thrilled, it would have been a good time to set it on fire or something. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an almost visible movie with many porn scenes like a bed and a credible plot (to some extent), but the solution is so simple that at the end of the film it He is scratching his head and wondering how stupid the married couple can be. The highlight of the film is when the husband tells the 50-year-old model to extend his legs and his assistant tells him that he can not shoot him that way. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 (low budget) porn The man show would love)
