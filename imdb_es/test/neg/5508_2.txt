I am a fan of the strange style of Jess Franco, and a lover even of his dumbest movies, and my personal opinion is that, in addition to several very entertaining films, he has also created some masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" aka "Venus" In skins "of 1969, for example. However, it is an undeniable fact that the more than 180 films that this prolific filmmaker has directed in his career, also include a lot of big stinkers. "Sadomania" of 1981 is certainly one of these smelly things, just an absolutely bad movie and less plot with the ability to bore you despite the constant sleaze and nudity. <br /> <br /> Of course, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but since it continues like this, it is very likely that you will get bored after a short time. The only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze that, generously spoken, is slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> After a couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert of some island, they are stopped by a group of topless women carrying guns, guards of a local prison camp. While the husband is expelled from the island, the wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymph magda and an extremely perverted governor. The prisoners are, of course, totally hot chicks, most of them blond, the guards are totally topless women with rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, is extremely stupid, of course, but who will see this for a good plot anyway. The (only) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a film of 'Women in Prison'. There are probably two short scenes in the movie in which we see a woman wearing a T-shirt, the sordidness contains all kinds of sexual perversions, from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that a movie with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so boring. The sordidness will keep you looking at the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes it really cost me a lot not to fall asleep. It also makes me wonder why, of all porn stars, Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson, who, according to most sources, was a transsexual who was born a man (well, maybe for that reason). If you really want to see this, make sure you have enough beer at home to be able to sit through it and observe it only for sleaze and exploitation (and perhaps for the slight factor of involuntary fun). However, do not expect that you entertain much, it is almost incredible that a movie with such a high level of disappointment can be so boring. I'm a fan of Jess Franco and I always will be, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
