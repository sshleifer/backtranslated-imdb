I rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my bedroom. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they are well known bad movies that I've never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it coincided with the guide "How to find a bad movie" on badmovies.org, There is no real description, there are no pictures of the movie in the back, and I had never heard of that, it had to be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so horrible that it does not matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie TRUE, Lep 4 and Jack Frost is stupid on purpose, this is stupid despite the best efforts of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> This "movie" begins as Evil Dead, even The actors look similar and have the same style of dressing. Unlike Evil Dead, it never gains any speed. For a movie "slasher" it is quite insipid, in 80 minutes they kill 6 people, but until now they become boring. <br /> <br /> The director threw many boring shots at the animals The hunt, obviously goes along with the whole "Prey" theme, but they do nothing to advance the story and they are quite boring. The blood is horrible. All these extra shots were to compensate for the lack of a script and a story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the film are recorded mainly in slow motion, another way to add more duration. The "climax" is a total joke, it's hard to laugh because it's so bad. The back of the box says "The end will surprise you and chase you". Yes, it will, you will be surprised that someone can put a "plot twist" so bad in the movie and "harass" you because you do not think you paid to see this shit. <br /> <br /> Also the slogan is "It's not human, and it has an ax!" A person dies with an ax in the whole movie and is off the screen. <br /> <br /> A true 1 out of 10. I LOVE to laugh at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it even lacks enthusiasm. qualities No bad movie night is competing without a real character building movie: P
