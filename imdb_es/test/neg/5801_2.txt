Okay, how can anyone really think that this movie is amazing, it surpasses me ... I can not understand how anyone can find this remotely funny movie, the only character that has its favor, is the evil designer of super nerd games, and that gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, the punch lines are not funny, they're forced, it looks better acting in the red light district, and the story sucks, it's so predictable that you know EXACTLY what's going to happen. Even the characters do not react as they should, try to go with the sexy girl who is your boss at work and tell him that you are hitting 2 crazy girls with whom you live at the same time, his answer would not be (smiles). ) "Ok let's go back to work". I did not laugh once during this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent $ 3 to rent it because it's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this film, I have lost all respect for him. All of his films are the same, his comedy style has grown old since The Waterboy came out, if he knew that Adam Sandler had produced this before I rented it ... there's no way I've wasted my time on that. This movie is as bad as you can get from all aspects ... ace ventura was not a smart comedy movie, it did not have a murderous plot ... but it was original and very funny. I'm not playing the movie because it has "low level" humor, I'm hitting it because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood junk. If this film were presented to a production company and did not have "ADAM SANDLER" behind, it would be thrown away faster than a used condom. If you want a good movie about pot culture, look at Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you'll get is a generic comedy that targets young people from 14 to 17 years old, with strong rock music in every possible cut, a performance that will make your eyes narrow and your stomach turn into a Comedy equivalent to watching your Stoned friend eating McDonalds for an hour and a half. Do not do it ... for the love of God ... this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look beyond all the glory of Hollywood behind it ... Hercules in New York used to be the worst movie ever seen, but in reality it's so bad that it's good. This, on the other hand, was a very expensive movie that stunk so much, if not more.
