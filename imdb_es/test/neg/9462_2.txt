** Spoiler * Give the final very irrelevant ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, there was a brief introduction to the world of gore by the gore movie teacher, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then he found it years after the director's death. He also talked about how Gore's films were measured by the amount of blood in stage used in them. The blood party was a gallon of 2, 10,000 maniacs was a gallon of 5. But then it goes away and claims that Dr. Gore was a gallon of 15. I want to know where the half of the 15 gallons were. Watching the movie, I saw very little near 15 gallons. Granted, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but there were not nearly 15 gallons. Some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely quite bloody and realistic, ropes of meat and all, but I would not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "FINAL !!! Â¡ENNNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!! Does it sound familiar to you?" That's what you should have been saying about the last half of this movie. Igor was thrown into the acid bath, the film was reduced to a painful drag, there was no coherent ending, since it did not fit in anything in the previous 90. She left in a van with a total unknown, GREAT OFFER That is what happens when a person is kept (I will not say a person, because he does not qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around him. The doctor teaches the girl that a man should be loved, so that every man she meets, she loves. <br /> <br /> Even though HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that we might not like the performance, the direction, or even the gore ... I'll go with options A and B. BOTH WERE TERRIBLE !! It was enough to give me bad dreams of editing cuts and people with eyes disguised while talking to a person. But, I did it through the movie, and it came out stronger. Too bad I could not say the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> This was a BAD movie. Usually, I can take my doses of vinegar calmly, but once in a while, you get a movie that bites you. I think this movie took off an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *) Admitted, I enjoyed the fixed scenes, where the good doctor looked at his future victims and opened his eyes REALLY and opened his eyes. He was VERY similar to Fuad Ramseys in the Feast of the Blood when he looked at that lady in his catering store, and after that he did not use his power. I guess this movie takes Fuad's powers back. <br /> <br /> * Final sentence * The movie should have been lost. Good day <br /> <br /> -Scott-
