The Bone Collector is located in New York City and begins as one of the leading criminologists and crime experts in the world, Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him in a quadriplegia bedridden. Advance four years and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, shortly after the New York police, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), is called to the scene of the crime and finds the body buried and mutilated Alan. Amelia notices some unusual evidence of the crime scene and takes note of it, which impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case, she quickly realizes that the evidence is, in fact, cryptic clues to Lindsay's whereabouts . After deciphering the clues, the cops came too late to save her, but this is only the beginning, as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill and leave forensic clues for Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br / > Directed by Phillip Noyce I saw The Bone Collector last night and I have to say it's one of the worst big budget posts, The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995), the serial killer thrillers I've seen, done on Friday the 13th (1980) Look sophisticated and realistic! Jeremy Iacone's script was based on Jeffery Deaver's book and is so poor on so many levels that I almost do not know where to start. To begin with, he takes himself seriously and that makes all other failures seem twice as bad. The characters are really horrible and I did not think any of them was a true human being. First we have Lincoln Rhyme, who is paralyzed by the neck and there is not much that the script can do with him, in fact, literally, he can not do anything but lie in bed throughout the film. Apparently he is impressed with Amelia because he stopped a train and thought that a new footprint near a murdered person could be relevant, I am not being funny here, but no policeman would realize that a fingerprint near a murder victim could have some relevance ? Why are you so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who is not only unpleasant and screams at everyone for no apparent reason, but is so incompetent that he could not connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh and skin removed surgically from their bodies . How exactly did this guy become a police captain? Then there is the killer whose motives are less plausible, are you trying to tell me that they devised a complex plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in prison for something they really did? If they wanted to take revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything? Maybe he could just buy someone who wanted revenge against the guy who kept them, but not kill other people who have no connection to themselves. , the desired objective rhymes anything else. In addition, after devising an intricate plan to kill these people and get away with it, they suddenly become the stupidest person in history, since despite holding a large knife and being able to walk and use their arms, in they are actually defeated and almost killed by a quadriplegic. Who has no movement in his body under his neck! How did that happen? I must also mention Amelia, who is a terrible character, who actually buys her own camera to take pictures of the crime scene and shoots the rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Besides some of the worst written characters in the story and the plot is not much better. We never discovered why the killer is using The Bone Collector's book as inspiration. We never found out why the killer was taking meat strips from his victims. It is never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter the crime scene even before the appropriate forensic teams. There is no reason to explain why the killer chooses his victims. Also the murderers' clues are a bit dark, right? I mean an animal bone with blood and shaved rat hair? Logically, how does someone pass from a hair of bones and rats to the exact location of the next victim and has the entire state of New York to choose from? There is some nonsense about a bird that sits on the edge of the Rhymes window, which is totally random and in almost two hours the bone collector is very slow. The bone collector has many errors and everything is reduced to one of the worst scripts in history, it is atrocious on all levels and has no credibility. Apparently, Angelina Jolie has stated that she filmed nude scenes for this film, but that they were cut because it was considered too distracting. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 48,000,000 The bone collector is well made and has a good production values ​​and Hollywood brightness about it. I should also add now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I've seen, I think it's absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington simply lies there, Queen Latifah is horrible and even Michael Rooker can not do much, as he is stuck with a cliché and one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The bone collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a long time, I saw them for free on TV last night and I still feel cheated and cheated. There are so many things to make holes, is it ridiculous, shamefully horrible or should it be terribly embarrassing? It works in any way to be honest ...
