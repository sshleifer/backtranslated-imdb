I met ÆON in the early 90s through television and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about that? The drawing style in a bad mood? The impeccable artistic action involved? The absurd and inexpressive communication between the characters? All the distribution of the surrounding future world? It does not matter what you loved ... <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux movie of the end of 2005 does not have any of that. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly overloaded with the transportation of the original content to a new movie. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is inscrutable and the vague characters do not develop during the movie. <br /> <br /> Kusama's The attempt to improve the story by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not just an unconvincing attempt to cover up their flaws as a narrator, it's simply unworthy of the original concept of ÆON. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron might be an attractive woman, but she can not pass herself off as the ÆON character. Although she was tied to ropes doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply ruins the action sequences in the film. The result is a tremendous amount of image clippings to cover the pure lameness of his physique. <br /> <br /> Forget about everything else, it's not worth talking about ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point to Mrs. Theron showing her tits and 1 point for good architectural photography of the movie. That's.
