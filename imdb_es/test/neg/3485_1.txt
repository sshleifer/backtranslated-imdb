I had the luck of growing up surfing in San Diego (not in the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood, I assure you) and I have seen MANY surf movies in my life. After seeing NORTH SHORE for the first time at this moment, all I can say is THANKS TO GOD I never saw this as a child. If I had seen this and mistakenly thought that it was a realistic representation of the surfing scene, I would sell my board and I would totally get into it, I do not know, accounting or anything like that. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie has as much in common with the real surf as the TOP GUN that had the real military life. The acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is doubtful at best and oh my God, what was Laird Hanilton thinking? WOW!!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! What sucks! If you want a REAL surf movie, see RIDE GIANTS. Hell, look SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Chupa Sucks badly. Sucks really bad. Brah;) <br /> <br /> PS: I had to change my summary of "WTF?!" to wtf because, apparently, we're supposed to whisper on this site. THERE ARE NO SHOWS !!! (shhhhhh!); D
