This looks like one of these Australian films made by "talented" and government-funded students. It is full of intelligent photos of colors and shapes and verbal excursions to Freudian psychology so that both art students and teachers appreciate it, but in general you can perceive a stupid mockery of good cinema, good narration and good taste in general. . I guess this is what happens when art students become so obsessively indulgent. "Pink Flamingos" is miles ahead of one of the same subjects. Some porn movies from the 70s are much more visible and inspiring. Book of Revelation is not completely without merit, but as a general experience it is well below grade B average.
