First: a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on DVD in the Universal series 'Hitchcock Collection'. The original impression seems to be in perfect condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting that it could be a second generation copy directly from the video. The framing is too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the film is clipped. According to other IMDb reviews, there is a much better version available. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just a footnote in Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut In the sixties, Hitchcock offered an overview of all his work, but all he could say about this photo is that he did it as a favor for Carole Lombard and He did not understand the characters, so he just photographed the Norman Krasna script. . <br /> <br /> In truth, there is not much more to say. <br /> <br /> It's a mindless comedy, from the same mold that Happened One Night, Your Girl Friday and the history of Philapdelphia. Carole Lombard is a typical fighter who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, fights with her husband for the weakest of pretexts and passes that most of the image is "adorably" unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery well enough like the husband, but it's hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the film, the audience says: "Leave the silly cow, it's not worth it". <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend he is committed to. He is supposed to be a Southern courtier and "old family", although this is not obvious from his accent and only becomes evident in the drunken scene (which otherwise plays very well). He is an honorable, generous and teetotal gentleman, so, of course, he is harassed and condescending by Robert Montgomery and he made the butt of many of the jokes, although he is not as badly treated as the similar character of Ralph Bellamy on His Girl Friday. br /> <br /> This movie feels as if it had been made by people who only knew meaningless comedies, but had not actually seen any. For example, a good comedy about the inflation balls has a strong central idea with a number of ongoing comic threads that interlace and overlap continuously. Here, all the elements of the comedy are strung together, like beads on a necklace. This is a comedy of shooting by numbers. <br /> <br /> It's the same with the address. Usually, these comedies run at an increasing rate that rises to near hysteria at the end. Hitchcock does not understand this. Its direction is somewhat lethargic and the image becomes a majestic succession of scenes that seem all overgraded (but undernourished) and too long. He was never a particularly good actor director, so he just let the cast do it. They do it right. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he used frequently in his thrillers, but he did not feel comedy as a genre. His last problem with Harry was also a misfire, for reasons similar to this movie, but at least he was involved in that image. Here he is just repeating the movements. <br /> <br /> All the people related to this movie were good solid professionals, so it's not especially bad. It just feels a bit derivative, too familiar, too long and, ultimately, quite flat. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are only for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock completistas.
