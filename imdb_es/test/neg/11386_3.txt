Somehow, this documentary about Miles manages to include very little music and not complete melodies. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other people, not Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood prodigy, his addiction to drugs) are skipped or overlooked, and he will learn little about what he did to man and his contribution to music so innovative. Skip it.
