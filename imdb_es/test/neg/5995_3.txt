This should have oscillated. VH1 moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that made the 2003 show so old. Unfortunately, the movement failed. The show did not have MC keeping the show together. Queen Latifah made a fantastic show at the 2003 Divas. The show began with a horrible interpretation of Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay, in the studio, with some control, everyone can sound good. <br /> <br /> However, when they compete with each other (why?) it just sounds like a torturer! Jessica Simpson has the strangest facial expressions when she sings that I have witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. That was not so bad, but it was not that impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle came together to make Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic and did not fit with the rest of the show. Still, it could have been fine if they had not both insisted on screaming like mamma animals. It was horrible. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always great. She has her own style and although she may not be able to compete vocally with many of the divas, she certainly can sing very well. Debbie came out and performed the # 1 hit of Blondie 'Rapture'. With some lovely voices. She really hit the notes perfectly. She looked awesome. The rapper Eve provided a new rap, but sadly inferior. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a team with newcomer Joss Stone. They made the Blondie success 'One Way or Another'. I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted for Debbie. A bit sad was when Debbie tried and could not match her screaming style that ruined her a bit. I should have let Joss continue his totally inappropriate warballing. The whole of Blondie made this track. The last song that Debbie made was the massive success of Blondie "Call Me". It was quite poor. It's not Debbie's fault because you just could not hear her. The sound was atrocious throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also performed some songs on his own. They were pretty well made. Ashanti also showed up to make two versions of inexplicable covers. First she made Diana Ross' 'I'm Coming Out', and then Chaka Khan 'Is not Nobody'. She is not a diva! She can sing to a certain point, but she has no presence. Why not just include the real singers? Chaka was even interviewed on the show ... <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight appeared and made a mix. It was very good She was probably the best part of the show. I do not know much about her, other than that she is an experienced artist in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone. Patti Labelle fit in another presentation this time, her 80s 'New Attitude' success. It was the end and it was fine, but it was too late. This was a great failure. Better luck the next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a well-edited 55 minute version that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If these were the best bits .....
