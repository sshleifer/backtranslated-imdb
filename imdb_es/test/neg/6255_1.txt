This movie was just bad. I can forgive the low budget movies for being low budget, but it was not funny, it was not smart, I did not have any redemption unless you really like to look at fake tits. I do not know what this genre is classified, possibly as erotic horror, but if so, well, it is neither sexy nor scary. Tying him in the Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I had never seen the previous films, and except for a scene that tried to unite them, I had no way of knowing who was the psycho killer escaped in "Cheerleader" or why they bothered to include it, especially because (and I do not think it is revealing anything here) it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this movie was not him. As for the real murderer? All I can say is, I take it. I'm really lame. When you find out why the killer is moving away from the squad of cheerleaders (and the squadron coach, and the two drug addicts who were on the bus ride they are taking, and the bus driver, apparently, you will just sit) there and go-- WTF? The worst excuse for a wave of murders. The "actors" (two guesses for which I added the quotes) generally seemed like rejections of low-budget pornography, which they probably were. Those poor people, trying to get into the "legitimate" movie. One of my friends said this about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy who, you know, really gets into that, and his face turns red and all that." We had a good friend in that. Half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade "Annie" production that I just saw. The other half almost seemed bored with death (especially in the deleted scene, this redhead ...), and for ten minutes in this film I was also. <br /> <br /> A note: the DVD contains a deleted scene, which would have put the R-rated movie to NC-17 if it had been left. It was completely free and, as entertainment for adults, has no quality. The only reason to bother with that is to laugh a lot at the badness.
