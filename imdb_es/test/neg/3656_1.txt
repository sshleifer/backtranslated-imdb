After reading the back of the box, the first thing I thought was that it is probably a blow from Saw 2. It could not be further from the truth. It seemed to me that they had given someone with a camera phone and $ 10.00 and asked them to make a movie. The plot did not exist and neither the performance. It was almost as if I was watching a silent movie about the growth of the grass. I was not at all surprised to find out later that the whole movie was "improvised". At the end of this "movie", he had lost the will to live and could have contracted AIDS just to see this piece of cinematic garbage. It was about 70 minutes that I could have spent doing something that was less painful. Like jumping from a building.
