This is a fair movie, good for only once. The plot itself is quite well crafted for an image of this type, which is a pleasant surprise, like the performance, which although it is a bit hammy, is better than normal for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are hilarious: a translucent giant and a polystyrene / papier-mache hand shamelessly shaking unconvincingly on a piece of wire. <br /> <br /> Definitely, you have to keep an eye on the value of kitsch entertainment. <br /> <br /> / 10.
