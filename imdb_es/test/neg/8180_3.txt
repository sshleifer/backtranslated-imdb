Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has made some amazing demented visions of the future. This movie, however, was boring pretentious shit. The opening scene showed great promise for what the cover and description promise a surreal live action style. I feel like I got that with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With Red Spectacles I just felt motivated to feel uncomfortable about wanting what the hell it was. The film made little sense to me and I could not care less about the people around her. All this would be fine if the film were an effective art. While the opening scene seemed interesting and the scene with the giant person in the robot suit holding the giant machine gun in the rain seemed cold, he did not see the movie that was worth watching.
