Like most musicals of the time, one should check reality at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is neither remotely credible nor plausible, but a little funny in its strange form. This movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars. Some scenes simply happen as if they were in a review, not a movie based on the plot. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it's a shame she has so little to do unless there's a lot left on the floor of the cutting room. <br /> <br /> One of the most insane events is the way Eleanor Powell gets a lead role in a Broadway show and Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, work from dawn until dusk. Several scenes pass and there is no work, there are no essays ... NOTHING. She needs money to win a horse at auction. She has no money. Do not they pay her while she rehearses? Taylor has to borrow money to help. It is supposed to be a great producer of time. He does not have any money??? Anyway, they are only two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are wonderful, which prevents them from being lost completely. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better than Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
