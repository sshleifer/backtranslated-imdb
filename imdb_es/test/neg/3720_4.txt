The gentle and gentle Edward G. Robinson (as Wilbert Winkle) decides to give up his job at the bank and do what he wants, open a repair shop "fix it" behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married, but without children; He has made friends with local orphanage resident Ted Donaldson (as Barry). The young Donaldson is an enthusiastic workshop assistant, and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's pressing wife, Ruth Warwick (since Amy) is not happy with Robinson's choice of work, and conspires to return the matter to her idea of ​​normalcy. Their lives are interrupted even more when Robinson is recruited. <br /> <br /> The war also interrupts what could have been an interesting story, while the character of Robinson fights against a dominant and unfriendly wife. Possibly, the filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and redirect lives positively. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has an unfavorable part. The end of the "trick" played by Mrs. Warwick and Donaldson is predictably organized.
