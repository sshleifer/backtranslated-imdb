I have too few to add to what all the other reviewers have already made more than clear! This movie is horrible! More than horrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they still have to find a term to describe the terrible "Skeleton Man". In case you expect your movies to have a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible. Of course, many people are being killed by this skeleton-puppet with a ridiculous cape, but no one bothers to explain properly what it is, where it comes from or why it is so angry with the world. It looks like a cross between Skeletor from "Masters of the Universe" and the "Sleepy Hollow" rider and runs back and forth in an abandoned desert. The configuration of "Skeleton Man" is another totally delayed aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the film took place on a small isolated island, but it simply reproduced on the continent where the luxury highways cross the forest and the power plants are located at the end of the forest! Hey, why do they all pretend to be stuck when there are like a million escape routes? Anyway, after a couple of completely random murders, a special command squadron, led by poor Michael Rooker, arrives to hunt down a monster they know nothing about. It's really funny how each member of this squad presents himself as the expert in a given field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, a mock instructor ...), but they ALL die before any of them they are able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills! The gods of horror must really hate Casper Van Dien, since he is also present, portraying a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the road, but is somehow catapulted into the middle of the forest to die there. Right, that makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal great phrases from "Predator", the bonehead horse constantly changes color, the helicopters are shot down with bow and arrows, the common bullets cause the trees to explode and the flashbacks of Vietnam are completely useless. . I say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic movie in the top 100 of IMDb as soon as possible!
