The best I can say about this horror-porn movie is: boobies boobies boobies! <br /> <br /> Beyond that, this movie is made by a Hindu / Indian guy with a background in porn movies or something like that. <Br /> <br /> Argument: the host of a talk show and his girlfriend are harassed by a psychopath who is angry about the plight of the homeless and takes them out, guess, beautiful real estate ladies ! (Movies like these are the reason why 80's movies have a reputation for misogyny) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a Slasher, but it has the same kind of implausibilities and stereotypes: the dumb cops , the villain is an old white man, and the women are busty. <br /> <br /> If you like horror porn, this is your movie, otherwise, go away. (Adrienne fans can see their sagging breasts for a second or two)
