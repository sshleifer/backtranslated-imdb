I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We really wanted to do it, but if my children had not been there, my husband and I would have left. Coming from a farming community, we found that the fact that all the male bovines in the film that have their udders drawn on them was a bit unsettling. We felt as if we were watching the cows crossing or something like that. It was strange to hear a masculine voice coming from a female body. After reviewing some of the production notes on a different website, I felt that the animators could have been wrong with this fact. I know this is just a lively and humorous show, but by placing parts of the female body on a man, I had to suspend my disbelief so much that I could not enjoy the movie as I could have done. I know that udders can be found funny but they were definitely used to excess. None of the other animals in the film seemed to have genre-specific body parts drawn and I would have preferred that the bulls in this show have at least the correct ones if they were to be drawn. However, the children still enjoyed the movie, but then we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
