A man (Goffredo Unger) is floating in the sea among the wreckage of his destroyed ship, just off the coast of Florida. A helicopter attacks him only to reveal that both legs are missing below the knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner, Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) are marine biologists of some kind and are conducting research at sea regarding the Dolphins. While at sea, Hogan hears a strange sharp noise. Intrigued, he and Stella hired Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to locate and track the source, or something like that, since it is not particularly clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart) who works at a rival organization called 'West Ocean International' is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone inside the organization. More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is in the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra threw themselves into the sea. Very soon they find evidence that something monstrous and very hostile may be lurking below the surface. Together with the rival scientist, Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the United States Army, set out to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces at work, since someone does not want the genetically modified creature be exposed to nowhere. cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr., it is far from the classic Italian horror and splash movies of the 70s and early 80s. The script by Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is terribly slow and will make the Most people sleep well before the 90 minutes of execution have elapsed. The monster is hardly used, a large part of this movie is made up of images of boats and helicopters. The great fragments of the first half are concentrated in the not so mysterious part of the story "who is behind". There really is nothing to talk about, a man with both legs bitten and someone with an arm is about that. The special effects on the monster itself are generally poor and show up in very fast, disappointing flashes. The cast of anyone's virtual does not help make it easier to sit down. There really is not much to recommend this movie, so I will not. Do not bother, you can do much better.
