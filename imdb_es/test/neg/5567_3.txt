In the early 00s, the production companies had a short life for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" became hits, so several films were illuminated or they were saved from their "direct to the video" destination. However, France, unlike the USA. UU., The United Kingdom or Italy, has little tradition of fantasy films B and quickly it turned out that "Samouraïs", "Bloody Mallory" or the sequel to "Crimson Rivers" were ill-advised attempts to recreate a type of magic that had never Existed in the French cinema in the first place. As they failed, the producers returned to their usual fare: derived farces or the tenth self-referential homage to the French New Wave by a former critic of "Les Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could only have been illuminated in green during this short window, since it serves no other discernible purpose. It's his slasher movie of mixed books with vague mythological elements and horror references and you'll find female bimbosco characters, a French university that looks like a US campus. UU And plot so lazy that he does not even care because he had guessed only an hour before, even before the movie starts. <br /> <br /> These elements make all the fun of a B movie of the 70s or 80s and you wait for them in a movie of the 70s or 80s. However, we are no longer in the 80s and nobody warned the director Doug Headline, since this tribute to the genre of slasher movies is nothing more than a film derived from slasher. Headline is novice and has been writing as a critic on this type of images since the early 80s, but as a director for the first time shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" a bore. <br /> <br /> When you create clichés from a subcategory of the film and deliver them to a skilled and inventive director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or a "Death Proof", movies that are imitations of old guilty pleasures, but also Magnify these clichés and add a lot. That's called "talent" and that's why you can not confuse these recent films with their original inspirations taken decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements of past films (unfortunately for the male spectator, free nudity is mostly missing). There are very strong similarities (presumably unintentional) between the plot of "Brocéliande" and the vilified "Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch", since both deal with evil supernatural druidic rituals and some silly attempt to dominate the world on Halloween night . As even the plot of "Halloween 3" makes more sense than this, it means that something really bad came out with "Brocéliande".
