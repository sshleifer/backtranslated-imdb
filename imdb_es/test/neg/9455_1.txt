Purchased for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The performance of the wood, the lame effects and a terrible story add up to be a film that you do not have to want to see. PV is one of those movies that do not even have the kindness to be bad in a nice way, instead, this bile seems to try to become as offensively boring, stupid and trashy as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum that sells to the elderly as a life enhancer, and those who take it are under their control. A former lab intern associates with a nurse to try to stop him. Someone should have stopped the creators of this garbage. <br /> <br /> No one has any reason to see this movie, and I am really dismayed by the human race because, at the time of writing this article, 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10.
