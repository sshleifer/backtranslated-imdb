The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on the Troma DVD is disappointing. This seems to be a censored impression to watch television. Some of the most violent scenes have been edited and parts of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who has seen the uncut movie will be very angry with this toxic version of DVD. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD with the original theatrical cut. However, even as it was published on DVD, the film remains one of the best depictions of bushranger life in 19th century Australia. After having toured the old Melbourne prison, with death masks of convicts on display, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
