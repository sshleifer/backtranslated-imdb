After having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi, I was waiting for this third part of Qatsi's trilogy and see what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent "civilized warfare" in the form of sport, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks the global reach and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is a chaos, but even wars have an objective in mind and this film had little structure and unclear objectives. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi has flaws in being a chaotic mix of images that does little to develop its theme. On the positive side, he wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times I had to remind myself that I was not watching an ad that promoted Americans. Lifestyle. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "War on Terror". By representing "sport as war," the logos of the prominent team ensured that the United States was represented as the winner. Therefore, the opportunity to describe some of the many sports around the world was lost and to show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized war. <br /> <br /> In addition to the news, the video seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of New York and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. The gallery of faces (wax figures) gave a nod to the existence of important people outside the US. UU The manufacturers did not understand that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Philip Glass sounded like all the other Philip Glass scores I've heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and, at best, can be described as "harmless" that it does not add or dismiss chaotic images.
