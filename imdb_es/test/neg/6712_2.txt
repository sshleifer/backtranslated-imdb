Why the hell five United States repeat this? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book that is read in a language you've never heard of and that looks like nothing. <br /> <br /> You'll see ninety minutes of changing locations, most of them will be flown later in the movie. Right at the beginning, you see a small typical Berry farm, which is found in the film that moved near Paris but does not survive very well the "transport" to the Ile de France: it explodes 1 minute later. There are also two gangsters who do not have languages, as if that made sense in the world of SMS and Internet, much less in pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It just keeps going like this, nothing makes sense in this story. My only credit is for the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
