I rated this movie with a 3 and that was generous. The landscape is heavy and striking, the performance for the most part is terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good acting job (Tiberius), but he must have felt mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, however brief his appearance in the film, still seemed to be playing a role for Hamlet. The hard parts of pornography were not erotic or did much to promote the story. Okay, Malcolm McDowell had a nice ass and the boy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudio, was more like the traditional representations of Nero and certainly disagreed with Claudio's photography by Robert Graves. The climatic murder (?) Of Caligula, wife and son is inaccurate, since it shows him after death lying on the stairs in an outdoor area, when in fact he was killed in an underground passage in the palatine hill that ran to along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where virtually anything attracted my attention, merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonio or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch the "Salo" by Passolini, but get away from this movie.
