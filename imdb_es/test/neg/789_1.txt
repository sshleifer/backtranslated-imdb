I like movies, but I did not find anything that I liked about The Box. He was interested in the 'hook' of the plot, but unfortunately he never went anywhere and it was impossible to follow him. Anyone who says they understand that this movie is probably faking it so they can feel part of something, well, I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only background in this film is that women are to blame for the original sin and corruption of humanity. I've heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense. It is true that this movie is different from many movies that are currently shown in theaters, but that does not make it worth the price of the ticket.
