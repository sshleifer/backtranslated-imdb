This tale of terror takes place in the Namib desert, in Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow) is sent to a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the desert, fighting sand flies and whipping and blowing sand. There are four diamond seekers ... well, what remains of his scattered bones are discovered. During a long cold night in the desert, a monster that changes shape makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and the members of the unit die horribly one by one. There is no development of the character; let alone talk about the dialogue. The desert established in its own way is beautiful and without revealing anything ... the creature is as old as the sands of the desert. Also in the cast are Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
