<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (to Leoni (Family Man) <br /> <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE DINOSAUR MEDIA ISLAND, but nobody would have to see the film, in this sequel, a group of rag-tag visits the island of the dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim from an accident delta wing. <br /> <br /> ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports that JP3 started filming without a full script, which explains why the movie seems to have little or no other purpose than to demonstrate the state of the film. Of course, there are some clever scenes and some moderately funny fragments, but there is no significant plot to join them, the dinosaur puppets and the JP3 animation are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever, the cinematic experience can not contain a Candle in the original JURASSIC PARK or even in JP2. < br /> <br /> JP3 is a brief minute of mercy, of which the last 10 minutes are cred. their. Even with that, I found myself frequently looking at my wristwatch. The audience with which I saw him left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> A better bet: watch the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
