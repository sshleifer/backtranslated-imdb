Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Credulity Thriller from the pioneering team of producers of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, also known as The Filmmakers (with Lupino launching with some uncredited direction). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the "danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" in this entry in the "woman in danger" style movie. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a psychotic little hand drifter with strong injuries (noooo, Ryan? I know, it's hard to believe). Lupine is the lonely widow of the war, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to work at home. Things go downhill from there when Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has an unpleasant secret, it's not that he could reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. Keeping it, that's it. He has the unfortunate habit of coming and finding his employers dead. This is part of the problem of the movie. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he was free to roam from one city to another without hindrance, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He can not remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. Their violent, threatening and antisocial tendencies are triggered by the smallest and most common things (a young girl flirting, the deficiencies related to the war, due to her refusal to serve). I do not know how he managed to get through the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but nevertheless you left yourself alone for a while, could not you find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. It feels like he's exaggerating his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the bursts of dementia tightly twisted have a feeling of robotics that has been there, done, done. At this point in his career, he had probably played this character, to some extent, ten times, and it shows. We are encouraged to feel empathy with Howard (I did not) through fragments of humanity shown, such as a music box has stopped him in his tracks and is related to a group of children who will not judge him. Lupino only has to act exhausted and in distress, which is more than capable and does. <br /> <br /> The image had one thing in its favor; What would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So, naturally, there was a disappointing end that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Of slight interest was a recurring motif in which the camera captured Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree ornaments). This indicated that something was happening, or was going to continue, in his head. Horner (Vicki, 1953), who made his reputation in production design, does a good job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit too, the always reliable RKO art department for work at home. In the end, work below the standards of the directors, who have much better films to their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
