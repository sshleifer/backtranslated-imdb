It is a film that sheds light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but it does not show the true feelings of the people at that time and how they were tricked into believing that they could return home soon. does not mention the massacres committed by Jews such as Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any fighter for Palestinian freedom; lacks credibility on the real Palestinian struggle and on anything Palestinian; Palestinian citizens who end up as refugees in nearby Arab countries, the film focuses on the story of the man in a coma in which he is currently and, through his story, we see the film. The film only tells the life of a person and has some scenes of nudity that are irrelevant to the story.
