I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 by Outerspace, etc. And this movie fits perfectly. Do not believe anyone who tells you that this is a good movie. It is downright horrible. The accent of Tim Curry moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language of the monkey. There is a scene with a murderous hippopotamus that moves around a river like a great white shark. There are people jumping up and down the hill. Kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous So ridiculous it was rolling on the floor. It is totally unlikely. I loved every minute of it.
