I tried. Actually, I really tried to think of something that deserved a higher rating than two. It's not that I do not understand, I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is childish in construction, long and painfully disconnected. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are from the school of thought of Alfred Hitchcock "Do not tell him, prove it". then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be pressed. <br /> <br /> First, The Terrorizers tries a stream of consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but does not have much skill to do so. (Maybe it gets better with age, I do not know, since I have not tried with other Yang films yet). The point is that it uses the shortage of "show, do not tell" that really only serves to interrupt the procession. of history. Sure, it gets into some visually attractive images, but they do not gather the story, and they do not help to improve it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main concept behind the stream of consciousness and "show, do not say" is that with the right images, the right drama, the repetition and the close correlation, the viewer can make their own inferences; It does not mean that these will be the right inferences, but that they can be amended as the story progresses, and each director should strive for some of this type of interaction with the audience. In this, Edward Yang deeply disappoints. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be attracted, there is no reason to consider the characters or their motives, there is no reason to get emotionally involved, and really, there is no reason to be alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang gets lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story that the film itself is telling. His art moves in one direction, but like a big dog that he can not control, he is constantly pulling the lead, trying to return to the course he wants, not the one he is following naturally. The most notorious example of this is the end. The end really should have happened at the time of the revelation of the husband. We have already been told the end of the book in which the film is centered (and, by extension, a possible ending to the film). If Yang had chosen to finish at that point, he would have had a much more powerful piece, leaving the observer in suspense. Is history played as the book says, or does Yang's "real world" play differently? Asking the viewer to think about this is the kind of spectator interaction that Yang needs in pain. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, forcing the natural conclusion for the sake of what. For the mere fact of persisting in a main character, we did not need to know more about her superficially, and Yang would not feel the need to tell us if he had not turned it into a sheet instead of annoying Make him a more attractive and profound character to get started. <br /> <br /> Why does Yang prolong and torture his movie? To get more of those "visually stunning images". The movie really suffers for it. He wants to finish, he has a conclusion that seems natural and leaves the viewer unresolved, but instead, Yang goes ahead. Instead, Yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer, causing him or her to constantly ask "so what?" The first ending, which Yang ignored, was good. The second ending, well, my thought was "so what? Who cares?", Because it's not like I'm introducing something that has not been exposed in the story ... but the last ending? That really was a waste of time. Not only did the "real" ending leave me disconnected, but I also felt that it was an affront to what the story could have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the conclusion that he had insisted all along. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film has nothing to do with the film itself, but its post-production. The subbing (if you see it subbed) is horrible. Long sentences stay up for a second or two, while short ones stay up for too long. Also, as Yang quickly changes the images, the subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare instances where subtitles should be able to remain on the screen even when the image has changed, because there is not much dialogue anyway.
