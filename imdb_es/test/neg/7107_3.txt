The film is very fast, strange and colorful, it's like Mad Max in speed with tons of dyes and makeup. Also very caricaturesque, as it was said; Cartoon sequence appears here and there. The plot is also very daring, but I think it also means to be. What really drives me crazy in this movie, are the characters, they are painfully irritating, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty, she is really annoying (I think she is the most annoying creature I've ever seen). The edition is also annoying, very stylized of MTV. Another thing that is missing in Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. Humor is not very funny either. However, it has some nice visual effects. <br /> <br /> However, a lot of people love this movie, most of them are women, and that's not uncommon at all, because this movie is all about female power. Tank Girl this is a real girl movie, and the best example of a hate / love movie.
