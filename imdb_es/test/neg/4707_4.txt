I just finished seeing Goliath Awaits that I ordered in my library. I remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to see it with my son. Anyway, the movie lasted less than 2 hours and I thought it was much longer when I saw it for the first time. The back of the VHS box indicates that Goliath "contains a Nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." The divers were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document. There was not even talk about recovering this document. In addition, the box says that "the insatiable caldera of the bestial ship feeds on human blood". That would make this a horror movie and there was nothing revealed in the film about it either. I can not remember the details when I saw him years ago on television ... but could the back of this box be true? Maybe the 3-hour movie revealed more details ?? <br /> <br /> Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this.
