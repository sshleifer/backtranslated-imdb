This is really a new version that should never have come out of the barn. It has two models that act in completely different layers. At the top of his game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. All the nuances of the Franks are in sight. Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts are at the bottom of the rock. I can not imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts are working on their antimagic. Gilbert ruins every scene he is in. It's like the father knows best in the ghetto. She is Ann Frank light. His career towards Helen Keller was thin but not horrible. This is a sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm simply annoying. She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman, whose flirtatious and unsatisfied presence caused so many problems in Hetcherchis. This had to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what was voluptuous. Your weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part very well. Roberts was at his best when this was done, getting a lot of press and many opportunities. Her performance here shamefully shows her weakness as an actress. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville, have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and although they are strong, they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their peers. Reville is a cunning actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He does not get support from Gilbert. She drains the color of each scene. <br /> <br /> I have read with dismay the comments of those of you who grew up watching this version, full of attachment to these performances. It's a lesson in how the first version you see is attached to you. It makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products that I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to see the original. It has very few weak points and is way above this mess.
