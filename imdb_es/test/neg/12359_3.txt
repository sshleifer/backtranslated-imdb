So I understood this afternoon as "What Lies Above" and I saw it because the beginning was promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is an expert in mountain climbing ... but that does not help her when her boyfriend Brian gets hurt in a climb. When he goes to seek help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, and he will never see him again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she will not get close to Snowman. Happen. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells him that he can find the body of his lost fianc√© with a new satellite program. She agrees and they leave the mountain with Curt's two assistants: her "bodyguard" Hugo and the computer genius Tyler. From the beginning, you know there are other hidden motives, but unfortunately the turns are not good and lead to a ridiculously bad pursuit sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main disappointments are the false leads, most of which have supernatural overtones that never materialize. The object of the sky that fell in the mountains (which turns out not to be so supernatural), the story of how the Snowman Pass came and the most memorable of all: the dream sequence of Diana in the middle of the film. But what disappointed me most is where they threw the ball. Most of the film revolves around the search for Brian, so I can not, for my life, begin to understand why the mystery of what happened to him exactly and where he was never resolved throughout the course of the movie. This was the main plot. That's how the movie started! How not to wrap that up? <br /> <br /> I would not tell many people to bother with this ...
