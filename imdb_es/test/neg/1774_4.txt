Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I like the boy His films give them a certain style that is not really produced by the director or producer, but by him! Recycled plots ... check. Scams of best movies ... check. Wood acting ... check. It is not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he has been effective in the luster of Hollywood as Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow), he simply has not been offered a script worthy of his talent; and yes, he has another talent for acting that is not very attractive. This film offers a slight hint of what Van Dien can offer, but is stuck with the production of everything. The script can be developed better (see Oliver Stone's U-turn). The address can be better used (see From dusk to dawn by Robert Rodriguez). The PD could have made the desert more exotic (go to Russ Meyer's fastest Pussycat, kill faster!). This script is weak because this is something we've seen before many other times, so double / triple crosses are expected. The address is weak because it offers nothing new and telegraphs many of the weak writing moments. Cinematography sometimes gives a beautiful autumn desert flavor, but other times it does not take advantage of the scorching light and the initial sequence is horrible in cornflower blue. <br /> <br /> Now to the performance. .. Van Dien shows some grace and charisma to his Jake. He does not get too methodical or too corny in his role. A good balance, especially because the rest of the cast seems to be too distracted as to how they should act in this film (bad script or bad direction ... your opinion). The only person worth mentioning is the villain of Bryan Brown, since he provides the only real credit for acting in this film ... aspiring actors forget to try to learn to act on the green screen, they try to learn to act with a horrible script and take notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. It adds a greater depth to its paper and is a good counterpart of the character of Van Dien. Jake always seems to be one step ahead or control any situation if it is beyond his control. The fatal woman is weak (after all, it's a black desert) and is another nail in the coffin of this movie (you decide ... script or direction). The character of Rosalita should have been pushed forward in the movie instead of being pushed to the back of the story later to make room for the real femme fatale. So look at the Van Dien and Brown movie; and for fun, try to jump a stone through the holes of the plot inside the movie.
