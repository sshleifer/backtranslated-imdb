This movie really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message or an intelligent script. Far from there. I kept wondering what went wrong behind the scenes at Sam Hill. Clearly, something was wrong from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the positive comments of the film and the performance of Jodie Foster. From the first moment, it was clear that Foster had called this one. A previous comment even made a favorable mention of his facial expressions. I must have been watching a different movie, since Mrs. Foster (usually a favorite) seemed totally disinterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward seems to be distracted by his lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with enthusiasm. The moment he is called to participate in a supposedly desperate search for fugitive Foster, Ward also seems to have become embarrassingly unenthusiastic about the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional interpreter, so I did not expect much from him ... and he complied. <br /> <br /> Yes, this left me thinking long after it ended. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real bad smell for everyone involved. But then learning that the Director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym says a lot. <br /> <br /> But why are you listening to me? I always think that Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but it's sensational in lace underwear.
