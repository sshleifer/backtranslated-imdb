I have seen many movies in my time and this really stands out as the worst movie made in the history of cinema anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to see this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, possibly because I was already tired because it was late at night. The second effort I managed to overcome the 35 minutes, but again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on like this, but I think you understand the point ... nothing ever happens in this movie. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. Look at it and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can spend 40 minutes in this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of everything, then you're a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is that 0 was not provided as an option. I just thought that the world needed to be warned before hiring or, even worse, buying this garbage. THEN!
