It is a complete nonsense. I have studied Nazism and read many manuscripts of the day: the "parallels" use most of the classic apocryphal myths degraded from Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is designed for an audience of Polly-Anna's complacency, which feeds heavily on bad words, horribly thought-out arguments, irrational conclusions, misconceptions and meaningless logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this peace so successful? Easy. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done; What a bonus? That is, who benefits, in the long term? <br /> <br /> It does not. Sacrifice money and rights. Muslims do not, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer this, and you have unlocked an important door.
