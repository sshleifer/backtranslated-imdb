I expected much more from this movie than I actually got. The performance was horrible of all and the story was far from impressive. It cost me a lot, not even to follow what was happening because I was so nervous. An example of the performance is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset with the South Vietnamese colonel so he throws some sand from the "sand map". It was impossible to have an idea of ​​what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea how I'm supposed to feel about Vann. Obviously he presents himself as the protagonist, but as soon as he arrives in Vietnam, he starts a romance with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the movie had done was that it was not particularly boring. I give it 4 stars out of 10.
