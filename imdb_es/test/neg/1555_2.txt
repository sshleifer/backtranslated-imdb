First, let me clarify that I am a big fan of science fiction, especially when it comes to giant monsters and trampling. But this one is so fantastically lame that I do not even like it for being bad. Apparently, they did not save enough budget money by skimping on the accessories (the only accessory we have to indicate that the size of the alien girl is a large pencil, available in the Spencer Gifts for about fifteen dollars), they also decided not to To disburse by concept or plot. The monster looks good, in my opinion, but it does not have enough interaction with the funds, that is, there is not enough destruction to adapt to the majority of the fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is: if you do not have many fake-looking buildings to destroy, then you'd better have another fake-looking monster to fight with. This movie has neither one nor the other. I can not present my final complaint about the film without revealing the end, but it is enough to say the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it, simply not to retain the water. Not even as good as most of these movies. Skip it.
