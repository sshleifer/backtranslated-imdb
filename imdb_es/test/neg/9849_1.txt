There are so many things wrong with this movie that I do not even know where to start. History is not cohesive at all. I guarantee that five minutes from the movie, the average viewer will scratch his head confused. <br /> <br /> This is what I remember of the film before I was bored to the unconsciousness: an almost abusive father persecutes some pre-adolescent Sisters through a house, but after all it turns out that they are not so abusive. In the next scene, the girls are approximately 15 years old. They drive with their parents and collide with a deer. The deer must have been explosive because its car explodes, one sister drags the other of the burning remains. Then, the girls move in a boat on a lake and make a great plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, the girls hitchhike to a military base. And what military base it is. Actually, it's more like a pig farm converted to look like a military base with a lot of confused extras playing "soldiers". The base commander's office is particularly impressive because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a sergeant's hat mounted on a plaque Then there's a random guy pushing a motorcycle and the base commander orders him to go "to the city" to buy some pornography magazines and make sure the soldiers do not think he's in the "pink team" So our character takes a converted truck to look like an army truck "to the city" and loads a box of an indescribable "bookstore" with an inflatable doll on the front door. stop to pant, and look through the cache of pornography to find items inside as the "anal invader." I guess it's enough of the plot to scare most people aside, the quality of the sound is terrible and the movie is full of corny attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher who talks about the forbidden fruits during the scene in which the "dirty" sister encounters the main character for the first time, or how the camera persists. Too much time in certain shots to try to convey a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see this for sale, rent or whatever, stay away. It's not worth the money in both cases.
