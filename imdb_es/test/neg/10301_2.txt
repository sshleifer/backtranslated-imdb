I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and I also worked at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston, during Allison. First the hospital takes are sadly suburban. The Medical Center of Texas has a population density during the day similar to Wall Street! There are huge skyscrapers of professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest children's hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is larger than the Memphis skyline. However, the best photos that Hollywood could gather are those of a small hospital in the middle of nowhere (in addition to the real image of the hospital taken decades ago). In addition, they combined several characters from real life and represented them all in one (super-nurse). Actually, I know the medical technologists who work at the blood bank. Two of them were actually working at that time, but the movie shows only one pregnant MT. There was one pregnant MT and another MT that took the precious rolodex of the patient's antibody (research "alloantibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the real-life lab scene. Hollywood combined these two technologies (most likely saving time and money). In the film, the (real) military helicopters had to transfer our babies (NICU and PICU) to UTMB to Galveston. Why can you ask, when we have the largest children's hospital on the same street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read well, they refused! Being employed by them, I was embarrassed. Needless to say, I am no longer affiliated with that facility. Any other comments would be repetitive for those already published by the people who actually live here or who lived the experience.
