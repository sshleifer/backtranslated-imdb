"The threat" is not funny. He tries hard, too hard. but it rarely brings a smile. No action, only robbery. One of the main characters carries a stupid grin on his face throughout the film. Without a doubt, as the Wayans brothers, less talented, starred, wrote and produced the film, they were totally blind to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Menace consists of a series of similes, a joke. The auction line can be seen a mile away, but you have to wait until everything is developed. No zippy one-liners or quick dialog here. Only one scene after another building the joke. The jokes themselves are youthful. Loc Dog (the one with the perma grimace) talks to a beautiful woman, but then she has ... bad breath and then she takes off her nose and then, wait (remember you must always be impatient) she gets spoiled! How funny is that? Ten-year-olds can find it funny, since they will not have heard the jokes so many times before. Alternatively, if you like to watch movies completely drunk or drugged, you can follow them and you may find it fun. The challenge will be to get drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without fainting.
