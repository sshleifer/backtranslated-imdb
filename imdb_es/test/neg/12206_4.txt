The director Delbert Mann was a director much better than what this film indicates. He directed EVERY QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, THAT TOUCHED THE MIND, AND THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON, among others. This mediocre, made for the television recount of Dicken's masterpiece is so bad, even those who are not familiar with the story filmed often, will be dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that the film is available only from two well-known suppliers (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC) the poor quality of the transfer and the scarce and confusing sound track make the task of finding this Video movie is not worth it. <br /> <br /> I have always believed that if a company is To put a film on video and charge the public to buy it, then they should have at least one copy of the film and do a good job in the transfer. Unfortunately, neither of the two providers has a work ethic and the result is only suitable for the local discount store box. <br /> <br /> The story is told mainly through flashbacks, making the film somewhat episodic and very talented. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles and others have been cut and the relationship between young David and Steerforth has not been explored enough, so we wonder why David would go out with the boy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David The boy and the young In√©s never develop and it is difficult to understand why she and David finally get married. Since Martha stays outside, it is a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely man. <br /> <br /> Some have credited this film for doing a good job to shorten the long novel. I do not agree, this is, in the best of cases, an ax job in the book. Anyone who has seen George Cukor's version of 1935 will agree. <br /> <br /> The performances in that version of Fields like Micawber and Rathbone like Murdstone, are definitely worth seeing. And the most recent versions of Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are outstanding achievements in terms of television adaptations of classic novels. The directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak who are responsible for those films deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My last comment about David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Do not buy it, there are several much better versions of the movie. available. If it is on television, turn the channel to something else. It's a waste of an hour and twenty minutes of your life. I'm sorry, but I can not praise a movie so frightfully bad.
