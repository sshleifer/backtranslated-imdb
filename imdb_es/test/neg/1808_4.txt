After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the movie did not do it justice. The film embarrasses the book and anyone who has not experienced the book would disapprove the story and the plot because the film portrayed it so badly. In the film, the characters and the set were just some of the disappointments that occurred in the film. The director omitted so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made. <br /> <br /> Of course, any book is better than the movie, but they were not even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and in the intelligence of the written word. The movie does not even begin to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes in the book were completely excluded, such as when Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also, when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intention, she reacted differently in the film, instead of the book. Another important difference was that Marlow saw the image of the blindfolded lady at the end of the film, not at the beginning, like the book. This influenced the way the audience perceived Marlow, and the movie ruined it completely. <br /> <br /> The book was so in tune about the appearance of each location, but the setting of the film was a disappointment. There was a lot of false funds and to praise, a lot of bad actors who accompanied him. There was an exception to the horrible actors and that would be Isaach De Bankol√©, who played Mfumu. His character was represented the best. Although the movie was not so good, I would still recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way, you can see what the differences are in the movie and the book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book, I do not recommend the film because it is a boring and lifeless mess. I loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
