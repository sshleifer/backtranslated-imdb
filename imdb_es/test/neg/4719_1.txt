this movie is what happens when people see how in this particular Blair Witch project and says: demons, people running with cameras, acting with an oblique bar, without any problem, I can do it and start with an unconvincing idea, compose a terrible script and get a bunch of untalented actors and start shooting a movie. The plot is that in Africa there is one half of a race of men like animals that hunt and kill humans, the locals think it is a demon or an evil spirit, but our wild group is in Africa to get some proof of their property. It is not necessary that there are more words in the plot, this movie is 1 out of 10 and I am trying to find something good to say about this movie, but after a long time without thinking about anything nothing is null.
