Where do I start with Killing Mind before mentioning the good? This movie is about a young FBI woman with psychological profiles, or something like that, who for some reason is going to work for the LAPD for a while. There are some recognizable faces, like the "I love you, man" guy from Wayne's World, playing a policeman (also at the age of the beard!) And two guys who always seem to play the police playing ... you guessed it , cops One of them was one of the cops at Gross Point Blank who was following John Cusack on the place, and the other is the FBI guy with specifications on Final Destination, who is also on the Fugitive as another cop. I know that the FBI, the Marshalls of the USA. UU., The CIA, etc. They are not policemen, but they are all the same. To a certain extent, they enforce the law, which makes them policemen in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of police you want, they are seen as those who are trying to take down the bad guys. Anyone, I'm rambling. The woman is working with these policemen who seem to be sitting in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that has not been examined by yonks. She saw the body as a child, so naturally she decided that she could reopen the case because she was personally linked to it! I also like how the person who described the psychological state of other people witnessed a murder scene as a child. Surely that's the kind of thing that can fuck someone's head. She starts asking questions of a journalist who covered the story when she was open, even though she seems to be the same age as the woman, so she was probably writing for a newspaper when she was 10, or writing some school reports. in it, and she decided that he would be the best person to ask about it. <br /> <br /> Then we see that, in addition to reopening homicide cases 25 years earlier, she tries to prevent theft. A really discreet guy runs down a busy street wearing a balaclava. Way to mix, asshole! Anyway, she and the policemen who are eating ice cream in the park chase him, and while crossing a bridge with a woman and a boy standing on him, the thief grabs the baby from the arms of the mother and throws it into the river . This, if you have not guessed yet, is the best of the movie. I'm not sadistic, and I have no hatred for babies or anything, but the scene seems so stupid. I promise you'll wet your pants laughing at her if you watch this movie. It gets better when the Final Destination & the Fugitive policeman jumps to rescue the baby and then tells his friend: "It's a baby!" As I did not know that before jumping, it surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she chases the thief, but loses it. Later, she remembers that a random dog did not bark at the thief, so she assumed it must be his and decided to track the thief through the dog. The dog had no marks or anything on it, so I did not know how to find the dog and, therefore, finding the thief is another question I will not ask. Shortly after this I stopped looking. The story was moving very slowly, and after I stopped laughing with the baby I was pulling, I lost interest and I missed what was said. <br /> <br /> That said, I'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist type because he seemed a little aloof, and she spent a lot of time with him, and anyone who watches Columbo knows that the person who is outside the police force and who spends more time with the investigator is the bad guy. . Also, other people's reviews say that the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> So, in general, a movie of pants, but it's worth seeing only for that glorious scene.
