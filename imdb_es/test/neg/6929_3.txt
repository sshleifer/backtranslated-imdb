I loved the book "Una princesita" for most of my life, and I was very excited that there was a movie. But I was horrified at this adaptation. The performance is not only wooden, and the plot is an overwhelming mix of several incidents in the book, but the subject is totally wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves as such, as Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar, even when she herself is very hungry. The theme of the film seems to be that all the girls are princesses, which considerably cheapens Sara's actions, and it seems that it should be written on a Hallmark card than in this story. <br /> <br /> There are many others. Things are wrong with this movie, too many to list, but here are some of the biggest: this story should be set in Britain in the mid-nineteenth century, not in the United States during the first world war. Miss Minchen is hard on Sara from the beginning, which makes her actions when Sara is penniless far less surprising than they would be if it were sweet at first, as it is supposed to be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father * does not * return, he is dead. He is his closest friend, and collaborator in the diamond mines, who finds Sara and returns her to his place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, although they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> Throughout all that Sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a "two-faced bully." Such a thing is completely out of place for her, and undermines the whole philosophy that she must behave well no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen. Have I ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "She Haunted" and "The Continuing Story of Anne of Green Gables") The plot of the book is wonderful and skillfully written, so I do not understand why the director felt it should be done . It will be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone who wants to know this story should see the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better yet, read the book. Your time will be more valuable than the hour and a half lost in this version of the movie.
