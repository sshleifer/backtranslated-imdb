I thought this is an awesome boring movie! I heard that the director can not speak in French, so he let his actors say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as always, but I can not say the same of other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to be very tired, this is one of the arguments of the film: tired of being together, of living abroad, of their life in general; So they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy ... <br /> <br /> I gave him 4, due to some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
