For a really wonderful movie, you can also try to watch the film about San Francisco de As√≠s, good for any audience. The best thing that I liked about this movie was the landscape of Mexico, and it makes the film reach a 2. I was surprised that these actors did not have a terrible sunburn, they were not desert inhabitants. And it is said that Moses has an impediment to speak, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle" scenes were devised and not credible. And what is the point if you can believe something in a television story? Speaking of falling asleep, I thought that this movie made by Hallmark was pathetic, and I can see why others hate Hollywood. Not me, just some of these corporate profit seekers. You do not have to be any kind of religious to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored, with nothing to do, silly and religious. And for a real movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a movie with a very high rating.
