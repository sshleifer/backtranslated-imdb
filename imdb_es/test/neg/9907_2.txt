The only reason I know this movie exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had been doing since she finished The Facts of Life. When I searched for his name, this relatively new television movie appeared. After much research, I managed to locate a copy and was completely disappointed with what I saw. D Acting grade, bad script, terrible effects, it was like watching a more toned and dazed version of Day After Tomorrow that lasted 3 hours. Despite the long execution time, the characters are still underdeveloped, we do not care about them in the least and in most cases we long for their disappearance. Combine that with terrible lighting and cinematography, and you will have a real mess in a movie. The way in which they faced so many "name" actors (ie, Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in that garbage is mind-boggling. In short, I want those 3 hours of my life back!
