Cobb. He sucked. I did not learn anything about the man I had not heard before. The performances were exaggerated. A scene in which Cobb and Al drive down a snowy road in search of women in Reno has to be one of the worst scenes conceived in recent memory. It's just stupid and not entertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. If I had seen the same picture of Cobb fighting with someone on a base one more time, I would have become physically ill. By watching this 'movie', we learn NOTHING about what it was like in the Cobb era. We do not learn anything about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a coach, nothing about his relationship with his family members, apart from that: "they do not like it". I thought that when I sat down to watch this movie, I would learn SOMETHING about the baseball era in which Cobb played. Instead, all I could see was a new version of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (sarcasm pretended). Cobb is depicted as a constant liar in the movie, so which of his stories is supposed to be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? Nobody will do it after seeing this piece of shit. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure that the fast forward button on your VCR is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully one day someone will make a GOOD movie about Ty Cobb. I liked this movie as much as the people who liked Cobb in it, that is, I hated it. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE, GET ONE FREE section of the video store. I think I'll ask the video secretary for the return of my fifty cents, since I can not recover the time I wasted seeing this garbage. Oh, well, what could he have been thinking about a movie he would present to Robert Wuhl?
