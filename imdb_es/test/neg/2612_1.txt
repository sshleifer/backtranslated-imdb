This seventh (yes, you read correctly, the seventh) Puppet Master movie shows how the insane group of dolls emerged; by a French puppeteer who uses them to avenge a group of ancient mummies who persecute him once they discover that he keeps the secret of life. It was taught by a sorcerer, also fleeing, before he died. He used this power to bring normal puppets to life. This sequel is basically nonsense, even more nonsense like most of the sequels of Puppet Master. Due to the PG13 rating, we did not even receive entertaining puppet murders. Now that I think about it, there are NO damn puppet murders. If there was a franchise that needed to be cut, it would be this one. No more ... God, please no more ...
