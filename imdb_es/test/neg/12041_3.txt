"Los Ã¡ngeles de Carlito" is a parody of "Charlie's Angels" that does not even fear itself, but that does not mean that the film is above the criticism of the audience, it is amateur and juvenile -the movement " it stopped being fun around 1914.) The assault of rap music often stifles dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, though it only lasts an hour! The girls are hot and adorable, with thin bodies and wonderful, and although they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination.When I checked their pages of IMDb, I discovered that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is going through a film career, I wish her luck, because although this movie is bad , she (like the other girls) gave her all the energy she has and I would not mind at all seeing her again on the screen.
