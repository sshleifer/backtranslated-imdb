I rented this movie the other day because I love romantic stories, but this has to be the worst I've ever seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after they have hardly said more than two words when she has a great boyfriend for a long time who is completely dedicated to her. I thought Kelley was a jerk in the whole movie, and it never changed at all. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did a wonderful job as an actor, and I'm going to start watching more of his movies.
