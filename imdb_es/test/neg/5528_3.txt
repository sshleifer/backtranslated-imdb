... but memorable because it includes an actor that I really recognize! James Horan is, for this kind of film standards, Lawrence Olivier. He's given some decent performances on things like Highlander and several Star Treks, so it's kind of funny, if depressing, to see him demean himself here. Okay, yes, there is a plot. The character of Horan and his wife are fighting, he is having an affair with a movie critic while trying to make his movie "master", and his guest decides to enjoy the wonders of undressing. But observing Horan is really the only pleasure that can be found here.
