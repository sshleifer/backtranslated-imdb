Honestly, I was a big fan of the 'Stay Alive' trailer when it was released, even a few months before. I kept telling my friend how this movie has a great plot of history, and maybe a good one. Anyway, this movie is a little below my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential, but how the story unfolds, along with acting, direction and bad CGI, this movie is a disaster. The ghost does not make any sense, and include the murders, everything is too hasty, creating a sense of "unrealistic" in the minds of the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie may scare some audiences, but fear in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc.) instead of enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie. <br /> <br /> I should consider again the possibility of watching this movie.
