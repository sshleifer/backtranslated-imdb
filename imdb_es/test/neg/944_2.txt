Seriously, I do not understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. Either he has the best agent in Hollywood, or he recently sold his soul to Satan. It is almost unbearable to see on the screen, has little or no charisma, and a terrible comedy time. The only movie that I've tried to anchor and that I've enjoyed remotely was On Hold ... and that's almost only because I've worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Apart from its terrible advantage, this movie has many other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean I have to completely insult our intelligence, and write so incredibly trite that it borders on the offensive. The considerable talent of Lewis Black is also wasted here, since he is in his most incendiary position when he has no restrictions, which the PG-13 classification certainly does not allow. The only bright spot in the film was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the meantime). His only lines were funny at one time, but they certainly were not enough to make this anywhere more bearable. If you just want to completely turn off your brain (or better yet, do not have one) then you might like this, but I can not recommend it.
