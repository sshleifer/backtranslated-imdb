"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid movie from the popular Carrot Top comic (also seen in the commercials of 1-800-COLLECT). He plays a surf inventor who meets a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him out and a few days later discovers that the guy died and has given his company to the comedian. Even if someone else were in the role of Carrot Top, it would still have been bad. The jokes (which are constantly rigged) are terrible and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot twist" should have been ruled out. DO NOT LOOK!!!
