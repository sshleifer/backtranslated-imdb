A pig-tailed Linnea Quigley drinks milk, naked and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after having sex. She goes to an asylum, makes a best friend of Amy (Karen Russell) and the two blackmail to leave a mental institution sleeping with their psychologists (one is interpreted by the "Carol Burnett Show", the usual Lyle Wagoner). On the outside, these two mafia princesses who hate men (!) Stop taking their medications and invite six ex boyfriends of balls to their big country house for a party in which they are systematically murdered in a very bloody way for a glove, mysterious leather killer. <br /> <br /> The horrible David Barton FX is so bloody, but so unrealistic that it acquires a surreal quality. The same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and stylized, the film so inept that it walks and is edited, and the performance of another world, will begin to doubt their own sanity. This movie really tries to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but everything is so badly managed that it's almost like what would happen if Ed Wood rewrote a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman. And like any good Bergman movie, it has a mature moral to fulfill. Any good party needs a suitable "ratio" of boy / girl, so there will be enough girls to "tickle your lizard". See for yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> The linnea (the only reason why I was interested to see this to begin with) is very funny, it has much more dialogue than usual. and has several amazing nude scenes. Unfortunately, she also disappears completely from the last third of this movie and the film suffers for it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 of 10
