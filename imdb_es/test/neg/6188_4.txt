Eric Idle, Robbie Coltraine, Janet Suzman, it should have been almost impossible to be wrong. Of course, it has some fun moments: the scene in the showers when Robbie Coltraine echoes Lon Chaney Jr.'s horrible werewolf line "I can not help it" is very funny. But ultimately, the plot, the script and the direction are flat like a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "Hail Mary". As a child, Carry On's films filled this niche a little better, which is a sad accusation of a movie with such a promising cast.
