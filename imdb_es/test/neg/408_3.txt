Angels and demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I do not know what it is exactly, but something has gone very wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent work director. Although he will never be confused with an artistic sage, both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent movies, Parenthood was quite good and even the prequel / sequel of Angels and Demons The Da Vinci Code was a fun game. Also, none of his films have been downright horrible. (Note that I have not seen How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor its most recent film, Heidi Montag says No to Plastic). In addition, Howard managed to maintain this quality in genres as complex as the bait Oscar (A Beautiful Mind), a costume drama star-driven (Far and Away), fantasy of revenge driven by stars (Ransom) and comedies on prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. The scenes are too dark, the camera angles are wrong, the actors block the shots of each and the whole thing is often out of focus. This makes the narration of a confused story even more confusing. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is very popular, but I thought the Da Vinci Code is a fun and easy to read game (so I'm sued). The film version of the Da Vinci code stayed the same as the next vibe in the book and added an engaging cast and attractive shooting at the location. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons, however, take place in the claustrophobic confines of In Vatican City, and since Howard was not allowed to film in many of the real places, we ended up running a lot in a CGI batch . The whole movie is like Rick Steves making a Vatican City special and instead of visiting the Holy City and pointing to his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second-hand art book with all the tits erased . <br /> <br /> While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again I am sued), the story of Demons and Angels consists of an Illuminati plot (eyes now blank) ) to destroy the Vatican. His idea was to take positions in deaf schools around the world and rape all the students in the ass repeatedly. Ups my bad; Apparently, the Vatican does not need help with that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, his plan is to infiltrate the Large Hadron Collider in Europe, kill the main priest and steal three vials of antimatter. This raises more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create antimatter? Can you capture the antimatter once created? Why is the EU picking it up? (Maybe they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-materia is gathering a priest from the Vatican? Now, once they get antimatter, they will use their incredible destructive power to conquer the world. no just kidding; unfortunately, the Illuminati have not yet understood the level of sophistication of Pinky and Brain. Instead, the current Pope has just died and it is time for the conclave. The main cardinals planted for the last four popes of the tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one in the style of the Seven. However, being good sports are leaving clues in each murder as a Latin-themed Riddler. Oh, and the last abducted cardinal has antimatter and, if he is not on time, Rick Steves will have to go directly to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there were some Latin-themed Batman to save the day? Well, the story is really horrible and it is badly told, but maybe this is one of those movies saved by great performances. A true study of the character? (Okay, you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and he just looks awful (he's too old to play the character for about twenty years). His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the personal assistant / boy in the Pope's cabin as an Irish man who seems to be about to enter a musical number at any time, as long as no one steals his Lucky Charms. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd takes a good turn as head of Vatican Security and, as far as we know, no deaf children were raped during the filming of this film that puts him ahead of his critics of the Vatican in at least one area.
