Another one of those flimsy stories along with the most forgettable musical numbers. Powell and O'Keefe as combat publicists are pretty forgettable. However, there are two brilliant moments. Hubert's castle is the most incredible tightrope walker I've ever seen, its "drunken walk" in the cable has to be the most spectacular piece of balance ever recorded in a movie. Must be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker making a spin near the end of the movie. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her great talent to be herself, well, charisma is not learned, it has it or it does not. A great lesson for all aspiring cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his last cameo is completely forgettable.
