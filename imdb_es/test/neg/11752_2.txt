I know that the original Psycho was a classic and redoing it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a remake shot by shot. I think that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there is much more wrong with this movie than just that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was filmed in black and white, but, from what few people realize, the original was filmed AFTER the film was invented in color. The choice of the black and white film was partly a matter of budget, but it was also a stylistic choice for Hitchcock. Now, this does not mean that the new version should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this film are too erroneous. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green, particularly in Marion, which is not supposed to be a striking character. Bright colors make it look like a happy movie and, when horrendous events occur in these color combinations, it looks more like a caricature and the audience is inclined to laugh instead of scream. <br /> <br /> The second problem is lighting. This is a dark and dark tale that should be highlighted with dim light, but this remake not only seems to fail in this, but it seems to go in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the scenes are very well lit, even at times when it is illogical to do so because it is at NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is the performance of Vince Vaughn. Yes, he distances Norman Bate's discomfort and madness pretty well, I do not deny that. But there is an element in the character that he could not show: the softness. There must be a certain misleading friendship for the character, at least at the beginning, which then vanishes once we realize the truth about him. Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates, this is a trait of recognized character of ALL PSYCHOPATHS. <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects of this movie. Some of the performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn was very close to achieving a decent representation of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were very good together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious, but, unlike Janet Leigh, who was announced as one of the film's biggest stars, Anne Heche was given the last account in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed that it was not a remake of Hitchcock's film but a new adaptation of the original novel. Now I wish I had bought that book and saved the comment because, after watching this movie, that comment is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. There was no attempt in this film to hide the fact that it was a scam from the original, and it would be much more credible if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he really was a three-ton monkey from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without any real thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. Like the scene in which Sam and Lila talk while their faces are completely covered in shadows. Hitchcock covered the faces of these actors in the shade because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that nobody could see their horrible performances, not for any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, My criticism is as useless as the film itself, as it replicates something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I recommend you not waste your time on this film and get the original.
