ZERO stars out of **** <br /> <br /> Endless Descent has absolutely no redeeming value, whether it's the ridiculously bad performance, the ridiculously horrible special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script or the annoying musical Score . It's the kind of regrettable production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could have the slightest consideration of being illuminated by a studio in the first place. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll delve into the plot other than saying that it's a group of people who are trapped underwater and have to kill many creatures of false appearance. <br /> <br /> Let me go into more detail about what is so horrible about this movie. In the first place, the performance is simply horrendous. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a feat that is quite difficult to achieve as it is. The support actions are not really better. And what about the actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high-pitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy, not a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are even worse. The creatures range from strange-looking eels to giant starfish and "most mosquitoes". The effects seem to be something that would be seen in a muppet movie, and I do not think I need to go deeper into this topic. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has a mild cult status due to all the terrible movies he has done. fact. I'm sure some will enjoy Endless Descent in an Ed Wood way, but I do not even think it's that good. Everything he does is of poor quality, especially camera work. Man can not direct a movie, that's all. <br /> <br /> This was the last of the four films that took place underwater, and in fact makes Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad films in their own right) begin to look magical in comparison . Either way, just stay with the Abyss.
