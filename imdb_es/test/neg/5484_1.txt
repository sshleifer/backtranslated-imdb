Remember when Rick Mercer was fun? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it and Made In Canada was also a great show once. Talking with the Americans was a very funny special too. But as my friend said "Rick Mercer woke up one day and it was not funny anymore" I think that day was when the Rick Mercer Report aired. What is the point of this show? Rick Mercer reads outrageous fake headlines, shows pictures of bad sheds that people send by mail and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30-minute show and just talks to people who expect to say something witty or smart enough to watch TV and maybe someone Somewhere he laughs. We're supposed to be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of his movements, and then suck on purpose while trying to be "fun" desperately. Rick Mercer grew old or simply lost interest or just is not fun anymore. Even its classic fragments have lost all their bite and humor. The same can be said for the CBC comedy in general, because for how many years have been playing Air Farce on television to offer the same types of useless jokes?
