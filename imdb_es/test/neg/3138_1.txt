I've seen this at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and I've left the cinema in the middle of this "movie" (with a group of other people), so maybe it's not the right one to comment on, but I think the fact of leaving " SC "That's enough reason to do it. "SOUTH CAROLINA." It is a different movie. People who need a coherent narrative, characters or a plot will not find anything in it. It is supposed to be an experimental film, which is based on the power of the images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention to simply outwit people, that they have nothing more to say. The gibberish of the external narrator is simply boring, the images are cheap. Okay, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why does it matter? Husseins film wants to be shocking and stimulating, instead it is boring and annoyed by its lack of creativity. Note: not all films without a story are art and there is no creativity in breaking taboos, especially if everything is performed as badly as in "S.C.". I would suggest that Director Hussein should visit a psychiatrist or a film school, before he again confuses garbage with art. Note: I do not want to see a baby being cut again during childbirth.
