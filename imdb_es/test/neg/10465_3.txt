All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's films, I really like them. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, which tried to be good. But this was hardly funny ... I mean, I suppose so, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks ... terrible. And the film has no blood, nor nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" that will not be a successful movie, probably will not have a smart script. A movie like this can depend on gore ... but no. It's not really based on anything, it's just ... shit. Take a look if you want to laugh. But do not expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski will see movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV again, because this and Komodo vs. Cobra is not cutting it.
