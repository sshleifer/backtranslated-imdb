Hard to believe, but it is! I should not be surprised Commercials try to show how unique and "fun" a show can be. However, not only the ads that announced this new program have no humor for me, I have not talked to anyone who has found the ads fun. <br /> <br /> I never remember seeing a pilot so devoid of intelligence, tenderness or humor. The characters were unbearable for the most part. Especially that of Selma Blair (what is surprising is that she accepts to be in a fecal show of a show like this). The few moments in which the characters were slightly exchangeable were considerably trite and trite. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show without redeeming qualities at all. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly ONE redeeming quality, and that is Selma Blair. Despite wearing disgusting clothes and acting as an unfortunate and stupid excuse for a young girl who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at Selma, go rent Hellboy. At least you will keep a minimum of respect for her instead of tearing this abominable character in your brain to associate with her. <br /> <br /> In short, Kath and Kim are a waste and really epitomize the worst. Television is or has ever been. Establish a new minimum.
