I can not see why someone would make a movie like that. From beginning to end, this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are very shallow, terribly acted and frankly annoying. There is absolutely nothing at all below the surface, either with the characters or the plot. <br /> <br /> The 'humor' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience (I suppose because of language and nudity) although it is mainly about toilet humor and would have problems even to draw a smile from a 16 year old man half witty. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing at all that attracts a movie fan. Laughs nonexistent and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask: "Why has this movie been made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I hope in the fullness of time to see this movie beating the film. Top 100 worst movies.
