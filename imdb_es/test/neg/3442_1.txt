Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeemer as an actor or person. The only movie he enjoys is "Galaxy Quest" and that's only because his character, a drunk and drunken actor from an old TV show, was so close to real life for him. The rest of the cast is equally bad. I hate the mother and the actress who played Patricia Richardson, she sucks! There is always a cliché, the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares for her children, while in real life she proclaims family values ​​and divorces after having twins. And the children's actors were as interesting as a root canal.
