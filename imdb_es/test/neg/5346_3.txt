I just lost my Saturday night watching this shit! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, from "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (from "X-Files"), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl in the credit; a very reasonable IMDb index (5,6); and many good reviews in IMDb. To my utter surprise, the movie is horrible: the characters are poorly constructed; The story is about being funny, but it's totally silly; The character of Mercedes Ruehl is incredibly stupid for a Princeton professor. So, I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews and discovered that most of them are made by IMDb users who only have reviews, therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Sin retorno")
