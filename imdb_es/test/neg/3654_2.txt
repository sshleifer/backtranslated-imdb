This film has the feeling of being a university project about her, that wants to make a project of Blair's witch saw with a mountain theme. But it does not succeed. The cinematography is poor, and the acting even more. The characters, in my opinion, do not seem to be credible at all. The editing of the film is not working properly either. There are many negative effects that I think are put there to try to add a horrible effect. But for me, it just gives me a feeling of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this movie, unless you're a fan of the dedicated movie, who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. However, I think it's not worth watching this movie for the average person. You will not get any pleasure from the bad effects and the touch of the camera, which this film grants its viewers.
