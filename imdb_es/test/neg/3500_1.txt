A terrible, highly artificial writing of a "benefactor" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in L.A., or in the United States in the present. Positive comments are a mystery to me, but they can only be provided by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded no matter how superficial, simple and simply totally unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a movie that deals realistically with the problems of the modern career of the United States, the movie you should see (and probably already saw) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism with respect to the race in any of the two minutes of that film than in the full 4 hours (oh, I'm sorry, I only felt like 4 hours) of this stinker. <br /> <br /> If someone ever needs proof that the road to hell is full of good intentions, this is the movie for you.
