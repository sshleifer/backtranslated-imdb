This film is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who go to a small fort to seize a property of recently deceased uncles where they plan to settle. When they arrive in a nearby city, they find that no one will go there (even though it is only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they arrive there, they discover that there are no soldiers but a good number of people who have made use of the fort and built a small nearby town. They soon discover that something is not right here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom, as the locals call it) is in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of entering the plot, I will make some comments about the things I noticed about the film. First, the acting is very flat, only some of the people seem to be real enough to believe. My first performance was bad, but in the end I saw some of the shots and these same people came alive. So my only thought is that this is how the director wanted it. Besides the bad performance, I have a big problem in which people do not react correctly to a certain set of circumstances. Take, for example, no one would take them to Ft McMillan at any price, even though it is only 15 miles away. However, when we arrived at the Fort, we found that it is well maintained by a decent population, all of whom must obtain supplies from someone, not to mention the mail, etc. It is supposed to take place in 1867, however, we can see the The rail car has electric lights (at least they are not lit) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, it is not one of the general styles of locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see a paved tarmac (and maybe a car at any given time, did not want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. If they had followed the rules of the "world" they created and let the actors be actors, they could have got a 4 from me instead of the 2 I gave them, and they rewrote it 4 times more, I could have even done it better.
