Amazing. I never saw something like that. Everything is wrong; Very bad. From photography (many scenes without focus!) To acting (the young female is terrible). And what can we say about those helicopters made in Paint Brush ...? Really amazing B, I mean, movie Z. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, clich√© and poorly written. The basic comforts for the script seem to work. I can not even think of a young film student making this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not even think about watching this movie. Sleeping or playing alone are the best options. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
