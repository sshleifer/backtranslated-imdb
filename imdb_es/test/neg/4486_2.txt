The only reason I rated this movie as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is beautiful, however, the whole movie lacks emotion and was boring to watch. Usually, I love a good romance, but this was just a waste of time, I did not shed a tear even though it contained sad content, it just did not act very well. I'm not a film critic, but I only advise girls to avoid this really, unless the only reason you see it is to see Channing Tatum hahaha, the rest of the movie is trash and if he was not in it (not that his performance was good) He would have stopped seeing much faster. It's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this movie, it could have had the potential to be a real tug of tears. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a girls night in ... do not miss it !!
