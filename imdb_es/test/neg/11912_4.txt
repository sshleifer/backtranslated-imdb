The Shanghai Cobra begins as a gang, with a restaurant scene drenched in the rain directly from Shack Out in 101 or Gun Crazy (the first). Unfortunately, the film then proceeds at a slow pace through a standard Chan formula that is barely animated by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson spent half of his budget in the first five minutes, just setting it up as he wanted. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
