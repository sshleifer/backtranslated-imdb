This movie was * good * relatively during the first parts of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... none of that matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys. Although it was a great turn ... it was almost a terrible turn. I immediately lowered the rating of the 7 movie, maybe 8 to 3, according to the last 10 to 15 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else not see why the turn is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it's bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the hour and the previous twenty minutes. There is no connection with the murderers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two FBI agents are only 15 minutes from the previous hour and twenty minutes. <Br /> <br /> We got it ... vigilance ... Oh, the Assassins are voyeurs. WHAT SHOULD NOT HAVE SENSE, because they were only described in limited terms as simple psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance that we are observing of the 3 stories go out the window since they are all dead in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a group of FBI agents at the beginning ... what FBI agents sleep together? All in the same room. To be found and killed by amateurs and then personified by people who do not know anything about being agents of the FBI? A policeman 3 feet away, apparently, can not hit either of them with a standard pistol that can fire several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel that this could be real when they make absurd jumps that they think we will believe. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they reveal themselves as killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere ...
