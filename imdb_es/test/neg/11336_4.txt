This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters on the life of a common family in 1968, mainly as seen through the eyes of the youngest son. <br /> <br /> Based on a background of historical events, such as the student uprising in France in May 1968, the decadent Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to Spanish life in At that particular moment, one could consider this series as a simple compilation of the characteristic weaknesses that manifest in this type of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally treated in a light vein, although not missing in certain moments that could be called dramatic, the series seems to be aimed at people. of around fifty who can remember those moments, as it should be said, any younger person chooses to ignore such events or is busy with other things. <br /> <br /> The best that can be said about this series. It is the role of Ana Duato as mother of. three children: she does very well the part of the total housewife of the time, manifesting that peculiar Spanish inclination, especially remarkable among women, of letting all her thoughts and actions be carried forward by the impulse of her heart, without having to resort to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common meanings. Imanol Arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotypical police as in other television series. In fact, as an actor, you should not rely on anything other than a television series. Your resources are too limited; however, his part as a father of the working-class family is not all bad. <br /> <br /> It is not really recommended for other audiences, even Spanish speakers in Latin America: the themes are too parochially related to a specific Point in contemporary Spanish history, so that if the viewer did not live here at that moment , most of the references will be lost. It is even likely that certain situations that cause some smiles in Spanish will not mean anything to other viewers.
