Keys to the VIP is just another horrible TV and TV event you can see and see at this station. The show is terrible with players who claim to be real players competing with each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in stupid games in which they try to get the girls in a bar to talk to them, get girls' numbers, etc. . The judges are four other types who also claim to be experts in collecting artists, but they also look like just huge d-bags just like the contestants. The show is not fun at all and it's not even interesting, it's just boring to see these guys desperately trying to convince us of what incredible players they are (speaking even more of the four judges than the contestants). Nothing funny has happened in the shows I've seen and the shows are obviously manipulated. Do you really think that they invited all these people to the club, asked them to sign releases and record them while these guys carry out the same stupid games with them? It's not reality at all, it's just stupid, it's probably even recorded during the day. Someone else here wrote how they met someone on the show and everything was fake, well, that's obvious, it's a fake show and even with the actors it's still not funny. One of the worst shows I've seen.
