This movie was a bad movie. The plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver went awry. Accidents seem contrived and predictable. I thought the actors tried to some extent, but with this movie, it was so scarce that it can only go so far. One of the worst movies I've seen and I do not recommend it to anyone. The only accident of Mr. Accident was his release.
