Ted Nicolaou made many horror and fantasy movies. I'm looking for all your movies to watch. I could not find this for 3 years, until I found it unexpectedly on youtube. Truthfully, I wanted to see more ghosts and fewer conversations here. It seems that in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, maybe in money. Its characteristics of this time are more similar to the films of trash Thrash Z of low budget. But this time I'm not saying it's a bad director. Everything happens. The ending has some creepy details and suspense, but the whole movie was a long boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> just for real Ted fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
