After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers, we return to 1989, where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and her baby. In this version, the character of Loomis gets more scenes and seems much more proactive than him in the final cut. The Score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the BS electric guitars. And the end has a little more sense. For these reasons, along with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and cut the gore factor (Halloween, unlike "Franschise on Friday the 13th", it was never about flagrant gore) is the reason why I prefer this cut contraband. Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold, simply polishes it a little and makes it more understandable. The entire cult plot is still very stupid, like Micheal fathering a child <br /> <br /> My degree of cut from the producer: C- <br /> <br /> My degree of theatrical cut: D -
