Uzumaki, which translates to "spirals", comes to this new wave of Asian Horror films after hits like Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes) and much more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters ), falls short of the spooky and supernatural element of suspense so characteristic of the other films, the only thing that remains is the rarity and not of Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> It started with a girl, another boy in love with her, her best friend and her dad who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens concerns Uzumakis, the people die and you see Uzumakis. So, according to this, I'll have fun with the spirals myself, the characters do not seem to go anywhere, but I'll keep going. We discovered that the city is cursed by the Uzumakis, people start yelling at Uzumakis and the point is that the Uzumakis are everywhere, the film is a disaster, he does not know where to go, except to show him the power of the Uzumakis ! !!!!! There are some interesting concepts, such as when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis in her fingerprints, but then there is another scene in which she listens to her husband (from beyond the grave!), Tells him that she also has Uzumakis in his ear, the way they handled that scene was simply laughable, not even funny, there are also some (a little) of great visuals, like the collection that the father has of Uzumakis and the girl with the hair of Uzumakis ... yes , Uzumakis hair, is out However, it looks like it was taken from a Fruit Snack commercial where, if you eat an Uzumakis fruit snack, its taste is so incredible that your hair becomes Uzumakis, now if this was not enough bad, suddenly, out of nowhere. Is there Snail Men .. or ManSnails ?? whatever is?? And you know why? Right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ?? That only left me enough time for a horrible anti-climatic end and by that time I was fed up with the fucking uzumakis ... uzumaki here uzumaki there, of course, look around you, how many Uzumakis can you find? If you want to see a movie about spirals, go see PI (3.1416) now there you will find some very interesting uzumaki concepts between the meaning of life and Dark City also has some spiral. <Br /> <br /> This movie could have worked like a music video, it's already got a lot of cult followers and that's why I was forced to watch it, but after doing it, I'm not sure why people think it's cool. I was really disappointed.
