As a Christian, I found that this movie was completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, the writing sucked, the cinematography sucked, and the story was very typical. I could not say that this is a great witnessing tool, because I would feel very embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things, and that's because they invest the best in that. Christians put their work and think it's okay because "it's for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to God. David (or Saul ... I do not remember) spent what amounted to about $ 50 billion in today's money to build a temple for God. But these days, spending what seems to be around $ 30,000 at most to make a movie as a "witness" of people with people is simply pathetic. It is the person, not the product that affects someone. Do not waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. If you want to have a positive impact with people, show them movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc. movies that have something to say and that really transmit it to you.
