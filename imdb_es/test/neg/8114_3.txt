I'm sorry, but for a movie that's been stamped like a semi-classic and terrifying movie, but seriously, I think when the director makes me laugh without meaning to, that's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were so exaggerated and incredible. I just could not stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was like the British voice of a weeping girl. Not to mention that Malicai was too dramatic on her butt. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn is about a city where all children have killed adults and worship a God who orders them to sacrifice any person over 20 people. When a couple suffers a car accident, they go to the city for help, but, of course, they get caught in the children's trap and sacrifice themselves. But Malicai has other intentions when he is tired of following Issac's orders. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn could have been something great, but it became a bad movie that you can easily mock. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure this is not what I intended and it was a pretty boring story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, for a good laugh, look at it, but I warn you, it's quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
