I expected a graphic, sexual, and a rather rough comedy, classified as R, when I sat down to see this ... it turned out to be quite accurate ... only it was much more sickly and disgusting than I would have thought. I do not know if the director / writer Gregory Poirier is ill or is deeply sexually abused, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this one. I probably could have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was that it required a hard stomach ... but it is not. The movie is also horribly mean and disturbing ... every character who has more than a full second of screen time is an extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I do not know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but I just found it ... wrong. Simply wrong. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and misspelled ... all of them. There is not a single nice character in the movie. The humor is disgusting and goes too far. The movie is so incredibly wrong that I really do not think it's worth anybody's time. If you like raw R-rated comedies with lots of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, look at The Groomsmen, or, better yet, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But do not look at this. I can not describe how bad it is ... you should experience it for yourself. However, this is one of those moments when I will say that it is better that you ask. That way, you can imagine that this movie is very close to the bottom ... without knowing that it crosses it, and much lower than that. Most of the time, this movie looks like a group of horny teenage boys who got together, formed a film crew and every time one of them had an idea, they filmed it and then put it all together. It lacks structure, consistency and flavor. I recommend this only to the hot teen boys who have seen all the other R comedies and who do not care about quality. Everyone else ... does the sensible thing; avoid this It is not even worth seeing the loot. Believe me 1/10
