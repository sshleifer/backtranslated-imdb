Fake films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said: "Do not be stupid, be smart, come and join the Nazi party." He brought us lovely movies, like 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane!', And even 'Naked Gun'. But the good ones die young. Luckily, the genre managed to reach the end of the 90s. And then ... the Wayan brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'Scary movie'. Suddenly, the word parody was a hint of raw sexual jokes. Most of the films that claim to be fake have since followed his example, including 'Scary Movie 2', 'Date Movie' and the movie to kill the genre 'Epic Movie'. Sure, there have been some reliefs. There was 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Will Ferell has become a vehicle that simulates all sports imaginable. In addition, the Wayans Brothers abandoned the 'Scary Movies' and were created by the reliable Zucker Brothers. While these films have had some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically condemned to be films that are only loved by prepubertal men who have just discovered what an erection is. People who have not explored the term 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, 'The Comebacks' has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who starred in 'Anchorman' with Ferrell) leads a team of non-favorites to beat a coach (Carl Weathers of the fame of 'Happy Gilmore') that made him return to training. Koechner has shown promise as a supporting actor, but as the protagonist of this film, it sounds like a script. It sounds too much like I'm doing a cold reading with passion. In addition, the jokes about being a fallen coach, which throughout the film encourages the team to fail at school and then flee from the police in underwear, had already been done before. Yes, this is an imitation movie. But remember that even parodies can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a kind of sophisticated vision of modern society. In addition, confidence in stereotypes will not generate more laughter (who knew that a movie with people who speak jive could lead to stereotypes of gangsters (not really, but you see)). Although I admit that I laughed at least a couple of times ... it was not up to par. The soccer team itself had many stereotypes, including a Mexican, an arrogant athlete, a fat guy, the scrawny nerd and help for the mentally disabled. Even the only woman in the team was reduced to stereotyped female humor, mostly with little clothing and shedding insinuations. In fact, his character, like most others, never developed. It's a sad state of affairs for this movie. If only he were not so dependent on stupid sexual jokes, he could have done something by himself. In fact, this movie will probably be the target of jokes along with "Epic Movie" in the future. Koechner really deserved better. The script in general was ill-conceived, even naming the championship 'The Toilet Bowl'. Then yes. The falsified films are dying. There is a movie called 'Meet the Spartans' (ahead of the trend, boycott now!) Which is coming out and which includes a parody of the breakup of Britney Spears. So let those kids keep having erections ... but people grow up and lose them. We need sustenance. One day, they will learn to stop false parodies and restore them. Hopefully, one of the heroes will be 'Get Smart', created by maestro Mel Brooks, who will be released next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
