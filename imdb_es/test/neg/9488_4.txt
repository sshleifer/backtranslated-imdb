One of the most prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A female in a red shirt falls in love with Khan (instead of falling dead, for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a feature of nonexistent character in the ship. It makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this brilliant and supposedly used use of Starfleet to evaluate people when they hire personnel. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye", when a man in a red shirt takes the side of the enemy only because he falls in love! As in SS. (However, in that episode, betrayal plays a small role in the general plot). This is very silly because, once again, it makes Kirk's crew look like a group of dull, easy-to-impress idiots who, once they fall. In love with the enemy - they are capable of doing almost anything. The fact that McGivers returns to side with Kirk does not improve the illogical in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan kept behind a normal door when they know he has superior strength? That's one of the various ST tracing devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence, then one would expect him to be more cunning with the way he behaves. And what about a Sikh played with a Latin accent? Montalban should have received a vocal coach. I was almost waiting to hear "the plaaain! The plaaaain!" In the background at any time. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide unlimited use of the ship's library with regard to the most intimate technical details of the Company to ANYONE? Is Starfleet an institution formed only by idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is a very cartoonish and silly episode, so it's no wonder that the Trekkies adore him. It does not have too many elements of science fiction, which is what the Trekkies hate most. He also realizes that the ST franchise chose to revive this boring character for the second movie, thereby pleasing the rabid Trekkies, who were very disappointed with the first film that, as you guessed it, had too much science fiction to the small average. Brain trekkie.
