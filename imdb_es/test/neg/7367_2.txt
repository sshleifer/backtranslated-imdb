After the second one, the music swelled up (the second of the movie) and it was a pirate movie, I knew that I was going to have a very long trip. Horrible clich√© - (I laughed a lot and I knew how the plot ended WELL before it ended) - Louisbourg was not used particularly well and the costumes and hair were a bit horrible. (My favorite moment of makeup is that the only way in which Depardieu gets old as far as I could see was by putting a straight hair wig, instead of waving it). I could continue with the ridiculous inadequacy of music for a long time: the film could be massively improved with an eighteenth-century score. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's that horrible movie actor Patrick Doyle who is responsible for the score, do not say more.) You should not be allowed to be close to historical films, you should stick to the adjustments of the century XX). br /> <br /> The "visit to the portion of remarkable people" was also very fun, especially in his little visit to Madame Pompadour, which was not particularly convincing. <br /> <br /> I thought that the only actor that appeared in the century in question was Michael Maloney as James Murray. Absolutely stole the show during the 30 seconds it was on screen. Tragically, it made you see what the movie could have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had some heat, the two tracks were amazing together. <br /> <br /> The most horrible scene for historians is where they are at the big farewell dinner in Britain before Wolfe navigates, raise his glass and say the first two lines of "How to place the glass" , also known as "Why soldiers, why" as if it were a toast. Absolutely unbearable failure in historicity, much better to leave it out. Thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumor that Wolfe and the company sang it (probably drunk, not as stretched as this one). Crazy.
