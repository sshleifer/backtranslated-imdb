The young and honest insurance agent Ronald Reagan (as Eric Gregg) is optimistic, but poor. His wife, scheming Sheila Bromley (as Nona Gregg), longs for the best things in life. Describing herself as "not burdened with tons of justice," Mrs. Bromley begins to spend more money than Mr. Reagan earns. Bromley gets the best things in life, but puts the couple in debt. Bromley is a funny shrew. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women, such as the cheerful employee Gloria Blondell (as Patricia Carmody); but, he does not surrender. To pay the bills, Bromley becomes entangled in insurance fraud, which helps her lay off her husband. An unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted to a life of crime: will it still stand or will it be twisted? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents Will Happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
