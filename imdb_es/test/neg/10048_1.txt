The English translation of the title in the DVD version of this film is "Cemetery of horrors", but I think it must be a mistake. It should have been called "Horribles Cemetery." The horrible performance, the horrible edition, the horrible story and the horrible music make this horrible movie left in a horrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
