Well, since it's called Porno Holocaust and it's directed by Joe D'Amato, I went into this movie hoping for sleaze ... and even though I somehow managed to do it, Porno Holocaust was a big disappointment, since it's damned BORED. The title suggests that the film will include pornography, and that is not wrong. Porn Holocaust is pretty much just pornography, and most of it is the same thing over and over again, I quickly got ahead of myself before it was over. The first sex scene is between two women and I have high hopes, but after that it just degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the movie (during the first hour!) Consists of conversations, and you can imagine how much fun is to sit through! The plot centers on a desert island where, believe it or not, something strange is happening. Naturally, it is not long before a group of people, made up of a few men and some scientists, who turn out to be attractive women, land on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then, more than an hour later, they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies ... <br /> <br /> This must have seemed a good idea for an original porn: a zombie that likes to put on, but as expected, it does not work well at all. The movie is only ten minutes away from the two-hour mark, and that's too long for a movie like this. I have no idea why the Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; If they had cut out one minute of each sex scene, the movie would have lasted less than ninety minutes, and that would have made it much more tolerable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it takes a long time before there is a sexual break enough to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it finally appears, it's a big disappointment! I realize that this is a low-budget B movie crap, but D'Amato surely could have tried a little more and found something better than this. I will not even bother to mention the performance, the atmosphere, etc., it does not make sense. Porno The holocaust is basically your average boring porn movie with a slight spray of horror, and I can not recommend it!
