Undoubtedly, the biggest film waste of the year. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unpleasant characters. In addition to that, and perhaps the worst crime, it is uninteresting and very predictable. As soon as the character of Bill Pullman scribbled on the photo changing the word from "evidence" to "violence", I realized the whole plot. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to see this garbage. The only redemption feature for me is that I saw this for free on my HDNet cable and did not waste money. I would really be mad if I had paid to see him in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who labels this thriller really needs to get out more. A horrible movie, horrible in every way that matters.
