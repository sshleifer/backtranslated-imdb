This is the same old shit that comes off amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie. Wow, maybe that's why it's a direct aspiration movie to the video! <br /> <br /> I suppose it's my fault that I spend money to see it (one of the worst decisions I've made). What a waste. I usually like B movies, some of them are pretty good, but this is too ridiculous and stupid to be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this garbage deserve to be taken out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a film that obviously does not even deserve to be filmed! These so-called movie makers have absolutely NO talent! <br /> <br /> A stupid plot, a horrible performance (especially the drag queens - what does the senna look sexy?) script - it seems that the bull **** someone who invented in the act) <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this movie is its absolute lack of something well done. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail would it take to ensure that each frame of a movie is well below any reasonable standard? I do not think it is possible to make such a bad movie intentionally, and it is inconceivable that bad luck could produce such horrific results. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid this odor bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
