I only saw this movie late last night. I remember the exaggeration of its release and, to be honest, if I had seen it back then I might not have been so generous. I hate exaggerations, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie ignored the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was also good, though he still wondered if he was drugged all the time. It was never too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character disappointed me in the end. For me, I should have been more conflicted with Demi, maybe throwing her out or telling her that I had already paid. After all, he would have investigated them before making the proposal; that is not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to anyone. It was cruel to the point of breaking them and the last straw was the house and, however, did Demi fall in love with him? The passages that give an idea of ​​the relationship between Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was a deep depth that surpassed the superficiality of the character of John Gages. It really could have been much stronger and, as other people have alluded, I think the draw card for the films was Redford and they did not want to tarnish their "image". I say what the hell was Robert in this movie! The characters of Woody and Demi were naive in a sense, but I think that was very intentional to attract them to their situation and defend their decision. But the reality is that they were losing the house of their dreams and where did they go? Las Vegas? bet what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an incredibly wealthy billionaire. I found his ingenuity when Redford was seducing them a little too unrealistically. The movie could have been much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on nightly television, it was nice and if you do not think too much, it is also acceptable.
