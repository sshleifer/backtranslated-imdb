I've been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, looked at the specials and saw the story of Karen Carpenter. This movie really did not show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film, she seems to be shy and quite lonely (except for a girlfriend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was sociable and friendly. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her encounter with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, I saw a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she was going to go to her hotel room. In addition, Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could lose weight, but stopped taking them because the psychologist did not recommend her too. In addition, Karen's husband in the film is called Bob Knight, but in real life was called Tom Burris. In addition, Karen was not divorced from Tom, but was only separated. Karen must sign the divorce papers the day she died. In addition, Agnes found Karen naked in the darkness of the closet, unlike the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend seeing him.
