Total disgrace! Really horrible! The script and the dialogue is a joke, and is combined with a director who has no idea of ​​life in Saudi Arabia. It's not a surprise, it's quite Saudi, the director is Palestinian-Canadian, the writer is Lebanese, the main actress is Jordanian, and filming took place in Dubai, and all those elements are very good to make the movie a long way to represent Saudi society. Yes, it does contain some Saudi clichés, which we see in cartoons in newspapers every day, but that's it. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi society, or at least to give us something new and genuine about the problems and concerns of young people in Saudi Arabia, instead, it was copied and pasted here and there, and the result was a disaster. Even the supposed love story in the movie does not exist or at least we have not seen it. The only positive side of this total debacle is the good performance of the supporting cast. The veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a badly written role like that of a great father, who has clearly been mistreated, since he seems younger than the actor who plays his son. Also the actor who plays the role of fanatical brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, has done well, in fact, was the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, being professionals for a long time, did a good job, but the main actor, Hisham Abdulrahman, was bad. I had a look of an adorable little bobby for all situations. He could not even say his lines in an appropriate way. He has a charisma that earned him the title of Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and he's good at interviews and television shows, but he was the weakest link in this movie. The main actress did not care much, but even she acted badly in some scenes and exaggerated her sensuality unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> The film was a great success, Saudi Arabia came in thousands to neighboring Bahrain and Dubai attended it when it was screened there, and made a tone of money, then it was screened on pay per view, then on open television, and that was in a span of a few weeks. This was to charge the Saudis' enthusiasm for home entertainment, but unfortunately; The film was not homemade, nor entertaining.
