This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi B-movie is what I would have if I took an early Fred Olen Ray movie and brought out the fun. Or conversely, it's like a 'movie' by Uwe Boll but without so much ineptitude. A young convict of a nubile gang (C.C. Costigan) agrees to pose as a space marshal to stop Kim Dawson's extravagant plans to ... have everyone having sex with everyone else apparently (that vile demon). Anyone who participated in this movie in search of science fiction would be, well, you got what you deserved for not doing any homework in the movie. First, when Kim Dawson EVER starred in something other than the soft core Skinamax level shit. For that matter, take a look at Costigan's resume and the Director before making a hard decision saying he expected something more. Do not get me wrong, for a space / action / soft-core / titillation film, this movie is still not good, but if you expected something like "Contact", I do not pity you. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz-on-demand (available until December 8, 2005)
