I can not believe how many people refer to the main characters as "cows". there is no such thing people !!!! There are cows and bulls and all the males in the bovine species are bulls and they do not have udders !!!! There was even a real bull, but it was like another kind of animal completely! My God, this is like drawing human ears on a cat, tits on Superman or Mickey Mouse with blond curls at Shirley's temple. Even in animation, it just does not work! giving human qualities to animals is nothing new and hopefully, but changing their real bodies into basically a transsexual figure is strange to a family caricature: how many people, editors, writers, producers and animators saw this and knew nothing. Better or I did not say anything, it's completely amazing! I'm not a snob and I like the animations: simpsons, beavis and butthead, south park, even Ice Age and all the new ones out there. The coverage was great, but this is crazy, totally crazy, I could not accept it. that many people are so ignorant and I kept waiting for a reason for the udders in the film, an explanation, none of them came, and in the end, when they hold this little newborn calf, half of its belly is udder and they pronounce that it is a boy ' I almost choked Please, writer / creator let us in on the joke!
