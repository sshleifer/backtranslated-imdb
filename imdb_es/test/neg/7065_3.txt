This movie starts with an interesting stage design and a promising premise, but does not provide the products of the cult movie. Set in a harsh parallel universe in which everything belongs to the Corporation "Blump", it is a horrible comedian who finds success when he removes a third arm from his back. <br /> <br /> All the potential Here is the great cheese: Judd Nelson, washed star of the 80s, Wayne Newton, strange visuals and digressions of strange plots, obese women in sparse lingerie, necrophilia, but never worth it . <br /> <br /> The rhythm is the main problem. Each scene is extremely slow. Nelson's standing routines are supposed to be fun because pathetically they're not fun. But each performance is prolonged until it is not tangentially funny, just boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine that someone is telling you the longest and strangest joke you can imagine, full of self-congratulations for how funny and strange you think. Imagine after a stupid two hours of this, he never received a slam line. You just saved the trouble of watching The Dark Backward.
