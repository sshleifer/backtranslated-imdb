I can not believe that I got into this movie to achieve a favor that my friends ask me earlier this April 14, 2007. This movie is certainly a pain in your ass in the theater and boringly sick, I have not even felt the bloody impact. of his "discouraging scenes" that I consider a total failure to attract his audience. The worst even trampled me, because my friend did not arrive in time to the theater because she was busy helping her boyfriend in finding a suitable shelter to stay one night. I was not really disappointed with that issue, but this movie is really an issue for me, bad plot, useless story, naively created and I do not know what to say anymore. <br /> <br /> The title does not. I do not suggest, in any case, the chills and the horror that did not manage to shoot down the spectators, maybe the beating of the animals could cause more chills if the real situation shows it in the theaters. Good luck to anyone who tries to see it anyway.
