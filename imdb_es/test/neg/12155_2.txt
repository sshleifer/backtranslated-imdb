The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was not interesting, the film ended when it became Gingesh Khan, I always thought that something very interesting happened afterwards. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie was played have beautiful landscapes, but the film did not benefit from that. The jokes were really poor. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could have told a little more about history, traditions, etc. of Mongolia. My co-viewer did not know anything about it, so I was a little lost. I really wanted to see this movie, but I was very disappointed after all. It was one of every 3 movies I've seen in the movies and I considered leaving before the end.
