I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the movie, but with Today You Die, I think doing it would be a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here is a five. minute to point about how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There was a time in the mid-1980s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to break your ribs; a full pucker could knock you down. If it really caught you, it would take you like a twig. <br /> <br /> These days, although it is still capable of doing considerable damage, the part is no longer seen. He has gone to the seed and simply does not know when to leave it. He walks as if he had been thrown in his pants, but somehow he still manages to look constipated, and has gained weight. His long ponytail mark is gone, but his hair still looks stupid. The way this man continues to work in the film industry surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Today, Die you is the usual Seagal mix of bone-crunching fights, car accidents, battles with firearms and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles his way through boring writing, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or credibility. In this third-rate action movie, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief who tries to go in a straight line, who is tricked into participating in a $ 20,000,000 theft. He is caught, goes to jail, escapes and seeks revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are some car chases and fights with pretty good weapons that intermingle boring things (of which there are many), but reading other comments in IMDb reveals that they were actually taken from others. films. Seagal also has a lot of bodies in it. <br /> <br /> Seagal becomes one of the most terrible acts of his career, and that is saying something, considering the bad 'performance' in some of his recent efforts The most hilarious is his totally shameful attempt at Ebonics (African-American street slang). 'I da man, fo' sho 'no, actually Steven, you sound like an imbecile! With a ridiculous script and plot lines that do not go anywhere, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment, where Harlan Banks saves the closing of a children's home, is enough to make you explode. <br /> <br /> Damn it, I just looked at the clock. I enjoyed destroying this pile of steaming dreck, I spent more than five minutes. It's time to post this comment and see something decent.
