This is possibly the worst movie I've seen. I would think you could get that from the title. In addition, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of cinema. I can not even remember why I saw this movie or when. It's just an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the rarest and absolute movie to lose two hours of your time, then, of course, rent it. Good luck finding it in your local store. I doubt that this movie is in a very wide distribution. And, please, do not show this to the children in any way, since it can distort their impressionable minds forever.
