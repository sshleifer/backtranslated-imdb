The Big Knife, a film about the dark side of the Hollywood film industry, is ironically much more like a movie than a movie in itself. Apart from a few very brief expositive scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the hero of the film, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants to get out of his contract with his studio due to the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they publish. His wife again, beside herself (Ida Lupino) is also fed up with the study, not to mention the ways in which her husband makes fun of her. Unfortunately for both, the head of the studio (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. It has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it's only a matter of time before I push the man too far. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, I repeat NO, a black movie. Rather, it is an exceptionally theatrical lounge melodrama. The plot advances at a snail's pace, and is so intricate and confusing that it is in a violent lack of harmony with the static configuration and the blocking of the real scenes, carefully devised. The performance is extremely exaggerated, and sharply deviates between histrionics and out of it and softer soliloquies, but no less subtle, which obviously must be touching, but which present themselves as a pretentious mosque, especially in the hands of the unfortunate little word. Aldrich was obviously doing his best for a stylized "something" here, but I doubt even he knew what it was, and certainly the audience never does. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that movies and plays are very different media. What might have worked in a play was not remotely natural or plausible in the film. The result? A great waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
