Humor is a very individual thing and the audience in the preview of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than me. It seemed to me an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old racial humor of the Australian cinema of the sixties and seventies. The plot of the boy knows the girl never takes off due to the lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos, while I found laughter on the floor. If you want to spend your money on this, wait until you are in the video.
