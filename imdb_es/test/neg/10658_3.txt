Two redeeming qualities of this film were cinematic photography and a difficult story to resist. However, the script, the direction and some scenes were horrible. I was wondering why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity that underlies the plot of the film, but they knew that the film was full of flaws. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better, and it reached a wider audience accordingly. What makes me think that this is that with all the problems of the movie, some scenes that are painfully hard to see, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would be solved.
