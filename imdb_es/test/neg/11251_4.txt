The plot involves a new and modern franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's hair salon. Then, he feels he has to change and improve his store by getting newer things and things like that. It sounds very exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, it is largely the same material as the first film. People who work at Calvin stand up, talk loudly and talk to each other and to customers. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was a little funny, but it's more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything related to the movie. And Calvin faces another moral problem that involves taking a large sum of money. He already showed that he will do the right thing in the end. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I do not recommend it unless you think that the first Barbershop was the best since the bread was cut.
