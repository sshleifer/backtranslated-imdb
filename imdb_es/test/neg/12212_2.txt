James Marsh's The King is a film that baffles me. I can not think what it's for. It is a story about a young man named Elvis, played by Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, who gets an honorable discharge after 3 years of service in the Navy and then goes to find his biological father and behaves dishonorably with him and his family . Everything is quite sick actually. Elvis makes his way into the family by seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It is quite impossible to identify with anyone in this movie from here in central England. Father preacher and joyful and cheerful Christian congregation; I could not figure out if the movie is meant to make fun of them for their meaningless beliefs. Or is the target happy family and we are destined to think that that is unfeasible. Or he is simply saying that some people are lost and that they are bent on destruction. It's shallow We all know bad things happen; The interesting thing is to know why, but this movie simply represents gratuitous violence without ever unraveling the thought that has led it. "The king" is such a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; the Warrior's Code; the changing concepts of value; Killings of honor in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this movie simply does not add anything to the notion. However, Pablo the Projectionist did more than his meager role suggests. The DVD Projector showed all the films in a green tone and the only way to repair it was by sending it to Belgium. He did it during Christmas. I think those postal workers, repairers and Paul went way beyond duty and our reward was this grim film. But could you see it in another way?
