Being a Steve Martin fan for a long time, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliche script. The scriptwriter must have rented some videos and have taken one piece here and another there. Without a doubt, it is the least imaginative film I've seen in a long time. He knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it appeared. it started. The stereotypes and references of African American slaves are also quite offensive. But the worst thing for me was to see Martin in a movie without a trace of wit. Probably one of the most intelligent actors and here he sold himself totally to a completely silent script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a meager effort.
