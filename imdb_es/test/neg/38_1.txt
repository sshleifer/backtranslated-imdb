I only came here to look for an alternative title at the Terror Hospital, so I would know what not to pick up. Not only do I get the original title, but I come to find that Terror Hospital is one of the seven most common aliases. This is a real mess. In general, movies like this can be forgiven for many reasons, mostly due to unintended consequences of the show at all production levels that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mainly entertainment. This does not have any of that. Instead, the viewer witnesses unnecessarily unnecessary and too convenient exposure to the situation and scenes drawn from characters moving cautiously from one room to another, and all this is half the movie. Forget about trying to find out where someone is (or who they are) during dark or night scenes, too; You probably will not mind, anyway. There is also a random sequence of car chases that seems pretty boring compared to some of the old movies of the driver that I write ... I mean I sat and watched in high school. Actually, we are talking about mysticism, possession and an assassin that is loose here, it is not a bad recipe for trash cinema. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to make it even "good" garbage; When they join the aforementioned, the bad performance and the not so special effects are just that: the bad performance and the not so special effects. This is just garbage, pure and simple. Leave it on the shelf in the pawnshop or in that box at the garage sale. There is a reason why it is there ...
