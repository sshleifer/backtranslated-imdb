Where to start, where to start ... mmm ... well, how about some of the most rigid, unnatural, incredible and camping performances that one can imagine? What about stereotyped "characters", situations and locations? Or what about a manipulative script, cloying and completely unhappy? I can not think of an element of this film that was original, worth seeing or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all of you, fans of Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski: enjoy your fifteen collective minutes, friends, because they will not be famous much longer ...
