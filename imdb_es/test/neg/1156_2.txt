I'm a big fan of horror movies and I know a lot of information about serial killers. Obviously, the director refused to investigate the film he was creating, because half the movie was fictional. More than that, Ed Gein's character was portrayed in the wrong light. I did not rent the movie to worry about the Deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to see Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was horrible, the only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore was not so bad. Acting = horrors Actors = subpair film = loss of time. <br /> <br /> A great disgust, but I will not abandon my search for a good horror movie.
