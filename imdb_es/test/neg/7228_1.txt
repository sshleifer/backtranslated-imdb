Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines, and this garbage not only deserves one, I will begin with the following: 1. I voted INCREDIBLE for this terrible "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys that Mr. David Varod produces are mainly triggered in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (only in BTW, for illiterates around the world.) This country is IN EUROPE , based in the north to Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and began to make shit releases, mainly live to video. Because here? Because here they pay very low fees to the Bulgarian team and Bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished) who are, in many ways, better than most of their American colleagues. Personally I am ashamed of that fact. The reason is, of course, the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to get most, if not all, of the gain. Actually it would not be so bad if the production was not so dirty and pale. There has not been a good photo here for years. At present, the image of the NU is being demanded here because of the very questionable purchase of our national film production center called Boyana Films. There is no doubt that there has been corruption, there has been cheating, there have been lies in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
