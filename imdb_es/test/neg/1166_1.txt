When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers considered it opportune to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, despite the fact that the resulting film was quite close to the facts of the notorious case. I guess it was fictionalized enough to make them think they should change their names and things like that. <br /> <br /> "Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield" disguises itself as a true story that tells the story of Gein, but in reality it looks very little like history. A biopic type movie is a farce. If ever a movie needed to change names, this is much more than "Deranged". It is as close to the true story of the crime as it was "Dirty Harry" to the true story of the zodiac murders. <br /> <br /> Okay, then, that annoyance aside, how is a horror movie? Well, like a horror movie, well, as a movie in general, it's pretty scary. One of the worst movies I've seen in months. The problems are solved in the following way: 1) Kane Hodder is, surprisingly, as miserable as Ed Gein. Absolutely inappropriate in the part, Hodder simply advances heavily with threatening expression. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the cast are rather "amateur dramatists" and completely uncommitted. It is painful to see how some lines are delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional efforts of making films with style seem to come from the "Clich√© of the great cinematography of The Moody Book". You've seen everything before, better executed. Apart from the effort for style, the rest of the film is largely inept: the cameras tremble, the framing is bad, there are too long senseless shots that slow down the rhythm ... which brings me to ... <br /> <br /> 4) It seems to go on forever. It is less than 90 minutes long, but sitting through is a test. You would swear it lasted two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein almost seems secondary. Mainly, the film deals with the family affairs of a new deputy Sheriff. Said deputy is interpreted by an abysmal actor on whose shoulders no film should rest. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about it? Well, the gore FX are very good. Some convincing wounds are shown and the makeup is generally excellent. However, none of this compensates for the massive failures of the film. <br /> <br /> It does not even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not pleasantly bad, it's not "so bad is good", it's just really bad. A film to avoid and despise.
