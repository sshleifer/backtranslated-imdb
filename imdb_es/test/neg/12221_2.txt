I did not care much about this, it seemed too artificial for a documentary. In addition, the filmmakers seemed to guide me towards certain characters and, however, I did not feel sympathy for the protagonist for what they decided to show me about him. <br /> <br /> This movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, however, the film failed due to an agile edition that did not allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. Developments in history were overlooked instead of showing men in boxers or other things that were secondary to the story they told. up in this story.
