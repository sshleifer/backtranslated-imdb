This must be one of the worst movies of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. A strange musical comedy that fails in almost all aspects. The silly plot has SINATRA trying to maintain the reputation of his father as BANDITA BESANTE. He is not a bandit and he does not kiss! Play the "nerd" character as well as you might expect given the dialogue you have to talk about. Scene thieves are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they did not have more scenes together. I have given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON "Love is Where You Find It" is sensational. I could have had a repeat of that one. Also, a dance number of a comic type by RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER if it's fun. Then, for those reasons and only for those reasons, it is observable. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's early years collection.
