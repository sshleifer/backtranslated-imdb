The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and even worse is the pain that is inflicted on the spectators of this production. Almost nothing was fun. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of 'comics' on the road as they traveled from city to city to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off stage and on stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally ungraceful. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand the self-deception of greatness that the prominent "comedians" possess, but it is more difficult to capture the sounds of laughter heard in their audiences. Therefore, these are the same audiences to which the comedies on television are destined. <br /> <br /> This was possibly the worst movie I've seen in my more than 50 years of movies.
