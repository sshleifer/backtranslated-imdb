This movie gives a cinematic example of the word without value. It's horrible, you can forget the plot or the decent performance, because it's not there. And with the rejection of any decent story or performance or even the trait of being a little scary, there's usually only one more left for a horror movie. The attraction for those who like soft core porn. This movie does not even have that. Women show a little skin, but really no more than say Xena's show. Except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor, and I mean bad sex scenes. So in summary, if you like good movies, you have no interest in this movie, if you like cheese you still have no reason to rent this movie, if you like erotic and soft core porn you have no reason to rent this movie. And, most importantly, if you value your time in the least, you can not do anything better than avoid this movie.
