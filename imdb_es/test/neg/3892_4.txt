DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics flattered this movie. I've seen it and I still do not understand it. The plot is thin, very thin. After the film ended, he still did not know the name of the female main character and one of the two male characters did not even have a name on the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". I did not care about the characters, so I did not care about the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery and the cinematography were brilliant, but so is the material from National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
