I just saw the Heaven's Gate. After seeing this epic western of 3 h 40 min that is not a western, I read Steven Bach's book. After considering all the events and the movie itself, I still think that this movie is a complete waste of time. I think that when someone tells you to look at them, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. If, for some reason, you can enjoy this indulgent and malicious film for yourself, I have to ask you why. Although this is not a reason to hate it, historically it is far away. It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply, the barrels of cattle of the time wanted to kill all the cattle thieves and claimed that they were all immature. You find that you just do not care about these people and you expect them all to die because at least then, something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things that happen, and they never show. After you sit down despite this huge waste of time, you wonder how someone could do a 4 hour epic in which nothing happens. Oh, and by the way, the Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County War, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in fact, 2 people died. I can not warn you enough about this movie. However, if you're like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that ruined the races and putting United Artists on the "for sale" lot, sounds like an interesting case to study; Film without sub-text, and a lot of photography (which is sometimes charming)
