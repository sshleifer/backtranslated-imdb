So, my friend and I are bothering at our local movie rental store and we are looking for something to learn with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not collect the third part of the Scarecrow series ?! Keep in mind that this is not just the Scarecrow Three; That is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we had both seen the first two Scarecrows, so we felt compelled to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we noticed a picture of Ken Shamrock ("The most dangerous man in the world") on the cover. Apparently, he was used to marketing the film as the "main actor". By the way, it has the shortest screen time of any member of the accredited class. Next we noticed a picture of a very attractive woman with little clothes in the middle of the cover. I can assure you that she is not in the movie ... at all. At the time of the rental, we assumed that this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was "going crazy". In the background we noticed a great carnival on an island in the ocean. I can also assure you that the carnival is not in the movie either ... at all. Looking back, my friend and I should have known something was happening. I mean really, who the hell puts a carnival on an island? Now to the real movie. We begin when a young man is inexplicably fused with a scarecrow in the middle of a field of corn. Do not ask me how they merged, but think about when Brandon Lee is waking up from the dead in The Crow. It's just stupid. But in the defense of the scarecrow, he has "gone mad". Anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives indirectly through the young man, travels to his local beach to mistreat those who did it wrong. Because yes, in the world of The Scarecrow, the beaches are conveniently located in the same general vicinity as the cornfields. To shorten the story, the scarecrow kills everyone who gets in his way without warning, except the whistle characteristic of the scarecrow that signals a cut. However, this is quite impossible to believe because the mouth of the scarecrow suit is clearly closed by the seam. Several follow-up shots that would cause Kubrick to collapse in his grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is tremendously bad."
