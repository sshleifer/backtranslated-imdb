The only reason I saw this movie was because I had Giovanni Ribisi and it was supposed to be "Horror". Do not be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" movie I've seen. It is about these people who go to a secret place that has a "Monster". The monster is a man with a deformed face running in blue pants that has a brain craving. Some people die, other people do not. In the end, they throw the monster of an airplane and then they fly away happy. BUT OH NO! THE MONSTER IS ALIVE AFTER LEAVING AN AIRCRAFT! Spend 2 hours in some other way, like seeing the painting on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this shit.
