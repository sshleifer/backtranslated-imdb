It's hard to decide if this movie suffers from a crappy dialogue or if it's made for the shitty actors to do it. In any case, it suffers from a writing of scripts that, in the best of cases, is mediocre. <br /> <br /> Although it was made at the end of the 80s, the first part of the film is presented as a teenage comedy of the 60s (except for the absence of real humor), especially the part of the 'good girl', which is a Doris Day figure as annoying as she might expect / fear, including complaining opposition to whatever "fun" her friends want to do. The net effect is that, after a while, you start to expect her to bite you so you do not have to listen to her voice anymore. <br /> <br /> Some blasphemy and gratuitous nudity, in addition to really 80 style clothes. It's your only clue that this movie was made in the 80s. Oh, and a bit of pretty passable music, too. <br /> <br /> Storywise, they are pretty much formulated things. A group of horny teens (apart, of course, from "miss miss nice girl") decide to celebrate Halloween night by organizing a party in a haunted house. The party and the fornication take place, along with an undesirable 'session' that initiates the wave of demonic possession that is the theme of the film. After this, the only suspense part will try to guess in which order the characters will expire. Surely you will not mind if they will or will not. The actors are so bad that becoming demons / zombies / dinners actually improves their performance a bit, and the ridiculously clich√©d dialogue is so annoying that you twist in your seat. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this movie is not special nonsense, unless you think cheese is something "special". For example, the demon head that appears occasionally is so falsely screaming that you wonder if it's a 5-year trick or treat. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is nothing nice in the movie. Some of the music is not bad, and the first of our insipid Scooby gang to be possessed performs a wonderful and really sexy dance routine in a moment, before it becomes unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Also, and I do not know why, towards the end of the film, I managed to get involved a bit. The suspense that was missing in most of the film made a late appearance, and I began to writhe in discomfort instead of discomfort. What is a horror movie supposed to do? <br /> <br /> Conceivably, I dare not give this film a background rating, since by an inexplicable miracle (I do not rule out being possessed by demons) I was actually a little scared. <br /> <br /> Do not pay money to see it, however. It's not worth your time, but only cash. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.
