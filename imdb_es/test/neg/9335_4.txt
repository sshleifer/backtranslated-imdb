It was not until I looked at the question section that I discovered that the original producer / protagonist of this movie, Tyrone Power, died during its creation. Undoubtedly, this explains why everyone on the screen seems to have their minds on other things, whose symptom appears in a very early scene that involves a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored? Well, that's the kind of expression that fighters have on their faces when they're swinging their swords in an unconvincing way. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Soloman, the king of Israel who has an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and His people are not happy about that. You can not really blame them, since there are few more beautiful things in the world than those Israeli motorists, although Israeli women seem all like Cherie Blair! Modern Israel is also very cosmopolitan, since the majority of Israelis were born outside the country, but this would have been the case a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks with a European and American accent. <br /> <br /> After a lot of talking and dancing sequence that must be seen to be believed (and not that it is not a compliment) we have a climax where Israelis heavily outnumbered have to defend themselves against a massive Egyptian army that You can not read a map otherwise you would have known that there was a cannon in front of them. This is what I do not understand. Although they are blinded by the sun, the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging against the Israelis and never realize they are charging towards a huge ravine! Is not this something illogical? It is also a revealing mistake since the horses, the cars and the men that fall into the canyon are obviously miniature figures. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film ends with Soloman killing his traitor brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you have an idiotic foe who can not see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword as if he were painting a wall?
