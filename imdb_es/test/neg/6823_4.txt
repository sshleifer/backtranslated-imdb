This is a pretty good family movement that I'm sure most children will enjoy, but there really is not much to please the adults who watch the movie. The premise of the film is that the Belushi police character retires but is involved in a case that makes him a private investigator. The plot of the film is so obvious that most children will surely choose the ending before it happens. But besides that, it seems that there are arcs of history and secondary arguments that are forgotten as the film progresses. This, along with a secondary plot in which the holder K-9 is eliminated by Belushi. One that you have to avoid is scary.
