Ugh, bad, bad, but I've seen worse, that's why I gave him a 2 instead of a 1. I just finished watching this movie and I thought it was as rotten as Dr. Chopper's flesh. The worst line of the film had to be "I like to introduce you to someone ... know my inner b * tch", which consisted of the only survivor of the fantastic group of 5 throwing a trash can at Dr. Chopper and then falling on the. stage. Second line worse, "I am the ranger who is going to fuck you" What, this monster is not even a policeman? Did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies by the magic stab (no one dies so fast by stabbing, I know because I see them often in the operating room) except the super ranger? The guy had like a bucket of poor blood from that wound, he twists a little on the floor, and then he goes in for the end to take a goodbye shot to Dr. Chopper while the inside is hidden on the floor. And if that does not surpass everything, he does not even have the decency to die, like everyone else. The inner b * tch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help because he is like his only friend who is now alive. Since when did these two become friends? I do not think a frantic meeting in the forest where he tells you to go to the city qualifies as to know your time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you do not have anything else and you have nothing else to do with your time.
