I'm sorry to say that this movie was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Following one of the biggest disappointments in the history of movie monster clashes, you would think they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the movie could be better silent, and the action was devised and away from the brightness of the heart of each original monster movie . The best part of AVP-Requiem is, in fact, the trailer, which as you go through the film, we realize that almost all the deaths and all the really cool shots of the movie were already shown in the trailer, that leaves little to reveal and little to be excited by I gave the movie an extra star for letting the sexiest woman who was almost naked see. The film was developed as a festival of color science fiction monsters by number that also played with the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you had already seen it a thousand times. The main flaw of these two films is that the creators thought that establishing the films in our time would make us more interested in the story as if it could happen to us one day. but what attracted people when they launched the arcade game in the past was that it took place within a futuristic upper version of the ALIEN trilogy timeline that allowed more than one suspension of disbelief. This is where future films need to be inspired. because to be honest, to see a waitress killed by an ALIEN that we have all feared since childhood does not really do it for us. We are going to take the series to its roots. learn from the old masters and do not get involved with a winning formula when trying to create a "new and bold vision". We liked the originals for a reason, we want to see that again. Finally, the ending is the real WTF moment of the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the great climax, the survivors are ambushed by Special Operations soldiers who justify their horrible actions by saying "we follow the orders" and then we become a penny. And everything starts to work well and they become saviors. then, after the long retreat, with one of the survivors looking sinisterly at the sky, we went to the strangest swing I've ever seen, with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) and then with all The subtlety of a blow to the face reveals that there will be another film with the hint of a plot line that would make an original sci-fi channel blush and be exposed. So, in short, if you have to choose between this movie and do any other activity on the face of the Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.
