Maybe this movie was really meant to be a satire like 'Airplane', but it failed as sadly as it failed to be a 'thriller'. I do not understand why they could not have paid a real pilot about two hundred dollars for a little technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical airplane managed to transform from 757 to 767 to 747 in one hour and the power levers worked backwards. And the dialogue seems to have come out of the back of a game of "phones" for children where everyone spoke different languages. Actually, I rewound the TIVO and saw it a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought at first. Was.
