Another pretentious film by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" shone from it, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of themes (a hot brunette with a dagger in the average, poor man driven to madness due to passion, gangs of Sierra Nevada, "bullfighters", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but about her talent there are more doubts, and Sbaraglia The paper is so stupid that it's almost incredible. The script is weak and the presumptuous character of Aranda influences the entire film. With these ingredients, the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
