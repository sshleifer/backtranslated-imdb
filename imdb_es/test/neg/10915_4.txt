Do not get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie about everything. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspense. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid Saint Bernard, I began to wonder why she did not do anything to help herself. <br /> <br /> She could have taken her foot out of the door and pushed the car back (that is, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill slope) and roll to a safe place, but then it would have been a very short movie. When he started the car, did he put it in reverse and hoped that at least he could get to the end of the road? No, she tries to make a three-point turn in a car with a bad alternator. He managed to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds at a time to try to get to a baseball bat that was on the ground nearby, what a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog. But, forget about the bat. There were no tools in the car, like an iron tire or something? I did not see her looking at the spare tire of the car. Really, why wait until I bite you and you weaken from dehydration and your child has convulsions before you stand up against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, she was hit and ripped, but by God she still wore high heels!
