Closet Land is an unpleasant job with excellent actors. Nothing else (or less) happens in the film, besides the endless abuse of an attractive prisoner by a sadistic police officer. The stage is minimalist. This could be considered soft core S & M pornography because the drama lacks all the reference points, such as time, place and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a futuristic fantasy environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified as a warning about the evils of the totalitarian government, but since there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we are disturbed but we have not learned anything. <br /> <br /> What is it? point? What torture exists in the world? That mistreating the prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land has echoes of works like Darkness At Noon and Rhinoceros by Ionesco, but both works were created by competent artists whose work had a historical context and a depth of meaning. This work is amateur and sophomoric dialogue. A defined downward thumb.
