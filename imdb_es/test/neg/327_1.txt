When you watch low-budget horror movies as much as I do, you get to where you can find out who participated in the creation of the film, since each filmmaker adds his own flavor to the cheese. Such is the case with Jack-O. When I saw this really horrible movie, I was left with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director but somehow, and while investigating, I discovered that he was right. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something so pathetic, and this movie just reeked of Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why someone) he would avoid this movie. If you're going to rent a photo of Olen Ray, rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, it's the only bright star in Olen Ray's dark universe of terrible movies.
