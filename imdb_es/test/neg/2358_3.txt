If I had not had any expectation of this movie, I could have received a 5 or a 6. In its current form, I give it a 3. The performance is poor, the objective precision of the drugs of which it speaks is lacking, and I do not feel empathy some for the characters. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Adam & Paul' immediately before watching this movie, and both laughed and cried several times. This movie did not hit even a similar chord. The directors of 'Human Traffic' may have some strange experience about ecstasy, but here there is no demonstration of real semantic knowledge related to drugs. In fact, I find it quite offensive and counterproductive to the struggle to make current drug laws less politically oriented. <br /> <br /> Watch 'Requiem for a Dream' if you're looking for a surprising and moving film. about drugs.
