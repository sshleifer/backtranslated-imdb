Apparently, the writer and director of this DVD direct slasher movie is a fan of Friday the 13th and other slashers of summer camps. This movie has it all: a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", the old man who warns them not to go there. and, of course, the crazy killer with the machete that keeps attacking and cutting the teenagers for no reason ... Everything could have worked if it had been filmed in a 35 mm film with acceptable special effects. But instead the special effects are badly made. The killer walks around like he's going for a walk on Sunday afternoons, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented leading actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Apart from that, boring and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan
