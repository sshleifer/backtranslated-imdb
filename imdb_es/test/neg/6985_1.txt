First, the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a lake in New Zealand, inside a downed plane of the Second World War is a great opening. What follows is nothing more than cartoons like nonsense. The men who chase the men, the cars that chase the men, the helicopters that chase the men, the helicopters that chase the boats, the boats that chase the boats, for most of an hour, the most stupid boring, without any advance in history. Special mention should be made to the store's edition, as many scenes seem to have spliced ​​in random order. The performance of all concerned is a shame. One last thing, the image quality and sound quality are so bad in this DVD that you will be horrified. - MERK
