I'm sorry, but this movie is too shallow for me. In it, PÃ©rez is a taxi dancer with her boyfriend Keitel who tries to become an actress. First of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? Even after sitting through this, I still do not know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a puppy in love. There is no reason behind love, it just happens. There are times when the characters and events really try to pull your strings, but it rarely works. The only character you really feel something about is Keitel, and that's just because he does a good job with him. Any other actor and character would have been like the others. <br /> <br /> The script is basically a review without inspiration on how difficult it is to do as an actor / actress. It has been done and said before, the language and dialogue seem to have been written by a street pimp. The ending is ... well, I do not want to spoil it. Let's say you feel unsatisfactory. I would be more upset if the story was good to start with. The direction is normal, with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch. To reiterate the performance, the only one who does something worth seeing is Keitel. Although I could have lived without seeing him in bikini underwear with tiger print. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, Eddie Bunker appears. However random that mention may be, it's that random in the movie. And Tarantino does his director a favor, introducing himself for about 20 seconds.
