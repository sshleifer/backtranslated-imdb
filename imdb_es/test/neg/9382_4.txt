It starts pretty well, but after a while you start to expect more from this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes confusing and it is not clear. The Czech filmmakers were good 20 years ago or more. But after they were transferred to a capitalist country, here it is, the unofficial but well-known Czech mentality ... COPY ... COPY ... COPY of everything they consider good, when they see it in other movies or countries or somewhere else. I think this is a good example of doing "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. And I'm left with "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest", which can not be compared to this movie in the form of ART and ACTORS and HISTORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. It could be done better. At least, they tried. I'm sorry guys. :-( CAN NOT recommend
