The first question is: how many idiots without talent are needed to ruin a movie? Answer: one is more than enough, if you write the script and direct it. The second question is: Did someone teach the actors how to handle weapons properly? Answer: hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit in the face with hot brass, because I thought so! The third question is: how many times did we make the plot "the super secret conspiracy of the government agency is discovered from within"? Answer: a good couple too many! The fourth question is: Are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overrated? Answer: in this movie, sadly, yes. The fifth question is: can a pair of tits save this movie? Answer: Even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and the director / writer) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see the killer (probably) preparing his weapons for a hit, and then the assholes in the prop department give him a completely different set, the first bloody thing in the damn movie , the "suction" meter reaches the top. Time from the beginning of the movie until I turned off the television: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than what it cost me in case of "Alone in the Dark".
