I do not dislike Cary Grant, but I have found that his performances are annoying enough to notice; this, Arsenic & Old Lace and Bringing up Baby. I do not dislike North by Northwest, but the movie seems unbearably silly. Besides that, it seems to me that the endless conversation about Grant's class is boring. I have no idea what your class does for the viewers who announce it. He does not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> In the behind-the-scenes feature included with this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says that Grant was his father's favorite protagonist; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better protagonist in a series of best films of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> With the ending ruined, this is really half of a movie and does not support discussion, and it can not stand the high ratings it is getting. Even if the film had its end intact, there is not much for that. Fontaine is a completely nasty sucker. She has to remain numb, inactive and unwilling to contact anyone, except Johnny, for the full movie, at either end, for her tricks to work. That is not much to work with. Cary Grant starts each line with "Monkeyface ..." until I wanted to strangle him. He says it about sixty times. It is positively grid. Hitch's technique here is surprisingly superficial. An endless succession of rooms / sets has a false skylight projected on the back wall as a cobweb effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can make fans excited, but it can not keep a film so poorly made. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should step down if he does a further imitation of Hitchcock / Cary Grant on a DVD. I think that's his whole career now. As soon as I saw it, I thought, oh shit, here comes an imitation that only he is impressed. In its place there were two! Oh, Joy!
