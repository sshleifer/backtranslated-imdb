It's as if the editor and the scriptwriter only had 40 minutes of actual execution time. This is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese movie, which obviously is far superior to this garbage. It is clear that some writers or a brainless Hollywood suit decided that this film would be hand in hand, man against man, instead of letting the story unfold with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes. At this point in the film, the characters simply do not act like normal people and not even as their own personalities. It makes little sense. It's pretty clear why this movie failed. It's just not believable at all and that's very bad, it started with a promise. Do not be fooled
