Sylvester, the cat stowaway in a boat in which the Tweety bird passes with his grandmother who owns it. Oh, I do not even have enough words to express how much I despise the two characters of Tweety and Granny. They just are not funny to me and made this short a task to sit well with. Sylvester is a great character by himself, but there's only so much he can do when faced with the terrible cruelty of that damn candidacy and the old senile granny witch. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Dorada Collection, Volume 1 and has an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
