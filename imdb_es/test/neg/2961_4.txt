I've seen Shallow Grave for years, and that was one of those movies that I kept in my memory for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with many sudden turns. But all this made sense. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same about dead bodies. On the title there is a subtitle that says it is "even better than Shallow Grave". This is a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies loses strength and becomes much less convincing during the movie. <br /> <br /> Two secondary characters, for example, turn out to be much less innocent than they appeared to be. That might work as a surprise, but it did not surprise me. I could see it in the previous minutes, and * that * is a big difference with Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I have to mention is that the characters in this movie often respond not very realistic. They behave this way more often when the movie comes to an end. <br /> <br /> It would have seemed much more interesting if some of the characters had remained completely innocent, without knowing what is happening. It would have been better for the contrast, for example, with Tommy and his friend, who have to keep a big secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason, the creators of this movie decided that all the characters should show their darker sides. It does not work in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The end felt like an open ending. It left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I expected much more. <br /> <br /> At first I would have given this film six stars because it is not all bad. I liked seeing it. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> But occasionally I saw some really poor performances and unrealistic scenes and, due to the disappointing open end, I'm left with four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake that my time and my money have been dedicated to him. Unlike Shallow Grave, it is likely that I will forget Dead Bodies very soon. It just is not such a special movie. <br /> <br /> The creators could have done a much better job with this movie. It's a pity they have not done it.
