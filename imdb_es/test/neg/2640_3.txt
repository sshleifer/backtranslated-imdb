In a quiet town, a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends by a strange child named Milo, who lives on the other side of town. After the murder, his body is in a river and his dead pronounced. So sixteen years later, a wedding takes the girls to their childhood city and Claire, a school teacher, becomes obsessed that Milo has not died, as she has recurring visions of him and his friends are dying one for one and no one believes her when she affirms. Milo is apart from that. So now, she sets off to discover the horrible truth. <br /> <br /> When I found this movie, I was quite skeptical about it, especially when I had "From the creators of Anaconda" on the cover, but when I read the outline of the weird little plot on the back of the case of video, it sounded good and quite refreshing for a change. Well guess what? I thought it was a good idea at that time, but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the movie. It seemed that I was trying to be intelligent and very psychological, but that last element did not go so well and was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit he had his moments, but barely enough so that it is neither chilling nor memorable. But, a bravo to the filmmakers, at least the story is not a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed "Scream" and horror horror, is not there a self-referential humor evident? Actually there is not even a humor track. Although, maybe it was too serious? Especially, since the plot is quite absurd, but that is not his main problem. What a disconnected plot we got, I did not know much about what was happening, since it seems to evade many things in favor of some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. Do not! More like irrelevant scenes and yawns that induce clich√©s that we see from time to time. You can also see some influences from some "good" horror movies of the 70s, one of which is "Do not look now." This when our main character continues to see the figure of his past in a polished. The other would have to be one of my favorites "Alice, Sweet Alice" with the person who causes the problem of wearing a yellow raincoat and committing grisly deaths. Interesting idea, but it appears quite superficial and appear too many flaws. I liked it more when the scenes were about the character's childhood, since the performances and the circumstances had something of creepy, but when he enters his adulthood, he is tired and without incident for the most part and the performances were not horrible, but incredibly mundane and barely involved is a good way to say it. Most of the dialogue made me moan in disbelief at how clever and clumsy it was. You'll be screaming "no duh!" on the screen, because you can not believe what you're listening to. The police detective is the most affected! <br /> <br /> As for the quality: the film is not bad, it's actually better than your usual for the video, I would say. Very clever things. With some creative and prominent camera angles and a weak score that works reasonably well. Another factor that stood out and that was key to building on the atmosphere of bad mood was the sound effects that creep and that bicycle bell leaves a ringing sensation in their ears. The configuration of a quiet elementary school was well done and the rest of the action takes place in a house. But, just do not expect any real suspense or surprises since the execution of these does not exist. The deaths are not pleasant, they are a bit bloody and they are more the consequences of what happens to these bodies, which tries to bother them. The villain of this piece, the miserly boy Milo Jeeder, was a little disconcerting, well, to begin with, the voice and the yellow polisher leave a mark, but it seems to lose its effect when we come to the conclusion of the film. The lines of the cheesy label in the video compare it to (move over) Jason, (careful) Freddy and (this is not a child's play) Chucky, but you have to be kidding! Right? It is labeled "The new face of evil", yes clear. All you need is for them to teach you some manners and solve the problems. In general, the movie left me with a bitter taste, since I could have done it without having seen it. I probably wished I had done it. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much in this blurred image of a movie. Or, better yet, omit it, since, in reality, you will not miss much.
