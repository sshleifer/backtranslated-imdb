I received this movie in a package called "50 Star Films" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This was terrible. It was a truncated retread made 1000 times before and getting better. A crippled ex-jock dares to train a team formed by juvenile delinquents. They learn from him that they can do it if they follow the rules. I am sure that the children and the locals were delighted to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can not imagine what the people who launched and produced this project thought they could contribute to this already overcome issue. I kept hoping to see that 'new turn' or 'new angle' but, honestly, it does not come. Avoid this movie. Forget about the 45 cents, I want to recover the 96 minutes of my life.
