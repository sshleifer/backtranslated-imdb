When I borrowed this movie, I did not expect a high-quality performance, but this was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were so incredibly bad that you could not easily get into this movie if you tried. There's nothing like watching a child announce things like "Oh no, my dad is invisible!" or "I wonder what he does?" in the same monotone with which one could announce radio traffic announcements. There are some good actors, but they are wasted in smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, although it would be pretty easy to guess, considering that there are not too many real changes in the plot. Many holes, too. For example, the father is invisible, and the inventor realizes what part is needed to make it visible again. So the child goes and steals the part of an electronics store. Could not he just ask his dad for money? <br /> <br /> This appears in the Comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty silly, like the invisible dad who takes off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappears naked during a meeting, or walking with his head covered at all times. Fun at first, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because you can see it, and it's one of those movies that are fun in their own way ... like the recitation of monotonous lines.
