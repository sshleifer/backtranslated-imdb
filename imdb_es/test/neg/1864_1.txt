This is one of the worst movies that have been made. I can not believe how bad it was. I was surprised at how horrible the "ghoulies" masks are. They are OBVIOUSLY Halloween masks! The mouths do not even move when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and ridiculous? Every time they do something, it seems that there is a music similar to that of a circus and an excess of use of BONK and BOING when they hit people. The dominatrix slavery lady is one of the worst actresses I have seen in my life. This movie is just bad. The plot is non-existent. However, the mother of ONE TREE HILL is in this and, obviously, has had a nose job since it was done. Why the main character of the first movie came back to make this garbage? BAD BAD BAD movie.
