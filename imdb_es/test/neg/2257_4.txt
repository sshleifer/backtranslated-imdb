A VERY un-Tom and Jerry short film. Jerry tells this story that revolves around Tom, the cat that falls in love and loses it with his rival, Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friend here, which bothered me a little. The cartoon is also presented in cinemascope. In general, I found this caricature of Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. I should have put "Puss gets the boot" on the DVD and I would have liked it. This animated experimental short film can be found on Disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-Spotlight DVD collection collection. It's the last one on the set and I hope that Warner Brothers chooses to release a second Volume soon. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
