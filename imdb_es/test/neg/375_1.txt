This time, The Beastmaster (Marc Singer) only returns to face a new enemy, Arklon (Wings Hauser), but due to an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher), they are transported to the future, where they then face each other. Many jokes (lame) of water follow. Honestly, you do not have sequels so rotten to the core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie for the eyes. The references and "hipness" date the movie badly (this was done in 1991) and really, who wants to see The Beastmaster in the current times? Also worth noting is Wings Hauser, whose shameful performance is easily the best asset of the film. Singer looks uncomfortable, Wuher is irritating and all the jargon of 1991 simply makes the movie absolutely impossible to see. This is easily one of the worst movies that have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (horrible)
