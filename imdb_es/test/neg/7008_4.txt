The female cast of this movie is fantastic: you have Linda Blair (maturing very well), Julie Strain (who does not talk too much like crazy, that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (who is as convincing as a sweet and innocent girl ). as an evil girl), Toni Naples, and the most beautiful of them all, the IMO, the simply amazing Kristina Ducati (how the silly male leader, Larry Poindexter, deserved to be sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). However, beyond the possibility of seeing these beautiful women and, in some cases, talented women, the film has little to offer. The plot is disjointed and does not really start until the last 15 minutes or so; and when Wynorski finally manages to create something of suspense, an absurd "twist" ends and ruins everything.
