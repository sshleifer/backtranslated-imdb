This film is sometimes called 'The Story of O-Pt.2', which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of a kind) to the French erotic S & M thriller 'The Story of O'. Although I have never seen the original version, yes, however, I could see this unfortunate mix of sexual and social politics. I suppose that the angle 'O' comes from the occasional nuances of S & M (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to see) as those of 'Mistress.' Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French / Japanese production (but he speaks his lines in English (at least in the version I saw) The unnecessary use of surrealism only makes this a boring example in pseudo pornography even more pretentious (what are trying to prove with the representation of a piano floating in the water? It is obvious that after all the trend "porno chic" in the movies was exhausted (oh, I'm sorry!) Around 1975, the producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the film experts for adults, not to mention Foreign / Art Cinema, so filmgoers had to deal with dreck like 'The Last Woman', and others like this one.
