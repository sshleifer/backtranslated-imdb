The main premise of this film is the fantasy of all women: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well, at least it's a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight with a man. What is that, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry, it's not a bloody type of eating of men. It's more like a comedian drinking them, like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left behind. So for fans of blood, guts and gore, forget about this movie, there is not much gore here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters in the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a good guy who stalks Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is already a bit silly at the moment, but then they launch two equally silly sub-stories that simply send this movie to the bad one. Territory of the movie. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding a new love with a pair of twins together; and, finally, assassinate one of them and become a fugitive bank robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen finding a new love with a nice cop who rescued her from a bad date related to prostitution, and decided that she wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet again at the end of the movie in totally unbelievable circumstances, and magically Helen's murderous vagina heals!
