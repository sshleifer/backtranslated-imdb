I'm a big fan of Zack Allan and I was disappointed that he only had one scene in the movie. This was also my favorite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs it to Down. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace and River of Souls, most of the action took place outside the station. I did not care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and I think Sheridan is fine, but not Sinclair. I like Lochley but she only had a limited screen time. If you like crusades or space battles you should enjoy it. Personally I can only give 1/10.
