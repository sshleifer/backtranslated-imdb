A woman is caught in a rash of seemingly inexplicable suicides. On the other hand, are they really suicides? It seems that there is a loose ghost. Guess what? The ghost has a long black hair that hides his face, and moves with his head or arms twisted in this way, creating a very strange looking spectrum. The recurring theme music is reproduced from unexpected places to announce the arrival of the ghost, and the strange sound effects, which resemble the sound of small twigs that break, always accompany this unfortunate spirit. Does any of this sound familiar? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, you should. Taking a large loan and without qualms about "The Ring", "One Last Call" and some other recent horror hits, this film tries to bring an interesting and worn plot to a climax, but we've seen it all before. Avoid it unless you are desperate or have not seen any other Asian horror movie in the last 10 years.
