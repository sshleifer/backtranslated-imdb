Only in the world of Hollywood audiovisual fiction could anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything that interests them, answer phones, climb stairs, all in search of a demolition expert who wants to catch everyone. Oh yes, and then we have the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he is wearing a vest, and then he can fall down a long flight of stairs and still have the advantage over his stupid pursuers. All the clich√©s imaginable in the suspense movies were used. I only saw it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh, but yes, it's great to see how morally superior this FBI agent is, when he's pretty sure there's a bomb in an Opera and the alarm does not sound. Who writes these scripts ?????????????
