I have seen this program several times and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was contacted to do this due to the fact that she is Britney's sister and I am sorry to say that that in the program is obvious. They have created the character Zoey to be all that people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is, intelligent, original, intelligent, pretty, etc. that they, more loved by boys than them. There's nothing original about this and it's full of money, so every kid has the best fashions and stuff. I also have to say that, for a 13-year-old girl (or whatever, it can not be much older) she wears very mature clothes, those short skirts are too short, she makes young people want to wear them and that makeup, this adds to the growing problems of why young girls get into so many problems. All I'll say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given her age, she's not that bad at all, much better than her sister when it comes to vocal ability. I'm sorry, he's too mature and yet too stupid. It is wrong with predictable story lines and there are too many stereotypes.
