This has some of the most stupid fighting scenes of all time. If I were a veteran of any war, I would cry when I saw this movie, not because I remembered being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war. Although the troops carry M16, that movie does not look like Vietnam at all. Even the Viet Cong uniforms look like old Japanese uniforms left over from a World War II movie. The stage is, obviously, a bit of Hollywood shit back. The worst scene is that of an American soldier who fights "hand to hand" like in a bad martial arts movie. After sending several enemy troops, he says: "Come here and let's kick a butt!" to a helicopter in the air. Then he is shot. This movie is garbage.
