Let me first say that in the past, I've been a big fan of Carlin. I think George is one of the smartest and best comedians on the planet. what made Jorge so great in the past was his ability to see things in his twisted way, and give us his unique perspective on those things. he did not always intend to be funny, but he always respected his opinions, because they presented themselves in such an intelligent way. but all of you are sick is just a long tirade. He does not give us a unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of things he is working on. there is no vision, no intelligence, only an old man complaining for an hour directly about things that we have all complained about. And on top of that, it was not even funny. all of you are sick calls to foolish people who can not handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. I do not care about the anger that fuels the comedy, but George could have done much better. I really hope that the next George Carlin show is up to the quality George has shown in the past.
