I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this movie. If she was supposed to be depressed, I think the screenwriter and the director neglected the depressive research before making this film because Ricci's character was more a representation of a selfish and worthless person than a victim and survivor of depression . /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I could not buy it. This is straight to the schlock video. I'm glad I did not pay to see this.
