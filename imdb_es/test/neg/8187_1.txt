This is a truly horrible movie. The jokes are few and far between and the rhythm is a test of resistance down to the right. The only fun of this production is its comparison with the classic movie "This Is Spinal Tap". <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if it were one of the plagues of the Bible itself. <Br /> <br />
