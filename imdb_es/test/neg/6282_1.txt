SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> This is Tenchi? <br /> <br /> This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually everyone is written horribly out of place ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, evil is not punished for its actions, which amounts to a violation of mind control. If a male villain had done to one of the women what Haruna did to Tenchi, then (rightly) he would have painfully bought him at the end of the film, dying horribly, and the audience would have encouraged him. But not only does Haruna pay no price for her crimes, Ryoko really forgives and UNDERSTAND her actions. Do not! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated her because of what Haruna had done to her beloved Tenchi; The audience with whom I saw this, including myself, all booed audibly in this scene <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoid this movie. Fans of Tenchi, avoid this movie even more difficult.
