The film version of 'Rising Damp' came out two years after the television series ended. Like many fans, I went to the cinema when it opened. I left bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent much time writing the script; Most of it is annealed ideas of old episodes. At the time of the release of the film, the series 'Rising Damp' was still repeated regularly in I.T.V. so the audience was asked to pay to see something they had already seen. At least the films of 'On The Buses' had original scripts. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Richard Beckinsale had died the previous year, so they eliminated the character of 'Alan' as a mark of respect, replacing the art student 'John', played by Christopher Strauli of the fame 'Only When I Laugh'. It just was not the same. <br /> <br /> As another poster has pointed out, Rigsby's pension was nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and completely cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked at the original "Casino Royale", a film imbued with surreal humor. 'Rising Damp' also has its share of fantasy sequences 'Walter Mitty' style, as the parody 'Saturday Night Fever'. Personally, I found them horribly out of place. On the positive side, Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as ever the sordid 'Rigsby', like Frances De La Tour as 'Ruth' and Don. Warrington as' Philip. It is a pity that the film is not worthy of his talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was exhibited by I.T.V. as a tribute, with its final scene, which shows Rigsby prostrate prostrate at the foot of the stairs, eliminated in the interest of good taste.
