First of all, I would like to clarify that I voluntarily submit to the viewing of terrible movies. I have seen what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my mind, the films can not be worse than those of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The pirate movie, without any exaggeration, is the WORST WORLD MOVIE. Before watching the movie, I was informed that the movie was horrible, but I did not believe the accusations. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film. <br /> <br /> Start with a 3-minute clip from a pirate ship apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. "The End" splashes across the screen. Unfortunately, it is not the real ending of the movie. The film is about an awkward, awkwardly unpopular girl named Mabel, who carries a ghetto balaster with her and is attracted to ambiguous homosexual pirate boys. He drowns and has a hallucination too prolonged in which he plays a little zancita with little clothing that falls in love with Frederic, who has just left the ocean. Actually I could be homosexual. The Pirate King has a piece of code with rubies and diamonds. It sounds and squeaks when you squeeze it. <br /> <br /> There's singing in this movie. You may have the impression that this is a musical hilarious. It is not. Believe me. They are the worst songs you've heard, and at the end of the first original melody, you'll look for objects to pierce your eardrums. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other films in here. By references, of course, I mean "obvious scams." The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the lightsaber were, in fact, anti-hilarious. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is, at its best, painful to listen to. The direction is totally horrible, and in a moment you can see the acrobatics pad on the scene, which is not very well hidden. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Remove it completely and never think about it again. If you appreciate your mental capacity, then I beg you, NEVER LOOK AT THIS MOVIE.
