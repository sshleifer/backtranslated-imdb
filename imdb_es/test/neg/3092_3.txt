This movie should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but even he could not rescue the story of a young girl who seeks the truth about the death of her sister. Spoiler warning: Actually, the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and superficial girl who took too many drugs. It's not a big turn and it's not that interesting either. The movie is also overloaded with too many flashbacks and voice-overs and lacks dramatic rhythm. In short, it's worth losing, I do not recommend it.
