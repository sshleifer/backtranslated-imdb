An excellent cast that does everything possible with a horrible script, an inept direction and some of the worst scores I've ever heard. More television movies of the week than serious drama. What is sad when you consider that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that, instead of creating dramas and characters, it was better to show the most graphic and violent fragments and hope that the audience would be surprised by compassion and interest. In my opinion, one of the most obvious ways to adapt and paste the film.
