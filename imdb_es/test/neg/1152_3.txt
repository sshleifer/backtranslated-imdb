I had never heard of this movie until it came to DVD. Immediately I was intrigued by everything related to him: the actors, the title, the cover and, especially, the author. Arthur Miller, you can not go wrong with him, can you? Yes. I have not read the novel, but I suppose it was much better than the movie. I had high hopes for this movie. I love Macy and Dern, and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this film never rises above the precise messages about racism and intolerance. If you have never seen other films that deal with this topic, or if you never knew that the United States was founded on fanaticism, this movie may surprise you. Others will probably find it predictable, obsolete and, in general, insipid.
