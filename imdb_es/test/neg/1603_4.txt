Yes, there is a "sleeper" looking at Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading the comparisons with "24" (as on the cover of the DVD), I expected an accelerated action game. But no ... this series just keeps going. In my dazed half-awake state, I would think, "He's going to ..." and, poof, it would happen ... "I guess the truck is going to roll out ..." and there it goes. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn, in extra deep coverage, chase a baby? Could it be, perhaps, providing a bit of T & A? Hey, that works for me, therefore, four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I have seen "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not "24".
