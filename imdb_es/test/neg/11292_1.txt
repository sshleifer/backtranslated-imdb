The only reason why I did not fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal is boring> boring> boring and boring! This movie is just terrible, not because of violence or graphic mutilation. Actually, it is quite tame in that sense. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just called this one. The actors are fine, they just needed a little direction. The musical score is also very annoying. It is especially remarkable since so little is happening in the movie. It looks good, but that's not enough reason to see it. By the way, did I mention what BORING is? <br /> <br />
