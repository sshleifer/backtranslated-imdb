This movie is a theory I've had for quite some time: in Australia, if a movie deals with the right subject, it will be a success, regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not be worse: the acting is more than terrible, the plot is basically a bad imitation of the Warriors, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea of ​​the ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in the Sydney of the 21st century The last time an Irish gang was in Australia was about a hundred years ago, in the time of the problems!) But as it is about ethnic rivalry, one of the four themes that will surely be a success in Australian cinema (together with families in difficulty, minority groups, and the biography of a famous Australian) won multiple academic awards. I have always suspected that Australian critics will accumulate any rubbish that deals with these problems, but a part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. This movie proves otherwise. So, for all of you aspiring Australian filmmakers, do not bother thinking about your movie or choosing people who can act, or even get correct information. Just write a script about a poor family trying to make ends meet. or someone from a foreign race who comes to Australia and has to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or, if you want to get a leaf out of these people's books, some ethnic gang fight against another ethnic gang that is not really plausible in the The movie is ready, and your movie will win five Academy Awards regardless of how pathetic it is!
