"The Next Karate Kid" is a completely predictable movie, just like its predecessors. Their predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the part of the viewer, who often wants the story to move a little faster. Despite his moments of calm and extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively due to the presence of Morita. He does not seem tired of his role, and injects some life and humor into the movie, becoming the best reason for you to see it. It's not horrible, but not much.
