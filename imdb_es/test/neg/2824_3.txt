This thing takes the hot teen genre, very badly respected to begin with, and throws it completely into the toilet. The only people I would even consider recommending are teenagers, for a "revealing" scene in the children's locker room. And in the end I would not make such a recommendation. Doing so would contribute to the delinquency of a minor. An absolute piece of garbage without any redeeming quality.
