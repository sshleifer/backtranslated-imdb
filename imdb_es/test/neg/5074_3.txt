How? I wondered why I had not seen this in the theaters, not even in a single commercial, and then, after watching the movie, I realized that I had been tricked with HARDCORE. I'm a big fan of Transporter, and a big fan of Blade, so when I saw this I imagined a scene of a murderous fight between two rudos, many weapon games, a lot of things. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a short cameo of Statham and Snipes. The guy who makes the audio and the video in the crime lab has more time in front of the screen than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie waiting for a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad Hollywood movies, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better.
