Man, oh man, this was a piece of dog sh # t. I read some comments here after seeing the case in the local video store, and I thought ........ Ah, this looks like a decent half movie. Vampires Words. Thailand.How can you be wrong? Right? No, no, there's no way that f * cking wrong. Jesus, if only I could get my eyes out and not remember this movie, I would be happy. The main actor had the happiest and happiest voice of all time. Man! It really was bad ... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ..." F * ck off! My friend and I changed the audio track on the DVD to Portuguese just so we did not have to listen to the boy's voice. Subtitles and everything ... and this IMPROVED the movie. I mean it, if you think something like me and I wonder how was this movie ... STOP MARKING. I have the answer The worst movie of all time! There is no good action, there is no good blood and only a little nudity. Just pure sh * t for 90 minutes. Do not rent this, buy it, think about it or see it at 3:00 a.m. Just do not cut the cake ... not at all ... in any way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You would have a better time. I'm sure.
