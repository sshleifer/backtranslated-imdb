Where should I start with this movie? All I know is that it is a disaster. Be the script, the story, or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing on the part of Salman Khan, who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this. Secondly, Rani is getting really upset, appearing in all the stupid movies since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (I'm glad Saathiya has stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but it ruins the fun movie. The dialogues are missing. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? DO NOT!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the films mentioned above, but here he is crazy. Your character is misspelled. One minute is poor and the next you wonder how poor it is. Rani Mukherjee looks like a simple jain and was not putting any effort. Fortunately he redeemed his career with Saathiya because his career was going crazy at this time. Pooja Batra put a bit of charm here with her appearance, but still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. The beauty and performance of Kashmira Shah have escaped her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful, but puts little performance. Mohnish Behl receives the award for the worst actor (support) (they need Razzie because there have been terrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks strange and is not in his usual way. Just to tell you, there are more to the cast that are also terrible. If it were not for the stunning beauty of Raveena in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give a point to the movie. Otherwise Salman's dancing was terrible. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I would like the costumes to be remodeled and the rest of the cast (and her monkey dance) to have been swept away by the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya, which does not have a good enough image. The same goes for the decent half-title song. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.
