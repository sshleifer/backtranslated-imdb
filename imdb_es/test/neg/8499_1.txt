I would not have given this film such a low rating (2) if its average had not been ridiculously high, but someone had to reduce it to something more reasonable. I sat for most of this movie, watching scene after scene of tagging and theft. No dialogue, just tagging and theft. Finally the two taggers kissed. Something happened. But then we tag and steal again. I left the projection. I recommend this movie only to those who are impressed by the pretentious film making. I did not like the directors of the previous film (a fair defense of love between men and boys), but at least that movie had a story, interesting characters, dialogues. The Graffiti Artist only had scene after scene of labeling and theft. I want more than one movie than this.
