This movie is not so good at all. It's pretty stupid, quite annoying and very badly done. I really only saw this movie because one of my friends said that they hated this movie. Although I did not hate it as much as they did. , I still thought it was a pretty bad movie. The only thing remotely good about this was that it was sometimes a little entertaining, and I also think that if it had been done a little better, it would have been fine too. What I want to say a little better is that if it had been totally recast, it would not have looked as if it had been filmed for a film festival, and if the script had been improved, it would have been a good movie. It is not, but rather what it is now, a fucking movie. The acting is atrocious. I felt like I was watching a couple of teenagers act like a Halloween show or a suspense trip or something. The murders are quite cheap (as is the movie itself), and basically everything else is low class. In general, this movie is really bad and you would not miss it. in anything if you decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
