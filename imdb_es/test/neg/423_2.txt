I think I probably would not hate this movie if I spoke Polish. I selected the English version in the first menu, but it gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, just like the Polish version did. Perhaps the dialogue was so disconnected because the person who did the subtitles could not translate it into English very well. To exacerbate the problem, some of the dialogues did not have subtitles at all. The acting was pretty bad, especially the female lead, which was melodramatic in everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and when the mafia pushed her, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her bare chest for the next 15-20 seconds. I could not see how his chest added to the drama of the scene or the movie. Maybe the director was trying to increase the number of male teenagers in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp released by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms did not look anything like the uniforms of the United States Army. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland was liberated by the Americans. I would think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that the Russians liberated the six extermination camps. In short, it is not a very good movie if you do not speak Polish.
