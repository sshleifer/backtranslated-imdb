Nothing could be more attractive than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The fresh and refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American man. What could be more beautiful? Well, this is not that movie. Immediately, they ruin him by choosing Kristin Scott Thomas as a US congressman. That's like choosing Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you can not imagine holding hands with ex-fat addicts in dirty neighborhoods, or squeezing stinking crowds and kissing babies. She would have been much better chosen as the English-born widow of an aristocratic senator, the kind who belongs to the hunting club and attends floral shows, but has no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there's Harrison Ford as a normal police man. It is certainly strong enough for the role. But the idea that you will fall in love with this impressive beauty of the high society is a bit difficult to swallow. Why could not he have been, say, a reformer politician, hard but rich, with working-class roots who inherits the seat of Kristin's Senate? Initially, the two are very good with each other, but for the love of their mother, Kristin gives a cordial greeting and he, in return, begins to show him the crudest side of life: the things of which his husband had taken refuge. His political awakening coincides with the passion of a newer, more worker lover, who appreciates his refinement and refinement much more than his aristocratic husband. That is a love story! However, instead, you get a blank and meaningless "thriller" where the action is prolonged and nothing happens. Well, there's a "drive by" ghetto style in the scene where Harrison almost dies, but it's so abrupt and inexplicable that it really looks more like comic relief. <br /> <br /> The sky is always gray in this movie, and Our refined and lovely Kristin always looks a little cold. When you're supposed to be dreaming about passion, it's more like you're dreaming of a woolen blanket and a cup of tea! He also seems to have a bit of sleep most of the time, as if he would really rather nap on the bed rather than sleep with Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> After all, I'd say you can not blame her.
