Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his films talk about each other, because, he says, people do that in life. Well, people also cough, burp, shoot on tangents, etc. The point is that the fact that people really do something does not make it a convincing movie. That is a subject. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that this is not a very intelligent or direct or important satire, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks that all but a small core of officials Elect Republicans is a liberal hippie style of the 60s. I mean the guy still trots Zonker on his strip, a character that is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him as if he were a representative of a large swath of young Americans. . <br /> <br /> I was wrong. I am conservative, but I am not saying that this is bad because it has a liberal inclination. I could take a liberal course and be fun and relevant, but it is not. It is primarily a piece of boudoir with a group of prominent liberals (including the obnoxious and repellent Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes he feels unscripted, and the rest of the time he has a sarcastic air of personal importance and "are not we so smart?" - ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said that this program insists that you have a cult following. I believe that their cult status is more desired than real. I'm sure there are two or three people out there who recorded all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard, then every show that is broadcast is a cult classic to some extent. If Tanner did not have the names of Altman and Trudeau attached, it would be another HBO production forgotten from the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as an incisive and powerful political commentary by the players at the top of their game. . Reality, however, is as far from that as possible. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner was, and has been dead for a decade.
