If it's considered as an independent feature, I can not say it's that bad at all, but from where I'm standing this sequel and the original "Lady and the Tramp" do not agree with each other! They are two completely different movies with different styles, different voice personalities, different narratives and almost the only thing they share are the images (for example, the house of Jim Dear, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of them. they've changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some kind of continuity after the release of the original for those memorable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you any at all! Almost all the songs have a bit of pop and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and their aunt Sarah and their cats can be seen, but it seems that they are somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention Peg It does not appear at all, whose voices are quite annoying. Even Lady and Tramp do not appear often enough and as for Scamp? He is so spoiled! And he treats his father Tramp with a total lack of respect, then flees without remorse, even after hearing how much they miss him at home. And they called their cheeky escapade an adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf really brought out the evil bad guy from Scamp by eliminating the typical Disney animal. Even the old characters just drive you crazy in this; Trusty sounds like sick Goofy in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - they do not sound Scottish nor worthy of being heard! Move away as far as possible to free our poor ears from your voice and as for the fools, with feathers, JUNKYARD DOGS EXASPERING !!!!!! Someone has lowered them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "The Lady and the Tramp 2" is not all bad if you're still not having a difficult day, but I expect much more charm from a sequel to a true classic: Scamp is chavvy, so is it his girlfriend Angel and her story is weak. Still, I think you should try at least once because, as I say, there are much worse movies.
