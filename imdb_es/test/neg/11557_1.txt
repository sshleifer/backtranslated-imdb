I think I can say for sure (without really giving anything) that this movie did not have robots. The types of "robot" costumes did not act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" is not a robot either. <br /> <br /> Everything looks like a city park was filmed somewhere, with photos in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can not even use words to describe the performance ... <br /> <br /> This could not even offer the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it is clearly one of the worst science fiction movies of the 80s and I would say "of all times".
