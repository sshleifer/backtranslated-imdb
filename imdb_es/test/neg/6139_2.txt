************* SPOILERS DOWN ************** "'Night, Mother" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who he calmly announces to his shameless mother (Anne Bancroft) that he is going to commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that lacks all vitality and emotion. The bright hook turns out to be a trap, the story that follows lacks substance, gravity and revealing value. Where are the shocks and surprises that mother and daughter have in the last conversation of their lives? Where are secrets, confessions, fantasies and regrets revealed? They are here, but all have been painted the same opaque color that maintains the background emotion and celebrates the "genius" of the playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a movie, but a test of grueling endurance. <br /> <br /> Let me start with my comments by saying that I consider Sissy Spacek to be one of the best actresses in film history, such a magnetic woman. so natural that she continues to surprise and surprise me after twenty years of stardom. Brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and her sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I saw this movie in the first place, and for one of its films to be terrible, it has to fail in a significant way. This movie fails in two. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the film is so faithfully adapted to the Pulitzer winning play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole movie is a dialogue between two women between Jesse and her mother. What worked on the stage: a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small houses about the film. A work, no matter how big, needs to be * adapted * for the screen? It is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that you can not alter a word. The script of this movie could have been shortened from thirty to forty pages, and a wise screenwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and the competent Bancroft some * physical * sequences, some facial reactions, something to break the wall-to-wall yak festival. and a single prison set. No wonder the screenwriter was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who may know theater but it is revealed that he has no idea in the film. <br /> <br /> I can not overemphasize the effect of the theatrical script. has in the movie. Seeing Jesse and his mother arguing about Jesse's impending suicide is redundant and boring. The women walk from the living room to the kitchen, to the study and return to the living room, where they start all over again. A small midwestern house is not the ideal place for a single-series movie, and the director never tries anything intelligent or original, never tries to break the monotony with a shot or outside cut or a flashback or * nothing *. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... only two women who cover the sofa cushions and discuss their opinions. Is the reverence given to the work disgusting? even the most solemn classics of Shakespeare sway for the screen. Does the commitment to the original work seem almost spiteful? It is as if the film were made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the play, with the audience as a last-minute idea. <br /> <br /> The other reason why the film fails is Anne Bancroft. She may be a good theater actress, but in the film, where the presence is 80% of the performance, she rarely seems to fit. She certainly does not fit in here, playing like a midwestern grandmother, but she looks more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. He chases Jesse around the house, looks more aggravated than astonished, and seems extraordinarily unpleasant, even when his lines convey a loving woman, though defective. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is great as always, honest and open and so good that you really understand and agree with the choice of her character. Sissy allows us to see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had all the bad holidays and has made too many wrong decisions. She has never had control of her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying "No more, this is where I'm going". That's how she puts it anyway, and when Spacek talks? You listen She shows in all her films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, it does not have to be a lie, a bravado and a borrowed testosterone. In this and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter", she silently demonstrates a soft strength and a silent depth that is as impressive as hypnotic. You can not help falling in love. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to see "'Night, Mother'". Spacek is wasted in a trick of a movie that never serves to participate or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, except Sissy fans like me, and even then you will be disappointed. I give the movie a full-letter grade bonus to the end, which is brave enough to let the main character do the right thing for her and not get carried away by a trite happy ending. GRADE: C
