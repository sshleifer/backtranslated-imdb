When reading most of the other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the comments. The only thing I would add is the disjointed way in which the film has been directed and produced. I think some of these new wave movie creators think they are being smart using unusual camera angles (sometimes abrupt) and flying from one scene to another. It goes well with these film festivals and with some of these indie critics, but it ruins the movie for me. I noticed in the reviews, a comment that says that none of the films of these filmmakers has become a blockbuster. This could prove my point, since the movie has that "rush to finish" feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie seems to lack a smooth flow. As for the comment that Kiefer Sutherland is a great name to put on the poster, I would bet that he shrugged to see the final cut. This is a story with real potential, spoiled by trying to be different in its production. It is worth seeing, but not many would return for a second sight.
