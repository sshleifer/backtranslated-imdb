This movie was so good on many levels! Have you ever seen the dentist? This movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, unless, of course, you really are really really bored, then maybe. It was so cheesy. The killer reminds you of the monsters' grandfather, except that he has protective goggles on. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought I was going to kick her in the ass, but all she did was throw a frig-gen trash basket in. I felt very disappointed. when the ranger had the scene of crying over his wife, so I felt the pain behind his tears ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!!! !!! So before watching this movie, take a blanket and a pillow, make yourself comfortable because it is very relaxing.
