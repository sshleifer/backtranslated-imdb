Horrible, confusing piece of trash south of the border. Now I have seen it twice and STILL do not really know what was happening. It had something to do with a stupid Aztec mummy, a "human robot" who is the dumbest robot I've ever seen, and a woman who is the reincarnation of an ancient Aztec girl. Most of the story is told in an incredibly slow way by an incredibly boring scientist. This boy is a wonderful help to sleep. His enemy is a fat bum named The Bat, which is a rather unimaginative name for an evil scientist. <br /> <br /> I suppose the bored scientist and his worm assistant unearthed the mummy, and what a surprise, the scientist's. His wife simply HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's bride. They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I suppose for the exaggerated bad man to steal it. It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever. He is looking for some treasure the mummy has, so he can be rich. But excuse me, if the guy had this great intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why did not he just patent some of his ideas and get rich in that way? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess that would make a lot of sense. Instead, there's a ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to say which of them is fake or more corny. To tell you the truth, I saw it because I thought of a movie with a name like The Robot Vs. The Aztec mummy simply had to be fabulously corny. Instead, it was simply horrible and the mind confused.
