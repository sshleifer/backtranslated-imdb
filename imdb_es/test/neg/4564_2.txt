In general, I love genre films for teenagers and high schools, but this movie lacked originality. The only premise this film has is that four friends cheat each other in high school and the tension it puts on their friendship. There simply is not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the attention of the viewers throughout the film. The acting is not so bad, although the actors do not have much to work with, since the dialogue is triple and clich√© ... After watching this movie, one must ask how a producer can find a project like this and think, " I MUST make this movie. " No wonder I could not get a theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
