Yes, I spelled it well. This movie is so predictable, the real word needs additional letters to exemplify predictability. From the moment the main characters and the situation are presented, it is a painting by numbers as to where this plot will take us. The omen was as subtle as a two-ton hammer. You could take many dialogues and anticipate the role you would play in the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the adorable role admirably. It's just that the film brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was lukewarm and the laughter was weak and scanty. Sure, it's a good movie if you have nothing to do, but you will not miss anything when you miss this one.
