Very simply, they are all syndicated episodes and NOT the original episodes of NBC uncut / unedited. It is NOT the first full season, all eps are edited to meet 9:00 for syndication, which means that the jokes are cut, an additional commercial fade is included, all presentations by Harvey Korman are not here. Very badly done! Shame on a series that I've been waiting for .... booooooooooooooooo! If you are a true Mama fan, do not buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments about why we are not happy. In this work of butcher to a classic comedy!
