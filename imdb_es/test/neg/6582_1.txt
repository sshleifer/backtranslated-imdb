I know that most other reviews say that this movie was great, but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a good book! Actually, it was one of my favorites when I was very small. But it's just not for theaters. Maybe for a little half an hour, but I do not see how they can turn a small children's book into a full movie. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie, but I would only recommend it for very small children. Older children will not have any interest in it. Adults may have a little more interest if they see it with their little ones. But anyone age 7 or older will have a snoring festival. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you do not agree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
