The Mod Squad is not a movie, it's a vacuum. That's the most fascinating thing about that and what kept me looking. I had never seen a movie before that offered absolutely nothing. It is a film without any reason to exist, apparently consciously designed not to attract anyone, as if it had been performed solely as a contractual obligation to someone who does not like the studio. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no action scenes of fixed pieces, there are not even scenes as such, only a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about emptiness like in the stupid summer box office success, but empty as in "We still do not have the pages, so point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes of value". It makes you appreciate the "artistic achievements" of the angels of Charlie and S.W.A.T. What much else does it offer? It is too much of Giovanni Ribisi in his most tediously execrable, making his bastard son of a thousand imitators who pretend to be the acting routine of the Marlon Brando method, Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and ... no, that is. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile on one shot. And Dennis Farina has the sense that he gets killed early. Truly the most useless movie ever made, it's like L'Humanite without the jokes but, you know, for the kids.
