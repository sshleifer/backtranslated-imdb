<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad films (and MST3K, and MFT3K member), I must say that I have seen my part of them. But wow! Even the worst I've seen at least had a soundtrack. While George Lazenby wanders around Hong Kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you will not be distracted by any of the background music that fills the current cinema. Or any of that music that fills elevators. I do not think anyone in this movie does not even buzz. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not quite true, there * is * a * sound track. If you listen carefully, you'll hear it sound a half dozen times throughout the movie. Of course, the moment will be totally inappropriate and will not last long, but something that could be classified as "music" will occur. However, the best thing you can do is sit your child armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the movie offers. <br /> <br /> Look out for Sammo Hung as a little villain in this movie. Are not we glad you found Jackie Chan to work with?
