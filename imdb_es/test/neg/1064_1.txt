There is nothing original, human or insightful in this movie. The performance is average, the images are amateur, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... something like a soap. <br /> <br /> In 2: 37, a suicide is used to turn the movie into A Thriller. We look, partly, because we want to know who dies. Each of the different characters has a problem, and the film shows how serious each problem is for them, but only as a way to take them to a place where you think they could kill themselves. Despite the different points of view that the camera offers in key events, there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves. So in 2:37, the holes are holes, the angels are angels. This is something simple. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeurist story of sex and youth violence. It is difficult to get to know the children as much as the breasts, bodies and lameness that the filmmaker does as a characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know SOMETHING about the cinema in the last 5 years, 2: The 37 is just an immature scam of Elephant, not a meditation, not a progression. However, while the filmmaker and the distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every opportunity to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. Positive publications in IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply do not value originality. If you want something with heart and voice, avoid this piece of youthful exploitation. I was surprised by the age of the filmmakers when I found out after watching this movie; I had assumed that a 13-year-old boy had achieved it. The Twenty Somethings that I have always known are too busy trying to express something real in them as to lift the work of an old man.
