This is just the fourth effort I've seen from this director (whom I met and found quite cool in the retrospective of the Italian film B of the Venice Film Festival of 2004) and also, possibly, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is an excellent example of the end of the Euro-Cult era, primordial because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen at this moment! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we have a plot that revolves around: I'm not kidding, folks, a killer phone! The beautiful but insipid Charlotte Lewis, in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986), is a model who, apparently, has just finished a romance; she is still waiting for her architect's lover to return the call but, every time the phone rings, everything she receives is static accompanied by voices from beyond (or something like that). She befriends a new tenant in her apartment building who, conveniently, meets an authority in paranormal activities (William Berger), who, in a hilarious way, explains that the negative energy that is released, for example, during the family arguments, can be manifested through appliances in A deadly force (I swear I'm not making it up)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... er ... the lowest points of the film are: the grumpy bartender whose gloomy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain of events it can only be broken by having Lewis retrace his steps again, ANGEL'S EXTERMINATOR (1962) style, the great variety of absurd-looking telephones on display, the photographer's friend's device of the heroine stalking her before the murder, the sarcastic policeman Who greets Lewis when reporting on the strange events ("and what does the toaster do, I wonder?"), the alleged rapist murdered by a barrage of coins coming out of a telephone booth and the very bloody disappearance de Berger (with the phone affecting the pacemaker with which he is equipped and causing the doctor's heart to explode)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is quite confusing and, apparently, he finally sees all the " lost souls "inhabiting a flock of pigeons and flying through the window of the" possessed "office (a service of lonely hearts!). For what it's worth, the score, by none other than the former Goblin Claudio Simonetti, is effective enough, despite the inclusion of heavy metal numbers with a date on the soundtrack.
