Honestly, this was the worst movie I've seen. The performance was terrible, the story was also bad. However, it was a good idea. If this film had had better cinematic and many better actors, I could have had something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie simply destroyed him. Why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies? the only good part was when the killer put his head under the floor with a tape, that was pretty good. The swinging ax was just horrible, there was absolutely no suspense. and also when the killer is chasing everyone around, in the end, he was going from one place to another in a few seconds, it does not make any sense.
