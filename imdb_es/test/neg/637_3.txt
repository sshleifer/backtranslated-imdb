This is quite typical of the science fiction channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects. We have some loose alien sock puppets in a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does everything he can with what little he has given to a show. And save the day. All others in this are completely dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the clich√© of Lou that she does not like, and of course, returns to love him in the end. The obnoxious state senator who ate early, and a pack of bored security guards who run a lot. Then, there is an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for no reason, except to provide us with 3% more races. Pass the entire middle part of the film hidden in a box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteor that flies through the air, dragging flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if it exceeds the speed limit set on your car, atmospheric friction can cause it to catch fire. Then it lands on the hood of a car, entering horizontally. Something like a velcro ball landing on a Velcro floor, I suppose. It does not really hurt the car, it just doubles the hood a little. Later, Lou gets on a helicopter and goes after the train. Although the train only had a two minute lead, it takes half an hour to get there. The CGI is so bad that it seems that the helicopter is as big as the hills on which it flies. Then fly to the side of a mountain, this effect must be seen to be believed. It seems that they took a bottle of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the effect of the flame on the helicopter. About 10 times too big. It is not surprising that the helicopter could not arrive on time, since it had five tons of nitroglycerin. Then, the eco-terrorist eventually explodes, but instead of exploding in all directions as most explosions do, it explodes upward like a pointed cannon in the air. Then there is the agreement with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the small aliens to get off, but it seems that the aliens can really fly faster than the train, so why would this keep them on the train? I have no idea. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have a couple of hours that absolutely need to be killed, and everything depends on this movie or reruns on the Food Network, well, now that I think about it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. Generally, these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; Maybe there's a sexy girl, some T & A, or a character that really has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I really did not see any of that here.
