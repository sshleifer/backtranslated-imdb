A ridiculous comedy that receives a stirring direction. I love one of the comments here: "It could not be done today." Well, neither could "The Philadelphia Story" without a car chase or two. However, does that mean that the image is worse for wear because it is outdated? I do not think "Susan Slept Here" was good for any generation, and should resent peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds-buffs. There is no spark in this story of a screenwriter who hooks up with a much younger girl to "investigate scripts." Dick Powell makes his appearance on the farewell screen in what must have been a shame for him. Reynolds is pale. Produced by a Harriet Parsons, who gives her famous mother Louella several inane plugs. * 1/2 of ****
