This is just what we need, a program about people who do not like in high school or college. Man or woman. People who object to others and congratulate themselves for doing so are exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is just disgusting to do exactly that. <br /> <br /> So four men sit on chairs and watch two other men trying to pick up women to have sex with them. And in the end one of the two wins, great ... just f-n great. I am also supposed to accept these four showers as "judges" of the people's "Game". The term "game" has to be the most absurd thing that comes out of modern English since the term "Bling Bling", besides the fact that these men are called "experts" only make me want to throw up what is left of My respect for modern culture. These are not the damn models to follow, they are the result of the culture of MTV has bitten our asses. If you like the nonsense that spills on the sides of this monstrosity, then you probably think that Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. It is not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking like that. <br /> <br /> And for all those people who will say that I would like this better if they put me to bed, or that I'm just jealous. Go to hell, because it is obvious that a REAL girl will certainly not.
