After a series of successful films of "a man and his monkey", which included the seminal "Every Which Way But Loose", "Every Which Way You Can" and "Peter's Friends", the genre fell in difficult times. In an effort to rejuvenate this once-famous area, director Frank Marshall brought the critically acclaimed Michael Crichton novel to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Think 'Gorillas in the Mist' meets 'Tron' minus the influence of Bruce Boxleitner's box office. This is a love story condemned to a man by his talking monkey. Not helped by bad accents (Tim Curry wrestles with a Romanian), a script baboon, hungry hippos, parachute primates and Bruce Campbell. Ape-Sh * t.
