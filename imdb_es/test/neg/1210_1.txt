As a retired USAF MSG (aircraft maintenance specifications), this must be one of the worst movies I've seen. the fact that a teenager can reach the flight line, much less enter an F-16 is ridiculous. the military spend millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members look stupid. Yes, I know it's just a movie, but it conveys a message to the younger people that we're all idiots, and believe me, we're not. The logistics involved in the configuration of any type of mission is very complicated, even in the eighties, military computers were too safe to be hacked by any teenager, and the other flaws in this film make Peter Pan more credible. Sorry, for me, this movie has no entertainment value at all.
