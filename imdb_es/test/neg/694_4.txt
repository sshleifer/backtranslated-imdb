Why do the powers that remain keep Jennifer Lopez in incredible roles? She was excellent at Selena, and quite good at Money Train, who both assigned roles in which she could basically be herself. However, roles like this only draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of sight for that uncomplicated performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, LÃ³pez interprets the aforementioned psychotherapist, who participates in virtual reality experiments in which he enters the minds of his patients to help them solve their problems. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of her victims, she breaks all the rules to try and decipher the madness of her inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's performance here is generally below average. I can not get over that high-pitched shriek he has. It is not Julia Roberts, but nevertheless, it appears on the screen as if it believed to be in the same field of play. Well, she is not even in the same stadium. Sure, she's a very sexy lady; however, that is not going to lead a movie, and it certainly does not carry this one. He would have been excellent with any other character in his role for this film, especially if he had taken someone who could give the character more credibility. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this movie is visually stunning. . The colors are fabulous, and the story line is not so bad in a kind of B-series movie. The audio here is excellent too. This film earns some points for the quite original story, and important points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the performance and the poor distribution have been lowered some notches. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
