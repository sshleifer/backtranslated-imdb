What a terrible movie this was! I did about 50 minutes and started skipping chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue of the film deviates from the main story so much that its head will explode with rage. Many useless minutes were wasted just listening to the characters talk about something irrelevant to the plot, AND / or something that could be said in a shorter period of time. The work of the camera is unstable and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan needed to remove his finger from the zoom button! I also noticed that in some moments during this movie it seemed that Andy had convulsions and that he shook the camera uncontrollably. The joints between scenes were bulging and did not flow. The murder scenes were nothing special, unbelievably, and ridiculously false. Just any gore, as the title suggests. This movie takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes and the murder scenes take about 1 minute TOTAL of the whole movie, if so. What a miserable piece of junk this movie was! Andy Milligan is, in fact, probably one of the worst directors to harass humanity with his untalented leadership and his camera work. Usually, I can get over really bad horror movies and laugh at them later. BLOOD BUTCHERS, however, I can not. I'm just angry. I lost an hour and a half of my life watching this (what I would not do to get it back). Take my suggestion and DO NOT watch this movie unless you plan to fall asleep. TERRIBLE.
