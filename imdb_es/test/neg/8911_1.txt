Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is encouraged to drive an armored vehicle for a bank to hold and drive everything that crosses it. However, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells like a rat that notified the police in advance. The story has many twists and turns and the retention money has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal is framed a little in this support and, of course, is looking for the person who is trying to take him away for a long time. In this film, Seagal tries to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and it is quite boring and too long.
