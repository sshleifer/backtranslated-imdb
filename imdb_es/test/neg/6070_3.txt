Trite and unoriginal. It is as if someone had seen Amada immortal and Amadeus and decided to mix them and, in the process, steal other parts of the plot of other films to make another. As with most historical movies today, there are some inaccuracies, since history is manipulated to better fit the story, which is understandable for the most part. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write what they had to say in order for him to understand them. That, of course, would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen. The script, although full of some citable lines, does not capture the feeling of that period of time and, along with some bad performances, seems quite contemporary. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at, but she still has a lot to improve in her craft. Ed Harris does not work for me like Beethoven and I mainly blame Gary Oldman for that. In general, it is not a very good interpretation of the life of the musical master. You'd better find a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
