For weeks I had been waiting to see this movie only to find myself greatly disappointed after the movie theaters. In my opinion, the only good thing that 'River Queen' had was the incredible backdrop used as background. The story line was all over the place, Samantha's character, Sarah, was very hard to understand and what the hell were the many close-ups of her face? He did not contribute anything to the story, if there was one! A better actor for Boy's part could also have been selected, for me it sounded as if he read his lines directly from the script while filming his scenes. In general, an embarrassment, since it could have been a good movie.
