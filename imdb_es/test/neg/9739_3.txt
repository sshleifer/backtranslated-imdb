Most of you really disliked this movie ... they were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... I can not say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I have seen many silly and silly comedies, but this one surpasses them all. As I watched, I could not stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide whether I should laugh or cry, since the * REALLY STUPID * things happened on the screen and people left the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the main characters, time travel is done, simply enter any museum and you will really travel to the past. Also, if you are looking for an experience after death, go to the nearest planetarium, there you will meet the Lord, I'm sorry, Loydd and you will be given important orders ... All of the above does not make sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I see), you probably will not like it, but the writer's ability to create the STUPID script will ultimately intrigue you ... <br /> <Br /> I give it a 3 out of 10, it's not right, far from being the worst ...
