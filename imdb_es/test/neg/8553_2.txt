The ugly film of women in the cell drag the lower part of the barrel of the midnight movie, combining the sordidness of the octopuses with the clich√©s of the girls in the shower. Linda Blair plays an innocent prisoner (we found out that she was involved in running over a guy with her car), facing difficult moments in the Big House with some of the most unpleasant characters on this side of a photo of Russ Meyer Blair is continually kicked, beaten, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is disgusting throughout four letters, and the film offers no relief from its barrage of violence and stupidity. However, some viewers see this as a camp classic, although their language may not be sufficiently tense. * since ****
