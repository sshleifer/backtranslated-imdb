First of all ... I've seen a better performance and a more realistic makeup in porn movies. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" like Stewie Ungar? In The Sopranos, Chris does not take himself too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then he throws "Bobby Baccala" as one of his friends from Las Vegas. It's too much to watch a dramatic movie. Neither actor can handle a serious role and is more suitable as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made the makeup for this disaster? I want that person to be MY make-up artist for the next 25 years, so I will never grow old one day either. So that's all I'll write in this movie, since it's not worth spending much more of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
