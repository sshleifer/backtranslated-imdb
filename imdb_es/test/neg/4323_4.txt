Lon Chaney Jr. returns to the wood while the mummy Kharis looks for his companion, Annanka, whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of the descendant Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, High Priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue with his evil actions. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from certain future terror of the mummy. <br /> <br /> The predictable entry in the Kharis series shows that almost all films follow a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by a hidden corpse, with only one arm and masked in a wrap, which seems to have been endowed with a superhuman power to suffocate the lives of healthy men who are subject with relative ease by a simple strangulation of Kharis. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action ... and knows a lot about Egyptian history ... in the previous movie (The Tomb of the Mummy), shows that anyone who has survived a previous encounter with the mummy will surely die if he returns in the next movie. Well produced, but lacks originality that would differentiate it from the other films in the series. Sadly, Carradine walks through his role as the evil Yousef Bey. The shameful mistake of the script has Kharis, who is known to put a paralyzed and crippled right arm, leading to an unconscious Amina with both arms for long distances without negative effects. One aspect, the shocking climax in which Tom's attempt at heroism does not develop according to plan, since Kharis retains his damsel hostage in distress, slightly raises the film of the crisis.
