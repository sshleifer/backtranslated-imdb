This film is badly written, it is difficult to follow and presents bad performances and dialogues by the protagonists Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The premise, credible but weak (the undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the underworld of drugs) deserved better than this failure of Lili Fini Zanuck. The cast of competent support (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film also contains the worst "love" scene in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is very overrated; specifically the "Tears in the sky", disgusting and sappy without substance, of the legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is totally unbearable from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
