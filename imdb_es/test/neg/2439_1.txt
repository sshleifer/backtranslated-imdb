Laura Fraser creates her ideal man in a virtual reality machine and, suddenly, comes alive. Oh, what does not happen with a jolly jape on a Britcom flop is so bright, but so sad that it makes Weird Science's execrable American teen movie look almost decent. The script obsessed with sex is from the film critic of The Sun, Nick Fisher, a former "uncle of the agony" of the magic of adolescents, who obviously has never seen an episode of Smack The Pony in his life; Shame, because then, at least, he could have entered with a writing cry of female characters who were recognizable members of the human race. This large number of things that are extracted very clearly have emerged clearly from the virtual brain of someone who imagines that it is fun. Suddenly, the thinking of the new wave Iranian cinema is in some way attractive.
