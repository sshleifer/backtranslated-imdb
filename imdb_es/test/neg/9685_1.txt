Even though I have a great interest in biblical films, I was bored to death every minute of the movie. Everything is wrong. The movie is too long, most of the time the acting is a joke and the script is horrible. I did not understand the point of mixing the story about Abraham and Noah together. So if you value your time and your sanity stay away from this horror.
