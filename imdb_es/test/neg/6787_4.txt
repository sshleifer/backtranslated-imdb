As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian films. However, from time to time I get caught in seeing one. This is better than most, that is, mediocre. It has many of the usual failures of Canadian films ... self-conscious acting ... an excess of cinematic tricks and, above all, the Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as substitutes for American ones. I mean that using the historic metropolis of Montreal as a replacement for Harrisburg Pennsylvania is nothing short of obscene. I was in a good mood. I gave him a 4. <br /> <br />
