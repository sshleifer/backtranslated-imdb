By far, the most racist cartoon and ghetto for children over 7 years. Children who see this caricature will probably try to dress, talk and act like the characters represented. I am disappointed with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to broadcast this terrible program. The Wayan brothers can be good at movies aimed at young adults. They should stay in the movies and not make more episodes for this cartoon. In general, young celebrities start working on movies and voice-overs for cartoons and then, as they grow up, move on to young adult programs. A good example is Nick Cannon. He started appearing in All-That, then starred in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his television show, Nick Cannon, presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how celebrities who watched children on television not long ago can become people who participate in programs not suitable for children. It is very sad that this happens, but all celebrities change and grow. It's exactly the opposite with the new Wayan's Brothers cartoon. It is bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people in the ghettos, by allowing the younger generation to see this program, it will only turn children into possibilities for those who do not have the opportunity of a good life. Only my feelings about this caricature and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they were to see it.
