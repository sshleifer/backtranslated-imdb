OK, I admit that I'm still associating Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason why I went to see this movie. But it was so boring, I almost fell asleep. I'm sorry, but her talents as an actress are not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented with outstanding special effects and CGI. Yes, for a B movie it's not that bad. After having seen her in "Marquise" a few years ago (also a very bad movie), I thought that she would play more convincingly. But La Boum (and may be James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movie with her. Is it his "talent", does he have bad taste when he chooses his films or simply has bad luck?
