Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a remake, since in this year the remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on a previous movie. It's not because this is a meaningless re-movie. That is the director who has used the original script of the camera for shots taken similarly to the "remake" of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the angles of the camera are identical, no attempt is made to embellish or restructure the original script, (but with a director like Van Sant at the helm, we should be grateful Surely not Hitchcock) In fact, it might even be correct to say that the wardrobe could be the same because the private eye wears a pig cake hat. Did not they go out of fashion in the late 1960s? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Avoid
