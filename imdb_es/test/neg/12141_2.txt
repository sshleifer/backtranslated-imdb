I grew up watching the "Bowery Boys" on weekends and even at a young age, I could say that this was inexpensive as the name implies. However, it was fun to see Satch (Hall) get the best out of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs hit him. The things of East Side Kids were never shown, although they were public domain and probably cheap to run, it was a low standard for children to tune in even though we only had about 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am reviewing about my childhood. I can not find any Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids on a disc and also on a public domain website. Fortunately, I saved my mass and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free, and it really works. Now I can see that there are some Bowery Boys and maybe lovers of the bad Monogram movies here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 out of 10, but folks, this is not even trying to be funny. It's an East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best part was watching Muggs fight in the end, it reminded me that my days in elementary school were fading like a girl when I got into a fight, it was a bit abusive. Leonard Maltin said in his mini-biography that this movie is one of the best, so you can imagine the rest. If you want to see some decent action on the East Side, you can see Ghosts in The Loose, but the end result is that the comedy team starts strong in his career and is reduced, these cups exploded the dishes and then picked it up slowly until that dominated Hall's antics. of what they were at best. There are still 2nd level things below the 3 puppets, which they imitate but which are fun for those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring pleasant memories of "Bowery Boys" and it is better to leave it in the hands of Monogram fans.
