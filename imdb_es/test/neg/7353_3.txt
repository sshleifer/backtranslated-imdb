Why would Burt Lancaster allow himself to play a poor imbecile who is finally undermined by the fatal woman Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum gets carried away as another loser who falls in love with the femme fatale Faith Domergue in the 1950 noir, "Where Danger Lives." Perhaps both felt that it was a good way to show that they had "rank" as actors, that playing against the type, the usual role of "tough guy" they were known for, would improve their image as actors who could play any role. . But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the pathetic lover of love in Criss Cross, did nothing to improve the career of Lancaster. Lancaster is not only completely wrong in the role of a single note by Thompson, but there is something inherently unpleasant (and I can say, pathetic) about the protagonist of the film in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'Criss Cross' is an endlessly slow movie. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is the beginning: the flashback that chronicles Thompson's confrontation with Dundee by Dan Duryea at the nightclub. Everything that happens in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture: the illicit affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez, the policeman and his bad blood with Dundee. If Director Siodmark felt compelled to start the movie with a flashback, why not keep it in less than three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> In 'Criss Cross', it takes a long time before the protagonist commits and leaves the 'ordinary' world of Act One. That's the scene where he "passes" and "meets" "Anna in the nightclub. And watch how Siodmak spends so much time between Anna dancing and Steve watching her? In addition to the cross section, he also spends a lot of time concentrating on Esy Morales and his Rhumba band to move the story. <br /> <br /> Until the crisis of the second act, the story is fair and Thompson had several uncomfortable encounters with Anna and then drowning her sorrows in her usual trough. At the midpoint of the second act, he learns that Anna has escaped and married Dundee. It is clearer at this point that one of the main weaknesses of the film is that Dundee is never on the screen for most of the second act. There are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee during this time and we are left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovers. As it turns out (and Anna "explains" this later to Steve), the one she left was not just because he disappeared for eight months, but she also felt the pressure from Steve's mother and direct threats from Martinez, the policeman who gave him to understand that he would see to it that she ended up in the House of Detention for Women. Anna returns with Steve because he realizes that he made a big mistake with Dundee. It turns out that he has been hitting her and now he is afraid of her. <br /> <br /> One of the silly sayings uttered by more than one. The character of Criss Cross is that you can never hijack an armored vehicle. But everyone is surprised when Steve points out that it can be done if it is an "internal job"! I would have thought that Dundee would have known about Steve's "profession" as an armored vehicle driver and proposed it in advance. But, of course, Steve needs to make the proposal so that Dundee does not kill him after discovering his adventure with Anna (if they are so afraid of being caught, why are Steve and Anna in their apartment where Dundee can find them so easily? )?). I really liked Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the "brain" of the operation. Dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex-teacher who plans the robbery on a map. Oh, there's the question of procuring the ingredients to build the gas bombs used during the robbery and, of course, Finchley is good at that too! <br /> <br /> The only really well-made scene in the whole movie is the armored car robbery. The edition was quite good, as it showed the rising stock of a robbery that went wrong. As the gas bombs go off, the gang's brutality is shown in high relief when Dundee murders the innocent Armored Car Guard. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie is as long as the rest of the movie. Why does one of Dundee's thugs take so long to kidnap Thompson? There's that nurse, then the thug is waiting outside, then he goes in and pretends he's a friend, Steve falls asleep, and finally, after he wakes up, the thug kidnaps him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at the house, we wonder how Anna got the cash. Did he somehow steal it from Dundee after the robbery when he went out to dinner? It is never explained. Worse yet, Anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of nothing. Before, his selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by his perceived rejection at the hands of the threats of Steve and Martinez. But after returning to Steve because he fears Dundee, he inexplicably turns against him when he is most vulnerable. Just as there is 'instant coffee', it has 'instant femme fatale'. <br /> <br /> In "Film Noir? An Encyclopedic American-Style Reference" by Silver and Ward, the authors say "Criss by Cross" as "one of the most tragic and compelling of black cinema." I am sorry I disagree. To have a tragedy you need characters with great depth and to be convincing you need a story that is plausible. Criss Cross does not have any. It is an overrated "B Movie" that has somehow been found in the pantheon of the house of art noirs. Once again, the herd mentality has triumphed when evaluating the images of yesteryear.
