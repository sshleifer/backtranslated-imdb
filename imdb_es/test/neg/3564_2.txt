A depressed and spooky teenager does a lot of bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use curtains or drapes in her windows. He agrees a variety of things from her, looks at her, makes jokes and makes her a variety of unpleasant tricks. Interestingly, he does not keep any of this secret to her. At first, she does not seem to care one way or another that he is bothering her. Then, later, it seems that he begins to respect him for his cruel and feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical elements that must be taken into account. One is that the boy looks out at night through a glass panel from the brighter side. In real life such a thing would not happen. The most illuminated side of a crystal acts like a mirror. He would not be able to see exactly anything. In addition, all who are in the night can look at it from their well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical element is that the spooky teenager takes a job as a milkman, and his and the only client every morning seems to be the lady he is dealing with. Easy work, if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE in a public exhibition. In the end, there was not a single open eye in the house. A short film about love is the film in a foreign language for those who do not like to read the subtitles. Not only are very few words spoken in the film, but much of the film is silent. A certain rest in peace.
