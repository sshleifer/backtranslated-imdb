I'm glad that this was the last of the Universal Mummy films of the 1940s. The films were all of varied qualities and this movie was definitely one of the smallest. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a very slow movie, in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is happening. Maybe it would have been better if the mummy had made her entrance earlier in the movie. Instead, now the film passes once again its first 20 minutes explaining everything that had happened in the films of previous mummies, also using once again the archive file of this time "The Mummy" of 1932, for which film is the fourth mummy film following The Story of the Mummy of 1932. The film never knows how to find the right rhythm and, although the film barely lasts more than an hour, it still feels a bit like a drag. <br /> <br /> Of course, it also does not help that the movie has a rather simplistic story and actually very uninteresting. The film also feels quite disjointed. The first and second half of the film did not really connect with each other and seemed like two separate films by themselves. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. is still in it. Once again repeat the role of the mummy Kharis, for the third time. Too bad he had such a limited screen time this time. Unfortunately, it gets very uninteresting to do, which is also a great waste of the character of the mummy itself. The movie is even more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing with foolish accents. I found it totally unnecessary that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and actually become quite upset and annoyed in the points. <br /> <br /> Mummy movies that are less worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
