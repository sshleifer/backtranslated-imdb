I had the fun opportunity to see this at Mystery Science Theater 3000, four years ago. I must admit that it was not as badly done as other science fiction / horror films of the time. The plot revolves around an astronaut who returned to earth with an alien embryo inside him. Now the plot is pretty weird, well, even if you can call that a plot. (Seeing an exhausted space program in a building and an old van is fun!) I admit it was horrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I've been watching and being enchanted by this film for 43 years . He is not even close to the evil of Invasion of the Neptune Men, Hands: Hands of Fate or Future War. <br /> <br />
