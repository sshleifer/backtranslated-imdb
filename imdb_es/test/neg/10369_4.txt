A severe step backwards for the puppets in this mainly boring and tedious exit. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in the third part, hardly appears on this occasion, and the fantastic melody of Richard Band appears with the puppets a few minutes from the film. For the start of the film, we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his young friends (many of the actors are Canadian and all are very good in unfortunately demanding roles: Teresa Hill is quite rich). The totems, subjects of the Egyptian god Sutek want to recover the secret of the life of the animation and the puppets (when they come to the surface) act with a never before seen ability to try to destroy the ugly computer games. The Totems simply complicate the series and distract the things that previously made the series so unique: they do not share the strange beauty of the puppets and, therefore, do not fit. The main scene is Pinhead, who uses a cloth to clean the blood. Tunnelers broca, classic and about the biggest thing that this movie goes. The fifth film was filmed at the same time it is, so expect similar sections of mediocre and a performance of Toulon that seems to have been filmed at a different time (or even in a galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and fans of the series certainly do. Grrrrrrrr.
