If this is the best of Finnish cinema at the moment, I would say that the big taxes that the euros spent on supporting "culture" have been wasted here in a horrible way. Paha maa is the worst example of how to try to make a Finnish "European film" for large audiences. I'm sure they wanted it to be modern, intelligent and moving at the same time. The result is shit. <br /> <br /> In short: - History is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for the characters. I can imagine them thinking about making a film in which "everything would go back to shit and people would feel hurt and feel very bad inside, because the Finns are also very depressed, and they themselves -this is so bad", what that leads us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is loaded with clichés, mainly about "the Finnish mentality". The way he deals with people's problems and their causes could be directly from a regular women's magazine or from a cheap self-help book on bull psychology. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they also saw Kaurismäki, to find out what people like about their movies, they misunderstood it completely and came up with a boring and depressing story about the people who go through all kinds of s ** t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It's a real shame they threw Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And of not being. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst fails, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. The movie is very unoriginal. It is also frustrating to see the endless ill humor and suffering without any real revelation. I can go through this kind of mind ** ck if the movie is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime as in, for example, von Trier is breaking the waves. There were none these in Paha maa. However, in reality, I started to laugh at some point because the turn of events was again too predictable, exaggerated and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who is this shit? And who likes it? I hope you are pretending.
