Well, I realize that IMDB has not offered any information about the plot ... that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting ... because that's what this movie is ... VILE AND DISGUSTING !! I saw him because I'm a huge fan of Chris Noth, whom I've met in person and he's a great guy ... but if I ever meet him again, I'll have no qualms about asking him whatever he has to star in something so horrible He plays a child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his free time running over young children with his car, with the intention of mutilating and paralyzing them ... this is not a "spoiler", because all this is done clear from the beginning ... is it sick enough? Oh, it gets better ... he's manipulated to do this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to suspend his sexual favors if his last victim does not die ... even Clive Barker could not write anything so horrible. . Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
