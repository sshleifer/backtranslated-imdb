Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this) allows the strongest voice to be that of Helmut Berger. How can it be? What a lost opportunity! We came out of this terrible experience knowing less about what I did to the great Master and more about the things that one should not worry about at all. The beautiful images belong to the world of Visconti, the embarrassing interviews with Berger and Zeffirelli to the diminutive world of Adam Low. A must to avoid!
