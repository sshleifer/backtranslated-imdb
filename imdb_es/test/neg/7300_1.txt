A post-apocalyptic warrior goes to save some kind of nun and on the way he meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. This is one of the most difficult films to watch in history. There are scenes with silence that seem to last for hours before someone comes out with the next wrongly written and badly acted line. There are recurring action sequences, and we are not talking about the rapid fire action 1-2-3 in a particularly good kick that was made popular by the eastern directors, we are talking about many, many repetitions of sequences of long fights and bad. . This is incredibly confusing at first, but then quickly becomes annoying when you are watching a sequence of 30 seconds for the second, third and fourth time. Any plot or vision is lost within the confused continuity, the only thing that keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet of a friend that I could not see it completely without asking him to turn it off) and eliminated safely so that it does not harm to anyone else, is the fact that, although it is painful, this film is, unintentionally, hilarious, I'm not fanatical at all of those films "so bad that fun", but in parts I was in tears. Other points to highlight are the quality of the sound and the image, but this is forgivable as it is obvious that money was a major problem in the making of this film. Final verdict: King of the genre "so bad that it's fun", anyone who has that kind of genre video night should get a copy. Let's not forget that it's actually the worst movie I've seen.
