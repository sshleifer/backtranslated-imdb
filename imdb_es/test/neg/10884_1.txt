I have seen many movies. In fact, I love horror movies B, they are one of my favorite genres. However, this "garbage" (I refuse to acknowledge that he was awarded the honor of the movie) was the worst piece of shit the torture of seeing ever had. In fact, I enrolled in IMDb just for the fact that I needed a way to at least express how horrible this "garbage" was. I have seen "Movies" (which at least deserve honor) made in the basements by high school students who were better written and directed. I have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this "junk" because they were trying to win a paycheck. Now and forever they will have this stain on their records as a virgin who was raped and given Herpes! If the writer / director John Shiban has some dignity left, after he has evidently joined with countless people to achieve it, he should never again allow himself to approach a camera and try to apply his so-called "Gifts" to something more suitable for him. ... How to clean the floor of a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
