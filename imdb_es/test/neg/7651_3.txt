When my parents rented this movie, I expected a very funny movie because Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not so funny and it is also boring. You can see the surprise that comes a mile away and lengthens for a movie that supposedly only has eighty-one minutes long. So I can honestly say that it is not a movie that is on my favorites list. It may work for some people, but it just did not work for me, proving to be a bit slow in the accumulation with practically nothing that would amuse me in the whole movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of actors and actresses very bland. The premise of the film had potential, as did Quaid's casting, but all this simply sizzles and the inclusion of the element of horror seems very unnecessary. Of course, the only dream sequence that the child had when he jumped on the bed and suddenly became a swirl of blood was very well made and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror, instead of one that lists comedy. as your first genre.
