Well, where do we start? There was great potential for this movie with big stars playing a role. But the whole story was ruined by a horrible plot. This movie did not turn out to be what I would expect, the good guy does it with life, I mean, nobody wants the good to succeed. The end was very worth it and very clich√©, I did not think about it anymore, I HAVE THE PLOT BAD, THE BAD, THE GUYS MUST GET TO SUCCESS. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time I spent doing something else. This movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think that the actors made this movie for some quick cash from Las Vegas, without a doubt. SAVE your money watch a better movie.
