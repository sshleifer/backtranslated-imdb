I just saw "Wild Rebels" in one of the compilations of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" file, and this movie was so bad that not even the MST3K team could make it entertaining. There are some "objectives" of MST3K that were films whose concepts were so small that they could not possibly have been good movies (like "The Green Slime"), and others whose basic premises could have become genuinely entertaining movies if their filmmakers had done it . I did not swing them in the execution. "Wild Rebels" is a film whose basic premise DID is a good movie three years before, when Don Siegel directed his remake of "The Killers" in Universal. Both films are about a failed racing driver who has been seduced by a fatal woman to drive the car in a robbery devised by the woman's boyfriend, only in "The Killers" the driver was John Cassavetes, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal brain. (issued in a wild but successful way against the guy in what turned out to be his last movie) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are a comedown! But what REALLY makes "Wild Rebels" a horrible movie is the direction of William Gref√© (note the accent on the final "e" present in his screen credit), which has absolutely no sense of rhythm and seems to let everything Shot run at least half again, whenever necessary to make your point dramatic. It's just a pity someone did not make a mocking comment about this movie now (in 2009); The comparison between the hairstyle of Steve Alaimo and that of Rod Blagojevich would have been irresistible!
