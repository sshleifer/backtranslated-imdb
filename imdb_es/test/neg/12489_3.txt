At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says that "Sarkar" is his tribute to The Godfather. This feels more like an insult. It pales terribly compared to the Coppola classic. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film created a lot of expectation and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character who automatically makes instant comparisons with Supreme Bal Thackeray of the Indian political party Shiv Sena. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from abroad and gets involved in Sarkar's politics at home. Like Al Pacino in the original godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood rates, incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and lack any solid foundation. Fast phone calls and sudden announcements rotate the film from one direction to another. Abishek delves into the murky political underworld and nexus of crime as a duck takes to the water. Amithab Bachchan, as Sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful, only ends up looking old and clueless. Most of his performance focuses on constantly looking at different things around the set of the film: the actor in front of him, the floor or in some other random direction. <br /> <br /> However, Kay Kay performs extremely well as the offended older son Vishnu. The same goes for Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai-based drug trafficker who wants to stand up in Mumbai. This actor has an impressive presence on the screen and can send chills down his back with the way he looks. The moment you enter the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite all its obvious flaws, the film did well at the box office. The buzz and the big star obviously help. Verma also manages to maintain her interest even slightly towards the second half of the film. Actually it's making a sequel to this one that I'm sure will be more of the same.
