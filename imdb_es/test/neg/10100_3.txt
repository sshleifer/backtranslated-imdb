When The Legends Die is a powerful and moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who becomes Tom Black Bull, a Bronc Rider champion. Raised in the old style, Tom receives the name of a white man and must adopt the language and the ways in which the white man lives in that world. Embittered by the role in which he has been forced, Tom finds his accomplishment doing one thing, knocking down horses, riding them to death, at the rodeo. The film has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who finally dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who develops a reputation as a horse killer in the rodeo arenas. Well, you should read the book, this movie does not come close to doing justice to the story.
