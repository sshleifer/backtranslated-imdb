I saw this with my children, they love it, but she did not get carried away by the reindeer of the song, but what the hell in this fucking movie they hit her with the sled, it's like what the hell why, when my children heard the sinking, they thought it was good, but we saw that they were like this "dad, why grandma", that's how my kids say grandma, any way my kids said this "dad, why was grandma hit by a Sleigh "I told them that the movie was very bad. They agreed, it's sad why there would be someone named dog "Doofas", who is mute and when all those who dressed in black looked like that, I mean, Daphne looked like a Gothic girl. one looked like Goths and in the song they found the grandmother on the floor, I think she died in the song, but in this strange fucking movie that was gone, I think they should take off the show. Everyone would love it. from 10
