Well, for each one, but I thought that Gibson's Hamlet was the most frightening performance I had ever witnessed ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I saw the movie until the end was that I had the hope that it would improve or become involuntarily funny. Unlucky. <br /> <br /> Without disrespecting the cast of support or the staging of Zefferelli, but nothing can compensate for the confusion of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough warrior, as a romantic poet, etc., etc., etc. But, in my humble opinion, this representation was just a great lack of ingenuity along with most of the weak hams.
