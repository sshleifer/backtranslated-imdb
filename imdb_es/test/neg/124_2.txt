STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Former policeman of New Orleans Homicides Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is reassigned to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico to help the police in their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation in their city. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, also known as Jase of East Enders), who uses a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to defeat him, which leads the two men to an explosive final showdown where only one will go alive. <br /> <br /> After Till Death, Van Damme seemed to be on a halt, proving that he could do his best directly for video films in the stock market. While that was a film much more drama oriented, with The Shepherd has returned to the high kicks, there is no action that made him famous for the first time and sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's not as bad as that movie, but what I said is still standing. <br /> <br /> A boring and predictable movie, with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is consists mostly of some fight scenes, trying to look cool and fashionable with some cheap slow-motion effects that were added to them that, unfortunately, make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican film, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a feeling of Robert Rodriguez / Desperado, but this only adds to the desperation. <br /> <br /> VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and since he has never been an actor of Robert De Niro, that can not be good. As a villain, Lord should not expect to leave the beeb in the short term. He gets little dialogue at first as he struggles to put together an American accent, but he gets mysteriously better towards the end. All cast actors are equally bland, and do nothing to elevate the spirit of the films. <br /> <br /> This is a pastor who has moved away from the flock. *
