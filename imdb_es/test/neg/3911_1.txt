There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD! I have no idea why this movie was made or how they managed to get Dennis Hopper to star in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The movie is stupid. I liked the idea of ​​the "little square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene with a cyborg, apart from that, avoid this movie at all costs.
