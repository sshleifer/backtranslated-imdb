With some pretty good special effects from Rick Baker and Deran Serafian in a small role, this rather scarce Italian film deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for continuing to make gore movies, while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have switched to low-profile TV movies. As for plankton, it's half Piranha, half The Thing, with people who turn into monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. The ultra-grimy, shoddy, and too-sexual feel of the film makes it difficult to enjoy. Only print jobs floating around are available in Italian.
