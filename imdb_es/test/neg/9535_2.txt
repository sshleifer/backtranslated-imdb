THE OTHER is a supposed "horror" movie made during the seventies. It should not be confused with the similar title of THE OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandchildren something that is simply known as "the game". "One of these twins, Niles, is supposed to be" good. "The other, Holland, is supposed to be evil. <br /> <br /> The idea seems quite interesting as an abstract concept and the film was adapted I can only hope that the novel would be interesting, since the film was incredibly boring from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The execution of this film is very similar to a television movie of the kind that UK residents could see it on Channel 5. In fact, this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime movie for this television channel, a slight cut of one or two scenes and this would be a movie rated by the U of the type of Disney products, but even younger children are more likely to be bored than scared by THE OTHER. <br /> <br /> You do not have to check the director's resume to realize that the horror It is not your strong point. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on the characters to drive the story. This is obvious from the beginning. I have not seen any of his other movies, but TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a crime movie of great repute on this site. Unfortunately, in THE OTHER, the characters are given very little to do and the persevering script ensures that the movie never takes off in the way one might expect. <br /> <br /> The address is as insipid as you can possibly find. Almost all the scenes take place during the day! Think about this: a scene shot in an open landscape in rural America during the day with the camera focused on a large area. Does it sound frightening or atmospheric? Believe me, it is not. It is presented as something more like an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, both the television series mentioned above and THE OTHER were filmed in California. <br /> <br /> There is a remarkable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem quite useless. <br /> <br /> The ending was clearly meant to be very disturbing and perhaps influenced another film of this period. I will not reveal which movie, but I will give 2 clues: a child was a main character and the film is well known. And I will add that the concept was used for a much greater effect in the last movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good and it's the only reason why I've awarded 2 stars. The actors who play the twins, together with the actress who plays the grandmother, try their best for the little material that is given to them. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is completely lost in an ungrateful role as the mother of the twins. Do not be fooled by its high turnover in the cast list. She has very little time on the screen and her presence simply appears as a plan to charge her long career on television to help attract television viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid a lot of attention to the advertising on the back of the DVD cover (of the Region 2 version in the UK). Comparisons were made with THE EXORCIST, which I thought was a complete insult to that movie. There is no comparison. THE EXORCIST had everything that this film should contain, but it does not contain it: suspense, tension, ironic humor, highly disturbing content, great performance, excellent characterization and participation of the spectator. Ironically, THE EXORCIST was made just a year later, but in terms of style and execution it seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as THE OTHER. THE OTHER is presented as a work that would have seemed docile in the 1950s, much less in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The 1970s was a great time for horror movies with classics like THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASACRE, THE LEGEND OF THE HOUSE OF HELL, LOT OF SALEM, to name just a few produced. For this reason, THE OTHER demonstrates even greater disappointment. <br /> <br /> If someone finds the synopsis of THE OTHER interesting, they may want to read the book or investigate a little more about it. I advise everyone to skip the movie.
