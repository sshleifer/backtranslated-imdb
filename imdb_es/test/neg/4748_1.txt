With this film I really hoped that the idea was to compensate for the ineptitude of the first AVP, and yet to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes I was in the first moments of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the birthplace of Predator (a disposable digital matte paint, but it's still nice to see at last) and then, of course, humans (if you can refer to such badly written characters) are presented ... <br /> <br /> One must wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie of Aliens and Predators. At a minimum, the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> The characters are set up in the same way we would expect the worst Friday the 13th. The pizza delivery scene was indifferent just like any other character interaction scene that followed it. Bimbos and non-actor teenagers do not make a REAL movie, they make a cheap movie, and the Alien 1-3 and Predator movies were good because they were produced over the concept (remember that 1st Alien is a "B" movie made like a movie "A") The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity, which could have been rectified simply by knowing their Alien + Predator roots: In the Alien and Predator films we are presented with characters that are part of a larger group (Foreign: Workers of Refinery, Foreigners: Marines, Foreigner 3: Convicts and in Predator movies we usually follow the main part of a unit's hero: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises began to go wrong: in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates ... or something like that, AVP do we have ... explorers? ... with weapons? and, of course, in AVP-R we have clichés of adolescents. What is there to identify yourself here? In concept, the idea of ​​a returning convict in a small town and a returning war vet seemed to be the scene of an action hero of the First Blood type, but like many other things, it was never paid. <br /> <br /> The movie Manufacturing is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. There is no sense of impulse towards action, only small sequences that generate the most minute levels of tension or interest only to cut them when they are getting interesting ... taking the audience out of the movie at all times. The action scenes themselves, although they are very bright in the trailers, are so dimly lit that it is literally impossible to know what happens during the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically, the film is hampered from many levels. Bad actors combined with bad direction and an atrocious script (which, as I realized myself a screenwriter, seemed to hit all the wrong notes and cliché that only the most devalorized writer and without ideas could have mixed) WRITE, if You can call it that, it is not even direct to the quality of the video, nor does it show a bit of respect for the established tradition of previous entries in the series. Why, suddenly, the Predalien has the ability to shoot alien embryos through the throat of a pregnant woman to use as an incubator for breast thieves? It's more than likely because the brain-dead script writer needed a way to have more extraterrestrials for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as quickly as possible.) Why a nonsense little conversation between cardboard cutouts in sticks (that is, the supposed characters) replaces the development of the real character (remember that a character is defined by what he DOES, DO NOT SAY) Why does the Sheriff take civilians to a stash of Weapons? (Is not he a law enforcement officer?) How does everyone's bimbo know where they are? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to remove the mask VERY SLOWLY before it attacks? The aliens are still falling into that nasty habit of the post-Alien 3 series of whistling everything? The time to let their prey know how to run? How the hell this series became a character that says "People are dying ... we need weapons? " (How this writer even works is beyond me, and reflects badly on Fox's already destroyed Artistic Reputation.) It's like every one of the people involved in making this movie suffered a mental disability or is really inept at all levels of the process of the film. <br /> <br /> EFFECTS are pretty bad this time.The aliens look like men in suits and ADI is becoming lazy with the design of their creatures.The aliens look like modified remnants of Alien Resurrection , with that same voluminous muscles around the arms as if they had not learned from that film that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle in. Once again, everything is wrapped in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere, but just to hide how bad the creatures look, and like in AVP, Stan Winston is very surprised when the false face of Predator is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many mistakes to list, so I'll just say this: Do not waste your money on this movie. . Fox is beyond worrying about fans, since this cheap and shoddy movie is clearly evidence of that. I felt bad for taking my girlfriend to see him (although it was free) and I apologized to her after all. This is a diehard fan who has finished the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not a meaningless slasher movie, it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook, which was better than anything you produced for this post-1993 franchise. < br /> <br /> Close session.
