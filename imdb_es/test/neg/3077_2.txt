Usually, I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I saw the movie I'm reviewing. With this, I just can not explain. I needed to wake up early to work the next day, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I did not know anything about. But something kept me stuck to my comfortable futon while I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, it's true. Boredom. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, a bohemian madwoman who seems more obsessed with her wedding vows than with the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to leave in search of better things (work, women and scripts, probably), Joline begins a fanatical search to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". It seems that I am inventing this, but unfortunately, I am not doing it. Actually, this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham, since she gives this role Phoebe-from-Friends an exercise. Oh, and Goran "ER". Visnjic is also there, for some reason. <br /> <br /> The television shows had this as a comedy but I could not find a single laugh anywhere. I was surprised that this was a personal trip for Lisa Krueger (the director and writer), in the same mold as "Girl, Interrupted", but even that had more laughs than this. Graham's character is simply too self-centered for the audience to worry and I felt sorry for the chicken-eared husband as he fought valiantly for his liberation from his clearly mental wife. Very little of this movie made sense since the characters simply appeared in the story as if they were standing, hoping that Graham would appear as extras on "The Truman Show." In fact, the only positive note I can produce from my scribbles was "Heather Graham - beautiful baps". And it was not because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In truth, it is very difficult to think of someone to recommend this movie. Graham purists (a VERY small number of moviegoers in general, I think they will agree) will have to commit to watching this scum and, possibly, the hippy students who collect the dream-catching American Indians will take some of this . I was surprised that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0, that would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and that just is not right. "Committed" is a strange and strange disorder of a movie that neither entertains nor illuminates. It's complicated, meaningless and simply too boring for my taste and probably yours too. Do not even think about seeing this.
