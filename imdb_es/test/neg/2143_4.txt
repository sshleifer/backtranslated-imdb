Ahem ... I think I'll be the only one to say this, but yes, I was a little bored during the movie. It does not mean that this is a bad movie, in fact it is a very good attempt to portray the most intimate emotions: dilemma, grief, love ... especially the director's debut (read from somewhere, is that true?). I felt that something is not right, maybe it's just me, I'm not attracted to the characters enough to immerse myself in their world. This is a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and brief dialogues, the director tries to relate the life of a simple boy and how he manages with the news of his illness laughing every time. Oh, since his laugh was kind of cute at first, but gradually it comes to me, such a deep roar for a gentle man! I must say that I did not feel the impact that most of the readers felt, in fact, I was more attracted to trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds with their sister that clearly shows that they are comfortable with each other, the grandmother who came I'll be back for another chance: this is a bit melancholy, the thoughtful gesture of writing the procedures for your father. Hmm, but this is predictable. Do not get it wrong that I am an action lover, independent films are my cup of tea! Maybe I only have a great expectation after seeing many deep films that have stronger images. Some Asian films that are worth seeing: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (describes loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (gang members live in a local environment) Before dawn and Before sunset (I only have to mention them even though they are not Asian movies.) Fans will understand!)
