Now you can really call it a movie. I knew that some of the Japanese movies are good for nothing more than this, right? I mean, com'om I fell asleep three times in this movie. No horror, a small percentage of comedy (0.2-0.5). Action we admit that it has some but the scenes are badly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. They were not convincing. The script is also horrible. I mean, this movie can be great, REALLY, but for the 60's (I'm not 100% sure). I recommend NOT to see it, unless you want to get bored as much as I do. I can not understand well this movie has its classification. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡This is a personal opinion, of course. I do not want to offend anyone, but who would like this shit? So I hope this helps someone NOT to waste time "enjoying" this movie. However, it is your choice!
