<br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed in the midst of a large audience with giggles. <br /> <br /> Very often you see the KADOSH characters looking forward to the nothingness. Unhappy faces very intense, very thoughtful, very serious. During these moments a very serious music is listened, simply to make sure that the spectator realizes that the scene that is being watched is not about fun and games. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining parts of this movie are among the many thoughtful ones. stare We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two duties. One is to raise as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is to remain employed to free their husbands from having to work. What are these men doing with their ample free time? They pray. And we learn that at home they pray aloud: "I thank you for not having created me as a woman". And in their place of worship, they pray to thank for the possession of functioning male genitalia. <br /> <br /> Along with prayer, there are many scenes of frantic antics, screaming and endless head movements and bodies that swing back and forth. and mixed with everything there are many intricate and strange ritual activities (or simple but equally strange). <br /> <br /> The cream of unintentional comedy comes from sex. The images of a hot and annoyed man actively exchanging bodily fluids with his wife in bed while trying to prevent his cap from falling off his scalp are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is fun, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh, yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The rubbing of the feet stops before something happens and the husband starts shaking his head with autism and balancing his body until the scene ends! <br /> <br /> There are three attractive females in close states of nudity, however KADOSH does not contain nudity at all. Technically, there are some interesting images and nice uses of light and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being a filthy woman who is not worthy of having a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed with which a man can quote a phrase from ancient writings, I suggest YENTL by Barbra Streisand. <br /> <br />
