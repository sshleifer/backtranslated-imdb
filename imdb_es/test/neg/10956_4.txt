This is an entertainingly bad b-movie. Actually, it is much better quality than many movies b. I had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematography and I've seen worse performances. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and it was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously, not the Oscar material, and if you do not like zombie movies, or B movies, you probably will not enjoy this, but if you are, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of Clint Eastwood is the western character. It's pretty good, though they never clearly explain how he can heal himself from shooting and zombie bites. But if he has more than a line of dialogue where his bad performance is really evident. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending for, at least I thought. Romero should be flattered if he ever saw this.
