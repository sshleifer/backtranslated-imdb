I once had a conversation with my parents who told me that British moviegoers in the 40s and 50s would verify the country of origin of a film before going to see it. It did not matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American movie, people would want to see it and if it was British people would not want to see it. This may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after watching THE ASTONISHED HEART, I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema to home grown variety in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> British equity It was devoid of members of the working class and is shown in this film. Everyone speaks with a high class English accent of dee daa that makes the British royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large number of a potential British public that would definitely prefer to see Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have done it, if he was not related to him, then he would certainly feel empathized with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than a great low-class Englishman in 1949. That's entertainment, reason why people go to theaters. Even the names of the characters seem strange - Leonora! How many Britons were named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "austere". You get the feeling that this was not marketed for a British audience in 1949. But why should it be if most British moviegoers line up in theaters to see a lot more entertaining American imports? <br /> <br /> Watching THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was surprised how old-fashioned everything was, in fact it's so outdated that I thought it might be a parody of THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not amaze me was the fact that this type of film was about to sink into the British film industry, an industry that did not recover until the American money invested in complacent fans like ZULU, ALFIE and the James Bond movies .
