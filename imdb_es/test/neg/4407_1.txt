It's not a driven argument, OK; It is not a study of characters, good; there is no action, it's okay; it does not make sense, mmm ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and the absurdity of living in Palistine and parts of Israel these days in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep-seated hostility , etc. But mostly they are long and long scenes in which nothing happens, or things that seem to be loaded with meaning (a control tower crashing to the ground, a Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a crouching tiger woman deflecting bullets at a halo) but when you try to get some meaning, there is not there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie in fast forward and it will not make any difference, except that it could be a little less boring.
