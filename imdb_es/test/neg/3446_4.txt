I like to see Robert Forster. That was the main reason why I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story that took place in the middle of nowhere, where the characters could work very well without distractions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found the movie boring. I could not be interested in the characters. I could not be interested in the story that seemed to meander nowhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I will rate the movie 4 out of 10. This falls well below the mandatory rating of 7 which makes it worthwhile to watch a movie.
