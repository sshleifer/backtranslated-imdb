The films of Yash Raj are very funny, what are the works that follow them and are called the best production house? <br /> <br /> Upon seeing the Bhatt films in operation, they copied the formula, the bikini and everything, in addition to choosing low-level actors like Uday and Tanishaa. <br /> The movie is so horrible that makes you tremble <br /> <br /> the jokes are so bad and horny that they make you slap them. Uday looks like a gay plus a monkey <br /> <br /> Tanishaa looks like an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we're all idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted Music is grace of grace The camera work is good <br /> <br /> The hams of Uday Chopra like an idiot, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying, then Tanishaa is worse, the rest is fine.
