This movie was horrible ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very deceptive because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe, none of which appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The beginning was a lot of random scenes that, most of which, had nothing to do with The Movie, except that they somehow prove that the man is a psychic ... but not too well ... <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, there is an hour of only the character of the man watching. for his daughters. It becomes vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the previous year. But that is the scope of this. <br /> <br /> And why, I can ask, was this movie rated R? There were two drops of blood and 4 curses. And how the hell did he go into a video store? This film was badly performed, badly filmed, badly written and generally horribly executed.
