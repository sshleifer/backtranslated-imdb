Honestly, I do not know in what legal or illegal substance they were (the writers) when they wrote this horrible piece of gut. <br /> <br /> The cast - stinks The plot - stinks The edition - stinks The whole premise of the film is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers meets a brotherhood of lesbian vampires, you just have to be totally out from your head to see even 1 minute of this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had to see it - was in here! Network as part of a purchase of two photos and the film that occurred after it was the real one I wanted to see. I moved quickly and was surprised by how stupid this double-speed movie was! <br /> <br /> Do not rent, buy or watch this movie ... the vampires in the movie do not. It stinks as much as the movie and the production in general! <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie of lesbian vampires - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon & Katharine Deneuve - excellent movie to see / have / rent instead of this piece of pure sh * t
