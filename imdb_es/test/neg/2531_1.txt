I was very disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the case, having read not only Mark Fuhrman's book but also the very superior "A Wealth of Evil: The True Story of Martha Moxley's Murder in the Richest Community in the United States" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who sees MURDER IN GREENWICH should know that they are watching the story of Mark Fuhrman, not the story of Martha Moxley. This movie is nothing more than an ego trip for Fuhrman. Just watch your character move as if it were the second coming (yes, even being offended by women). The actors who play the children seem too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there is a hero in this story, it is Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and her brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman entered it to make a name for himself. They, and Martha, deserve to have the true story told.
