If a movie has a trivial and unimaginative story and bland characters, you have to make up for it by being really fun. You can get away with a lot if it's fun. But while there are some funny moments scattered here and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so far away and so few that they can not begin to compensate for the hacking work that the film exhibits in such abundance. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly does not pretend to surprise anyone. When Alex is hiding marijuana in his grandmother's house in a tea can, you know what will happen later and it happens. The film seems to have been written by a committee that did a study of mediocre comedies and took any gag that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the film is its somewhat unusual configuration. . The game is developed in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some smart comedies. But do not be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. Basically, this is a frat house film from the university in which all the frat guys have been pushed into a big room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way in which the film does not take into account its configuration and uses it for the original. The laughs that can be seen in the character of JPJP are, I believe, more or less conspired by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that it is a strange genius that makes games. <br /> <br /> In the movie, J.P. He is a rare and nasty geek who is despised and booed by the company's game testers. That does not make sense at all. If you are one of the most important people in the history of videogames (as J.P. is supposed to be), even if you are peculiar and unpleasant, people will still admire you and respect you at some level. If Stephen Hawking is unpleasant, his associates are still not going to put him in the face. <br /> <br /> In addition, game testers are more likely to be geeks than JP, but in the film they are basically fraternity boys. It's a fun normal guys against the nasty dweebs movie. And although that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the context of a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual configuration for a movie, do not simply put all the movie conventions of different settings in that one. Unless you're a hack. <br /> <br /> Approximately two-thirds of the way through the film I gave up. Something happened that I knew would lead to a series of terribly predictable events. And I realized that I had not really laughed at all during the last half hour. So I stopped (although I made a quick advance just to make sure they were right to follow the most predictable clich√©s, what they did). <br /> <br /> Normally, if a movie is bad, I just say it's bad and then there are few things to say, but this movie is such an incredibly bad production that it deserves a long tirade. <br /> <br /> Shame in the film for attracting a good actress like Linda Cardellini, and then surrounding her. Nobody without talent However, I will give the film a point for giving Shirley Jones the opportunity to be the anti-Shirley Partridge.
