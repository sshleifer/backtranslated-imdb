It has been said that some directors make photos of small budgets look like blockbuster hits. Albert Pyun makes low-budget images look like movies from high school A / V projects. This movie was quite deficient in all departments. Practically all the scenes are prolonged excessively, the "experimental" lighting and the work of the camera are terrible, apparently Rob Lowe equipped to be scruffy with the performance, and the monotonous numbers of the Euro-pop slow down the film. On the positive side, Burt Reynolds does a good job with what he's given him (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T puts in another one of a recent series of gangsters of series B movies. It's not Pyun's worst job (Urban Threat), but it's certainly not his best (Mean Guns).
