The only thing that caused any of the Problem Child films was reuniting Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Apart from that, movies are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, Ben (Ritter) just separated and his little Hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs more screen time again) move to a new city infested with single maiden volunteers. Ben finally chooses Lawanda (played by SNL-er Laraine Newman, most underutilized), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies do not suit Junior in the least. To add more to Junior's torture, it seems that this city already has a small fire star in the form of a younger girl with Trixie, who casually has a single, sweet mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played the first mother horrible adoption of Junior. You can see where the plot goes from here. Finding my favorite scene is like tearing my teeth, so I think I'll go with the "Cherry Bomb in the Toilet" gag that makes James Tolkan from Back to the Future one of the many adult victims (that guy is always playing school authority ) figures). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as their parts of the first film, but unfortunately, there is no appearance of Klansmaer from Bow-tie, I mean Killer (Michael Richards), which made Problem Child even more fun. On a serious note, I'm sure these movies, whether the abusive parents saw them or not, did wonders for the redheaded children of America. We also salute these proud American films for their excellent promotion of adoption. Oh, and the dog poop jokes - I have to have dog poop jokes ... Shmucks.
