Anyone who knows anything about evolution would not even need to see the movie to say "fake". "It has never been refuted" is also a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a giant hippopotamus can not be refuted. Although, to be fair, it seems that the only people who do believe are the same people who open e-mail attachments from people who do not know or give their bank details to a guy in Zambia. No bones of any primate have been found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists do not bother to study this. The same argument applies to the monster of Loch Ness, to ghosts and to God.
