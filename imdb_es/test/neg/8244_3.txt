Oh, what the heck, I'll reveal the secret: this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some ingenious dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they do not cut it, but they are not terrible. They are only good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and I feel like watching this, without laughing, without getting excited, just, well, bored. Stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the movie really does. The box promises cowboys against dinosaurs, and in a very generic sense it is fulfilled. Boys disguised as cowboys fight against a pair of big dinosaurs. But really these guys are a lot of ladybugs, and the hero is a loser (more on that later) and the dinosaurs are not intimidating. The plot is a yawn, and there's not much technical problem with what you have to laugh at. Everything is gray and soft. <br /> <br /> After a frightful night film (filmed in one and a half colors, I called it), we get the plot that involves some people, doing things. That's what I caught. Oh, and they're at the end of the century in Mexico, so at least they dress like cowboys, even if they do not act like that. <br /> <br /> So a group of these people, who I think were human, go to the desert and run into these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse ... I do not know, let's move on). Then, the film degrades into a really pathetic King Kong scam in the final act. At that time, I had lost the will to keep my eyes on the television level, and I went in and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> The "hero" is played by the type of Beneath the Planet of the Apes. who essentially played the role of Charlton Heston when Heston decided he did not want to be in the sequel. He was chosen because, shock or 'shocks, he looks exactly like Heston. That is all that is in his favor. He was really upset when he was the hero of the movie because all he does is frown, mock, pocket the girl in the movie (who's called TJ?) Unfortunately, she's not a prostitute or, finally, the origin of the name would have been revealed). Meanwhile, your friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day several times and, what do you get for it? No recognition, not nothing! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They do not even wait for it while they escape! <br /> <br /> Bored, long, slow, with little to enjoy until the film decides to copy the King Kong script for itself, it is better to avoid this movie unless you enjoy the pain on the scale of dropping an anvil in your eyeball.
