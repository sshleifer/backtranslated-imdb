1983 was an excellent year for Stephen King's books that made it to the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo made themselves known a few months apart. While The Dead Zone was easily the group's choice, Christine and Cujo were pretty bad, and it's a short-term issue as to which is the lesser of the two. If they asked me for an answer, I would say that Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, recent arrival of the success as the mother of Elliot in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage with her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) is hanging of a thread. She has been having an affair with a local worker, and now she is thinking about whether or not to leave her husband. Dragged into marital distress is the young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, and a rather messy child with a chronic phobia of darkness that often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby auto repair shop to have it repaired, but as they arrive, their car stops. Things get much worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter), is not there (he has been murdered savagely by his pet dog Cujo, a gigantic St. Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) Soon , the dog has them trapped in his car and is trying to get everything inside the vehicle to destroy these two hapless victims. The climate is suffocatingly hot; not a living soul knows they are there; the car does not start and the dog really wants his blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a genuinely tense siege thriller, but it never really fits. I've read the book and it's quite disappointing, certainly for King, so it's not surprising that the movie version is so small. On the printed page, King at least could generate a certain degree of tension, but the film is hampered by the fact that a Saint Bernard simply does not give much fear. The "visuality" of the middle of the film serves as a constant reminder that Cujo IS a St. Bernard. In the book, it was possible to forget this. In the book, Cujo sometimes seemed to assume the appearance of a monster. Even with the relatively short execution time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a tedious and exhausting experience of patience, sometimes with no funny intention and no doubt as suspenseful as he would like to be. They have even omitted the cruel end of the book and replaced it with a conclusion of "all is well and ends well" so that the public can return home in a happy way! Chalk is like another adaptation of the Lower King.
