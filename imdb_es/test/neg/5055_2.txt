I heard that this movie was bad. They even warned me that it was terrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I still saw her when she appeared on national television. Watching movies by Kevin Williamson means torturing! Their scenarios are not fun, definitely not scary and are not the least creative. Teaching Ms. Tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as her brainless series 'Dawson's Creek' and probably also for the same target group. Before the credits began, 5 people already wanted a hug and declared that "I love you" in a mysterious way. There's nothing better because the soundtrack is full of annoying pop / rock and the story is ultra thin. Three students on the verge of graduation are trapped by the most perverse teacher in the school. Every high school has a teacher like that, you know? To save their skin, they try to convince Mrs. Tingle that it was not her intention to cheat, but this attempt goes awry. The typical humor of high school is completely lost to me, the overdose of feelings is pathetic and the acting (with the exception of Helen Mirren) is abominable. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act? Is that a fact proven by his role in 'The Gift'? but she urgently needs to stop accepting the roles of a disheveled girl. As said before, the only positive comments are those of Helen Mirren's brilliant casting as the shrew. It's like Kathleen Turner in 'Serial Mom'! The paper adapts perfectly to it and you can not imagine anyone else interpreting it. Apart from that, this is avoidable teenage nonsense.
