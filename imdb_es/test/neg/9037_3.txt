Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene in which Brian says he should stop traveling and that the other Boys call him a traitor. It did not happen that way, and as the movie indicates at the beginning, some scenes have reacted excessively. A movie about The Beach Boys does not have to be that way because, anyway, many things happened. The sad thing is that this movie offers a wrong image about the boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. The toughest fans like me knew that this is not the whole real story and that's why I gave it a low score of 3. However, it's the best movie about The Beach Boys that I've seen so far, which says a lot about the other movies If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony.
