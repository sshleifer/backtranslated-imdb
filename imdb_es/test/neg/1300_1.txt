It was inferred in a previous poster that the military would not be subordinated to the police in a disaster as shown in the film. In fact, the military function would be to provide assistance to civil authorities when requested. The civil authorities would maintain primacy. In practice, the Army would need approximately 48 hours to mobilize, since there is not much Army presence in London, especially with current commitments abroad. Even then, it would depend on calling the TA. <br /> <br /> As for COBRA, we got the impression that it was a complete government emergency department in its own right, including a reference to a Cobra Division of Met Police. . In fact, COBRA is synonymous with the Information Office of the Cabinet Office "A". It is only the room where the PM or DPM meet with their advisors to discuss the current emergency!
