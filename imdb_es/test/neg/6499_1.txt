Set in a post apocalyptic future, the new mountaineer is a small and effeminate twerp named Quentin MacLeod, who is being tutored by a new Ram√≠rez while his little sister joins him in his quest to thwart an evil immortal lord. To do so, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this supreme lord, Korton, does. <br /> <br /> In short, this is pure shit, much like the aftermath of the Highlanders. Quentin is a pretty stupid character, complaining and moaning constantly and complaining in a kind of "woe to me because I'm a reluctant hero", and he never realizes the fact that he is an immortal and can not be killed, at least not easily. Ramirez would have done better to get rid of him and frustrate Korton himself.
