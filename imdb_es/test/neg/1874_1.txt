You know, as he gets older, he somehow thinks that the movies he did not like when he was younger, could have been due to his youth and inexperience. For example, when I saw the Godfather at age 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and started to appreciate fantastic movies. <br /> <br /> So, last night, I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend for her request, since she loved it at age 14 and I hated her equally. years. But I was hoping, because I was young and stupid at 14, maybe this would be a new experience for me. So I sat with her to look, hoping to enlighten me. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I feel that someone got into my soul and stole 2 hours of my life to see this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old boy, but he looks like he's 35 years old. And the premise of the film is that he seduces a minor adolescent, courting her with his dance moves. Really scary. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is the plot of the clich√© where the boy from the "wrong side of the tracks" and the "rich and intelligent girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, her romance is driven by the fact that the "rich girl" can not dance, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the grand finale of the show on vacation, or something like that. . <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: the father who disapproves soon enters and forbids the two of them to see each other, and the film advances to secret meetings of dance and love lessons. All this culminates in the final scene, where the whole resort meets the two young lovers while the father, who was once antagonistic, accepts the 35-year-old dancer as the new man of his teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend moaned at the end of the movie, as she admitted, it was nothing she remembered. I did not press it, but I smiled a little and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player.
