If you are a Christian or a Jew who expects to see a precise Biblical representation (or Torah) of the events in Exodus, this film will disappoint you. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible have been "created" to support the characters and play an important role in the movie. Jethro's role has changed completely and he becomes nothing more than a distrustful father-in-law instead of a pastor priest who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely eliminated from the film, and instead viewers have the impression that Moses had to solve things for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic turn of biblical things and tries to put most of the responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what he should do. Those who know the book of Exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the film, but also evident changes in the events. The most important thing is that they will see an almost total absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines all that Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as the film describes it, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even Hallmark apparently can not recognize the direct role of God, and without his spoken words to Moses, many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has changed some things. For example, after the golden calf, God plagues people and they should look at the symbol of a snake to live. Hallmark creates a civil war in its place and the Israelites choose sides, then they kill each other. The side of Moses wins, of course. <br /> <br /> This film may have a minimum value for unbelievers, as it can make them look for answers, but believers should stay away. Events and twisted changes make this a danger for anyone who does not know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
