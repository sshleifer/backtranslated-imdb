This movie just does not work. There are not two ways to do it. I saw it for the first time in '98 when it was released and I did not like it. I just bought it for sale a couple of days ago, because I thought "what the hell, I'll try." I do not regret the money I put in for Hamilton, but the fact remains the same ... this movie does not make sense, it's boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The Stormare is usually a delight, but that's when it's making movies in the United States. At home he does not do the trick. Of course the film is well made (if you forget the strange footage here and there), but in the end the only thing that REALLY elevates Hamilton over the garbage of a star, it's Hamill's turn as Hawkins' bad guy. He has serious fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments of the movie. "Swedish intelligence, huh? Now there is a contradiction in the terms" and when it allows Hamilton to speak a word or two with his wife. The phone towards the end of the movie. And that is really enough. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
