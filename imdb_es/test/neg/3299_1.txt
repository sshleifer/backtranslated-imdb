I saw the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development", boy, I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this program was blatantly discarded from "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children" since they are all similar in plot and in general. The so-called "striking lines" are all repetitive and formulated, even more, those "striking lines" are not funny at all, for me, they are more in the line of being rude and raw. The main character, Dave Gold, acts like a white trash bully, who thinks he's being fun and cool, and he's not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the episode "Gaza Strip"). <br /> <br /> In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer (but in reality it was pretty bad), Dave and Vicky happily decided to crush their dreams by telling her that it stunk. After that, she wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, the two began to mock her without thinking. Also, in the first episode, Dave said about Hillary's (black) boyfriend: "Do you really think we're going to let him go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own piss," that line has to do with the dumbest line in the world. world. Television history. And Dave constantly mocks Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he is gay and that he is a geek. Also, do not forget that he also made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father who is supposed to defend his son no matter what. "The War at Home" is undoubtedly the worst TV show for the family. That clearly explains why the program should be canceled, since it spreads a racism and a homophobic agenda. It's as if the program wants to be funny for always putting that stupid road of laughter every time someone says something, but the lines are somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetically juvenile. <br /> <br /> Another reason the show is horrible is The acting, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. Rappaport always has to move his hands when he is in front of the camera, not only does this in this program, but he also did it during his time with "Boston Public". Sullivan speaks and acts like a kind of robot every time he acts (he also did it in "Malcolm in the Middle"). <br /> <br /> So to summarize all this, everyone has their reasons for what it is. wrong in this program 1. It's unoriginal 2.The performance stinks 3. It's not even funny 4. All the jokes are the same 5. It has bad writing 6. The characters are sad and unpleasant 7. The father is a scam Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX needs to get this trash out of the air, because everything is better than this.
