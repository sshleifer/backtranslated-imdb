Despite a handful of well executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the excellent MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splash film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the historical premise. <br /> <br /> A malefactor becomes obsessed with a conservative woman who appeared reluctantly in a porn photo shoot. Predictable harassment, harassment, assault and rape occur. <br /> <br /> The basics of Roman porn are sex. And sex mixes with violence. Both potentially exciting topics, of course, but not when so little effort is made to make them new. A masturbation scene in which a woman pushes her pencils up to open it (through the condom) is too little to twist her. <br /> <br /> The rainy motif of the series continues and the final scene of the film brings relief.
