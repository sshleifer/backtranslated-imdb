A spaceship in an unspecified future where humans are equipped for space travel and have laser weapons for weapons, land on a strange and young planet where dinosaurs also evolved and, only in this world, have not become extinct ... still. The survivors of the accident, approximately ten bland characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, struggle to survive against the alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "The planet of the dinosaurs" is a peculiar movie. As I said in my previous summary, animated dinosaurs moving in the movie are the only colorful actors. The models are crude, but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters represented by inexperienced actors and speaking lines of a script that must have been written during the night without a single revision. Obviously, most of the budget went to the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there is not enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters are just there to shout, run and mutter these verbal and poorly written discourses about survival. And, unfortunately, dinosaurs do not eat them enough. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Planet of the Dinosaurs" is not a movie I plan to see again. Some people will simply adore it for being so cheap and so poorly made. Sometimes, I enjoy movies like this. But this particular movie is too long, too boring and too exhausting for the mind.
