I just saw Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vista Film Festival held here in Dallas, and I must express my discontent. The opening legend tries to tell us that the film is a representation of the current invasion of the countries of South America (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by the oil companies of North America, and the negative effects, both economic as environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple and pleasant life while maintaining a banana farm. Immediately, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's stepsister. I will not go into details about this (and, to be honest, I do not think I'm ruining anything with this revision), another key point is that the company to which they distribute their bananas leaves them aside. to the budgetary demands in a poor economy. Therefore, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the film is that of the husband, between the rock and the difficult place, trying to preserve his livelihood. On the one hand, the oil company Reynolds basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling in his city (compromising his position with the community and the community). itself). On the other hand, he faces being dead, but on the side of his community, protesting the drilling. Given the length of this movie, it would have been enough time to explore the problems just described, but it just does not happen, and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this movie has won a couple of prizes so far, one per address and one audience prize. I'm not going to separate Esteban's address, it was not good enough or bad enough to be so passionate about writing something. The audience prize was at a film festival in Spain, and to get a prize from the audience, I would have to imagine that Spaniards simply dig soap operas. In fact, Central America and South America also dig soap operas, I know that. I guess Esteban tried to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what develops throughout this film, to the point that he leaves the entire oil company in the plot on his side, almost as if they had imagined Halfway through the making of this film it had become an exhausting task, since it seems that at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and the development of their character seriously compromised to make room for more scenes of sex and crying The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and you never find out who the hell it is. It's almost as if they cut their screen time just before taking it out of the movie altogether. From time to time, they play with the oil against the plot of the community, but in the best of cases they are digressions. What we see much more are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such an extent that the secondary plot of the oil company becomes unnecessary. It is almost as if it were a trick to legitimize a romantic drama (telenovela) by throwing a bit of political relevance. However, the film is so caught up in the romance that, ultimately, it does not know what to do with itself, resulting in such a studded ending that you're left wondering what you've been waiting for, or if there ever was something to start Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: cut the half sister or eliminate the oil company. It is obvious in which of the two they were more interested. Or, maybe if Caribe had been another hour, they could have solved it. In any case, I would have done well with a soap opera and I think that the issue of the oil companies that exploit foreign nations has a great need to be addressed by the film community. The Caribbean is both and none. These two angles could have worked together if they had been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running in circles and occupying almost twice the time needed at the expense of an oil plot that has barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. Best of all, the plot of romance is never solved. I would like to say that I would see this movie again to see what I missed, but I have the feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned, it would not matter if I saw the Caribbean ten times more. I've missed it because it's just not there.
