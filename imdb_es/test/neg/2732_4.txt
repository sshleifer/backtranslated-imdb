"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (1965, made for TV). The action is stock, the predictable suspense. Once you subtract the whole plot ripped from "The Core", basically the manned drilling machine, you end up with the plot of "Crack in the World". "Crack" was an excellent movie starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled to the crust and "drilled" with a nuclear device to provide a constant source of geothermal energy.
