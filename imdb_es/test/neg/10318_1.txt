I do not know how this DVD came to my collection; My wife suggested that it was one of these "3 for £ 20" deals at a High Street store. The thing is not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! Having invested heavily in it, I felt compelled to see it to the end, just to make sure it was equally bad at all times, and it did. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was horrible, the story The line was impenetrable (I still do not understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the work of the camera was disjointed and desperate, the performance was of wood (the dialogue did not help me). <br /> <br /> In fact, there were no redeeming features, no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, in whose brilliant subsequent career this pile of scum has probably been sold. You should ask your agent to buy all the rights and then bury it ASAP. <br /> <br /> As a last funny example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene in which the young leader talks to the father. The former army comrade while driving. This was the clearest dialogue in the movie, with no engine noise at all! I look forward to the engine damping technology that eventually makes its way across the pond to British cars!
