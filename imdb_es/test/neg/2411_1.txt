I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: the impressive HR Giger poster. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to discover that the film could not live up to the poster (Giger said that director Moore actually begged him to do so). When I saw this for the first time, at the age of 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I would still think that if I had not seen certain movies in MST3K since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has a group of annoying college students who enter the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader. his fraternity. That's when they met Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psychopath who kills the leader of the gang and blames the brothers as an excuse to hunt them down and take power. The rest of the film consists mainly of persecutions. A hand full of fraternities try to leave the mutant city (which I think is supposed to be LA, even though it was made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political things in that the society of boys in the fraternity are pro-nuclear weapons and the mutant society is anti-nuclear. It talks about how Splatter became a phenomenon due to radiation. Most people develop cancer due to radiation, but the splash simply triggers spikes and kills girls. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. At one point, our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two professional policemen, and she shows them "how the other half lives." It turns out that the other half are all punk children who dance around a bad pop band of the 80s. So our little epic is both mute and outdated. That is really all there is to be done. The boys of the fraternity that run through disordered buildings while the ones that look like motorcyclists try to kill them ... Oh, and it's the future. <br /> <br /> I do not think you have any doubt about why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. This thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, buy your books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just look at ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that nobody needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the image sound good, there is another horrible movie that does the same thing, only bigger and better: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. It sucks, but blows FUTURE KILL off the screen.
