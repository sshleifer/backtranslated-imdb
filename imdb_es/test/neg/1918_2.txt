Life is too short to be wasted in two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this, unless you're a carefree 16-year-old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do. Bored characters, bad acting (artificial emotion), weak story, slow pace and the most important thing about this film with a defective existence: nobody cares about the too dramatic relationship.
