There have been many movies, about living the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First of all, from the technical point of view, there are many mistakes. The audio is bad, I had trouble understanding the dialogues here and there, and the camera positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to create a good movie, but for example the part where Show, how Jonathan is getting lost in the dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, is very badly done. The acting is very bad also by all the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time seeing it from the beginning to the end, and I could not wait for the movie to end. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you are bored on a Sunday with bad weather, look at it. If you are in a deep story with action, then this is not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not have given a score of 1, but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio and the use of the camera, not to mention the bad scenes with cheesy effects.
