When I bought this film, I was hoping to get a fun 1970s exploitation film. Instead, I got this boring festival from amateur author Andy Milligan. Oh, Andy Milligan. With its tight editing, its dizzying pace and its wonderfully well-known actors, you'd almost think you're watching ... one of their home movies! Seriously, I could not even stay awake the first time I tried to see him. The scenes of boring people were prolonged and, whenever someone was killed, the film slowed down. Sometimes it also accelerated, making the voices of the characters sound like squirrels, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script actually seemed a bit better than the movie, and it seems more appropriate to be in a soap opera than in a granulated pill of the 70s, where the actors constantly stumble with their lines. The cover said "Your main cuts were curiously erotic ... but completely brutal!" Trust me, there is nothing "erotic" in this movie. Oh, we can see characters that resemble cottage cheese more, but that's it. And as for "brutal", well, the viewer is the most brutal with this movie here. And another thing...
