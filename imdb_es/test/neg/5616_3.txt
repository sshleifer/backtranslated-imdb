For my part, I really expected this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit high, but the fact is that I love Judd Nelson. In fact, it's the only reason why it's worth watching this movie and really its role is not so good. The highlights of this movie are boring sexual scenes and boring dialogue. If those are the highlights, I'm sure you have a good idea of ​​what kind of movie this is. There is definitely a reason why it was made for a television movie. Just see this if you have nothing better to do on a Friday night or just want to lose money on video rentals. Save time and rent The Breakfast Club!
