It's the only movie I almost got out of, and I would have it if my friends had not been with me at the movies. Normally, even if I do not like a movie, I think it's still worth reading until the end. In that way, you can really say that it has given you all the possibilities to redeem yourself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so terrible that I just wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. I think I probably would not have been so disappointed if this movie had been made by a minor director, one that I did not normally like so much. But coming from Wenders, it was much more shocking to watch. I know that Bono de U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the script for this abysmal movie, and I wonder why Wenders left him, as a friend of friends, as it could have been for both of them. "Stay with the work of the day, Bono," is a prayer that easily comes to mind when seeing this disaster. Pretentious, disjointed, a mixture of all the possible stereotypes of a contemporary film, a naive and transparent attempt to seem crazy and daring, with the most irritating characters I've seen, especially the protagonists, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, none of which I dislike normally. The happiest ending I could have wished would have been for a nuclear bomb to fall on their collective heads so that everything would end as soon as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the movie are extremely good, with a very moving soundtrack of U2. But the initial shots of the film make the rest of the film (which is submerged thereafter) even more disappointing, since they are a promise of cinematic quality that never delivers, does not even come close.
