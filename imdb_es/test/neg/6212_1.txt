This movie is widely recognized as a copy of Will Smith's characteristic Hitch. That movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as boring as it is unbearable. Govinda looks beyond her best moment. He is not at his best doing papers like this. He is equally unconvincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is facing his "best" eye pain. And that's in the few scenes where he remembers putting on his clothes. It could only have been through nepotism that the scenes of this eye pain could be saved from the garbage of the cut floor of any film. <br /> <br /> Another case of Bollywood is embarrassed with its blatant cloning. Another case of the majority of the Bollywood audience is embarrassed to make this a success.
