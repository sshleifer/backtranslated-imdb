The other night I saw this movie in Telly and little did I know what party it would be ... I knew it would be stupid, but not so bad! This film exemplifies everything that is horrible in the Australian comedy. Apart from the most boring and boring scenarios and characters I've ever known (apart from the dubious American tax comedies produced in the United States!), Most situations were boring, incredible, stereotyped and SO not so fun, just .. terrible! <br /> <br /> One of those scenarios that really bothered me was the nerds at the bus scene. From the perspective of writing the screen, the writers used the most disinterested, if not incredible, scenario to leave these three stranded without their luggage ... They are on vacation from their lives and they are going to risk everything (even $ 300 Deposit, luggage and room) to exercise your rights to dance on a bus? I mean, they're half an hour away from their destination! At least they could have made the bus driver throw them out, but no, they leave voluntarily because 'they can not take it anymore!' And they ruin your vacation ... Anyway, I can not believe that the writers did not treat this awful scenario out. I think a ten-year-old can come up with 5 more intelligent, fun and credible configurations. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others: the stereotyped psychopath really lacks imagination, the whole relationship with the angry fired. girlfriend and tag along the virgin, the 'Wow Man! Out there, the goth girl inhaling things on the train ... EVERYTHING was just regrettable! I can not think of a redeeming feature of this movie, except maybe the nerd on the third wheel was a little cute. However he ruined his career by appearing in this garbage!
