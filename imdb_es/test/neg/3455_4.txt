(Caution: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someday, somewhere, there will be a post-apocalyptic film made that does not stink. Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not that movie, although I have to give it credit for having tried it. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone who is credited only as "the mailman". He is not really a postman, just a vagabond with a mule in the desert of a Western America devastated by an unspecified catastrophe. He trades with isolated peoples performing Shakespeare. Suddenly, a group of bandits called the Holnists, the self-declared caudillos of the West, descend on a village that Costner is visiting, and his evil leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton), calls Costner. After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, ending a long section of the film that could have been better told in a three-minute flashback. <br /> <br /> Now we finally arrive at the biggest premise: the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under the pretext of being a mailman . Several of the people in the village led by the young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to participate in this act of a postman, who does not feel good with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself as the involuntary and involuntary leader of a band of postmen in war. with the Holnists. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it seems. The Holnists depend for their subsistence on the fact that the villages they feed on are isolated from each other; The Holnists can destroy any village, but they can not oppose all their united victims. To join, the villages must communicate with each other, and a working mail system would be a big step in putting the Holnists out of business. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem became medieval with our heroic carriers. Unfortunately, Bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages joining against him, but his old cliché of waiting, the one-on-one fight between him and Costner. There is not even a real attempt on the part of the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; All the mail seems to be the standard material of "Hello, Aunt Debbie" that is played with the maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies, shot by shot, I've ever seen. Now, I do not intend to purposely ruin the films for myself by striving to discover what will happen next. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that does not require effort; I only knew what was going to happen next, whether I wanted to know or not. After a lion is prominently displayed to people who eat, a holistic bandit searching for escaped Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and then we are surprised when the lion eats it. A firing squad arrests a group of harmless villagers, and one of the villagers sings some Famous Last Words just before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise. A covered statue is presented to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: Costner bends down to pick up a letter from a handsome boy we saw earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem that no, sir, you can not just take my wife; Bethlehem goes through the stunned unsuspecting, although he is the only person in the theater who does not suspect it. <br /> <br /> But it is sentimentality of rank, which really undoes POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, playing Costner's mistress, Abby, is worse served. She pours her heart into the material and does everything she can to make it look natural and sincere. She tries so hard, it's heartbreaking. But nobody could have made the lines "I have a gift for you, postman .... You give the hope that it's a candy in your pocket", sounds like anything other than porridge. Another example is the scene in which a mounted Costner thunders in front of a small child, ignoring his offered letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes and then thunder to pick up the letter. Why did Costner not pick it up the first time? There is no real reason; it is just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of euphoria destroying the child's hopes and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability come together at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed. I sat thinking, "Please, do not tell me they're going to show the statue and then they'll go to the scene with the kid, it's probably too saccharine, too obvious for this movie." Then, unfortunately, the music swelled and, in fact, we cut out the dreaded little boy who was smiling when his letter to his maid aunt was taken away, and I held my head in my hands and thought, "Someone shot me." It felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie stuffed in my throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Belén is a more humanized villain than usual. His standard post-apocalyptic villain is the S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is shown as a little nothing of a man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by hitting others. While the threat is sacrificed, Belén is credible in the way that most villains are not. Unfortunately, Will Patton overreacts. And although we were told from the beginning that Bethlehem completely destroyed her last opponent in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, the actual combat skills of Bethlehem that are shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The acting otherwise is pretty good. Costner has done better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. The score of James Newton Howard is competent, although it is below the epic standards that the film sought. But it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of ****.
