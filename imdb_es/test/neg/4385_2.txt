I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free nudity. So, why did not I like this movie? No movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not SE7EN, just make me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I never felt so frustrated watching American Pie movies or any other more modern National Lampoon movie. This movie has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what follows. Instead, I stop to think: "Why did you keep that scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you're waiting for Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I had when watching this movie was to guess what movies were the actors when they were children. 2/10 generously.
