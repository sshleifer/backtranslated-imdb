I can not believe I sat through this garbage. The palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a piece of corpse as a corpse so obviously artificial that I thought it was supposed to be a mannequin ... until it left a blood stain ... forced dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was so bad. Do not waste your time, I wish I had not done it. The only thing that saved was that it was on the cable, so I did not waste my money on everything.
