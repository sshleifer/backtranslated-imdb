This was one of the biggest garbage pieces I've had to see. Is seriously. How else would anyone feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even CONSIDERING that it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million dollars? After all, she was the one who talked about that in bed and said it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever it is with that money. Woody never fully accepted until she convinced him. How can you trust her? Who the hell would even consider it if they were married? I do not care how desperate they were. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then, he turns on her. Apparently, he had no right to distrust her, other than the fact that his wife had only slept with another guy who is extremely rich and handsome. Oh, and wait, then you're supposed to apologize to her after she files for a divorce so she can be with the guy she went to bed with. Of course, Woody has no right to say anything or distrust him, especially after he still has the Roy Hobb card in his wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she seems so in love with Woody and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he made a ridiculously stupid story to try to insinuate him to leave, and she bleeping thanks Hobbs ???? Are you kidding jokingly? Was she under contract as his sex slave or something? I mean the bleep ?? Oh and hope it gets better. She kisses him passionately kissing him before he gets out of the car. Yes, she is not a whore. Oh, thanks for letting me go, let me go out with you one last time for the love of God. Smooch smooch, smooch even though I'm still married to a man I left for a rich man. I've never seen a piece of shit in my life. How the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending? What was this film supposed to represent? NOTHING COMES OUT OF THIS! This was the most useless movie I've seen in my life. Two desperate and pathetic people. If I were Woody, I would tell him to drown in the body of water that was nearby. Apparently, he did not have self-esteem. What the hell was Roy Hobbs thinking when he took this horrible paper? I feel like throwing up after seeing this. This movie was so bad, it was seriously ridiculous. I want those two hours of my life that I wasted watching this piece of shit.
