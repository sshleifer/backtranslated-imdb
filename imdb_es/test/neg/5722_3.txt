Okay, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I only have one thing for 6 'tall women with swords. There I said it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost all the mistakes you can make were committed. You take a hit series of movies (Conan) and drag through the mud with a bad script, a bad cast, bad effects and worst of all ... you put a cute child there for comic relief. This kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series, you know. Cute children are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen at least took the film seriously, although it seems that nobody else did. The plot caused Schwarzenegger to repeatedly remove Red Sonja's grease from the fire and that considerably undermined his character. A warrior woman does not need a guy to get her out of a mess, that's her job! Not reusing Conan's character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh The film never set the right mood and its rhythm was quite disjointed and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian, who had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's fine to have cheesy costumes, it's fine to have harryhausen style animation, it's good to have silly exorbitant games that do not make sense, but having a horrible script is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a classic, but the script looked like it was written by a 12-year-old boy.
