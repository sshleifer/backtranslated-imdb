The only good thing about this movie is its final turn. In 97 minutes of film we can only save a single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie, I must say! For more than 90 minutes, this movie is just a collection of clich√©s, bad acting, stupid ideas and revelations, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; All this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot. until the last three minutes, where, FINALLY, a good idea appeared! It is nothing exceptional or an extremely original idea, but at least it was a good idea "decent", the only one that has the whole movie! I will not spoil it, but I must say that I think that idea with a better plot, better effects and, definitely, a better performance, would become a good movie. If you watch this movie and you support it until the end you will know what it is?
