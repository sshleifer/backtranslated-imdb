The moral of this program is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, poor posture, bad jobs, and so on. They are obviously miserable and they detest themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be rich, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of themselves for this flagrant exploitation of parents' fears and guilt. If nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a program using honest and truthful methods. If you really believed in your computer simulations, I would like to see you do a double-blind test, finding some 40-year-olds, discovering their eating and exercise habits as children and how they progressed with age. photos Then, compare with real things. Hey, that sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel: are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC must agree with Tabloid Lies and Cons.
