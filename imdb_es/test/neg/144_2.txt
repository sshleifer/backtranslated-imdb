Somehow I managed to do it throughout this movie, but I was stunned at the complete lack of entertainment delivered. My friends and I are fans of the HK movie, but WOW. This movie has it all, and with everything I want to say everything that a film should not have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, overdone, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, extravagant "jokes" and "jokes", primary school premise, senseless murders, and also - Time for prolonged execution for the material. Add in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie and this movie becomes even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you are considering the idea of ​​watching this movie ... do not do it.
