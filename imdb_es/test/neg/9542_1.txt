Wow - this movie was very bad! Do you talk about the plot of the typical movie, of the formula? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cold but failed. The twist of the plot at the end, where we discover who is the bad guy, was unexpected, but does not make much sense until his monologue. Even then ... The amount of blood in this movie does not help either. Are all these images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of the pieces of the film. Would the DP really send a lone officer to an unlighted warehouse, a subway tunnel, or anywhere to find a body, when the location of the perpetrators is unknown? And why did the romance in the end just happen suddenly? It's as if the writer tried to fit into every Hollywood clich√© he could. Do not waste your time watching this piece of ... something.
