Well, I've been to a British university, in fact I went to the same movie, and it was nothing like that. This is a horrible movie, badly made and acted. The worst thing is that it could have been really good, if you bothered to spend more than 12 pence, in fact, if you really wanted to represent the real British students, you should act like one and get a loan of 15,000 pounds. It does not say anything about Uni's life, where was diving in the jungle, drinking tea until 4 in the morning, endless talks about group dynamics? Where was the diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just being romantic, but I do not remember that Fresher's Week was so horrible, and I'm total. And in the end the question remains ... a bed or a closet?
