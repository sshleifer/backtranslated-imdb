Deanna Troi naked! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother, Chuck (from "Happy Days") with an inverse Mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including a clever scene in which the character of Chuck Bronson installs a device similar to a mousetrap that causes the brain to approach a punk when open the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also places a table with a pile of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody prints on his head. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've seen in my life: loaded to the brim with chaos, and almost no response from the police, despite use of military weapons to cut the punks by the score. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, Bronson rejected this movie, but he happily cashed the Golan Globus check. <br /> <br /> If you like quality films, avoid this one, but if you fancy a cheap "Jackass" emotion, take a look.
