This show was hurried and relied heavily on surprise cuts from commercials (when it came back from the commercial, the noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse). This is a pure robbery of ghost hunters and tries to go "Beyond" them, and fails miserably. Also, what about the registration of directors? Is this star trek? It simply ruins the novelty of this show, which quickly disappeared. The only reason why it has been observed is that people want to laugh at the purely anti-climatic nature. They never find anything, and most likely never will. Interestingly, they always point out something that is what they are "hunting" and guess what? The tower light of the local radio station is blinking red!
