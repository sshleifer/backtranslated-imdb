I just saw Today you die. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) The direction and the editing are terrible, just horrible. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he's doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes do not make any sense. Also, I hate when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes horrible. I like the fact that they wanted to make the character of Seagal and Treach appear to be in a relationship similar to Lethal Weapon's characters, but it did not work simply because some of the dialogues did not have a sense, and I speak very good English, not is that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and the lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the film has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the movie? DO NOT. Seagal eliminates a lot of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having met them in the movie. STUPID. History sometimes deviates and the jumps recede without any reason. History is messy and useless at times. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some of the action scenes it's not Seagal, it's your double. You can say because they only film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats guys with martial arts movies, not real like the aikido that Steven knows. The double trick uses kicks and cheesy punches. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are spoken with your real voice. The rest is dubbing but it's not that bad. This was good It also seems that Steven is having fun in the movie and is more interested in the action in which he was in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; At least it does not seem to displease him. In addition, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but with the same clothes he's wearing on the DVD cover it looks more than good and he should have worn those clothes for most of the movie, not the stupid long leather coat . br /> <br /> I really think that Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he arrived late and took off early from the set IN TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy does not strike me as a coincidence. I think he realized that the crew was amateur or he was only in it for a quick money and he did not care about anything anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew, this could have been a damn good idea. Action movie for Seagal. Something like it was for justice or above the law. I honestly believe that. But the people who made the movie are not very good at their job or they did not have enough money to do the job correctly. Too bad, because I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was great too (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, at least this gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows from the past. I think the mercenary could be so badly managed. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same state of mind in which he was doing his best movies and at least ESA is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been SO much better. 4/10
