If you are like me and watched the original "Benji" phenomenon from afar, you finally saw the movie for the first time more than 30 years later, you may be surprised to discover how truly horrible it is and more bewildered than ever about its popularity. in 1974. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not entirely objective, since I tend to have a favorable bias towards children's films and, for that reason, it prevented them from considerable slackness. On the other hand, I have always hated this particular dog, a characteristic of the last two seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a great show, the early episodes without dogs were at least a good showcase for beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut their time on screen. <br /> <br /> Benji is a 86-minute mega dose of The Dog, following it on several daily circuits through the city of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring, it is recommended that you give "Benji" a large birth and never let your remote control fall into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there is still one). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because of Winn-Dixie", the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. Peter Breck of "Big Valley" plays the standard stern father and seems embarrassed by the idea of ​​appearing in something so bad. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to be finding "Benji" entertained, you should consider reducing your medication. <br /> <br /> Then, again, what should I know? ? I'm just a boy
