This film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject, elaborate 25 minutes of substantive material and extend it to a boredom of six hours that resembles the way a documentary could have if Fox's news decided to make one. Not even the participants in this so stubbornly obstinate film can hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few wonderful moments in the history of the world where people take a position and work to make a better world. If only the creators had talked to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they could have come up with something slightly smart instead of this cure for insomnia.
