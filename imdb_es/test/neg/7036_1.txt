One of the worst movies I've seen in my life, but extremely funny (although not on purpose). Each scene that contains something to do with; Airplanes, romance, script or acting are very bad. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all the pilots, it's so bad that it should burst out laughing at some point in the movie (see also Airport 79). : the Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Someone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except fans of the B movies, of course) <br /> <br /> enjoy
