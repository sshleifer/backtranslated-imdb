If I did not know better, I would think that the resurrection was made in the late 80's and early 90's, when it was sold like shit in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He talks as if he is reading the cards and becomes a source every time he has to. It was easily the weakest aspect of the movie. The other actors were fine, nothing horrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where the majority of the budget went: special effects. The murders seem quite professional, but they hardly compensate for the boredom of the film. <br /> <br /> I would not go so far as to say that Resurrection is a carbon copy of Se7en, but it certainly has a certain resemblance. . Focusing on a religious-minded assassin in a modern crusade, detectives investigating their work have to rely on passages from the Bible and Christian history to put together the killer's puzzle. However, the resurrection is devoid of the intelligent narrative, cinematography, acting ... well, everything that makes it good. Instead, Resurrection lies to the audience and uses the mystery method of Scooby Doo to surprise him. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Resurrection was as bad as I expected. I almost feel bad for criticizing this movie because I knew it was going to be bad, but ... sue me.
