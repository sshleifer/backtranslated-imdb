OUCH, there's no real need to say anything else. This movie actually had me contemplating suicide. As a big fan of the wonderful genre that are zombie movies, I think this is possibly the worst attempt I've had in secret. The movie never really seemed to go anywhere! What was the point of all this? I feel desperate and lost. Hell, this was so bad that I can not even justify hitting him anymore. I'm just going to hang myself in the closet. OK now I tried to send my comment but the server will only accept comments of ten lines or more. So here goes ... Bad, horrible, there's not enough blood. NO TITS !!! How can you have a Zombie movie without tits. In fact, the female lead had a large number of frames and the only reason I saw the finished movie was so that, by chance, I could take a look. NOPE! Of course, there was a line that deserves to be mentioned, a line that I hope I can use someday (when I feel the need to hit my face) "This pig is not going to smoke alone" This movie is bad, very bad.
