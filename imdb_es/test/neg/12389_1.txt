I find it disconcerting that in an era in which satisfying and satisfying spirituality is unknown and that we are all scattered throughout the spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and a fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, is exceptional - it can not be denied that he had a special gift, it is a pity that he has misused it, however, due to the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unsuspecting sheep that were at his beck and heard and admired, can inspire adherence and credulity This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's largely fictional and fantastic account of his training and "awakening" (which he would prefer to describe as his discovery of how much he could influence the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people Look at it, if you dare to have an unpleasant revelation about how sadly we are deprived s of the true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff can inspire such devotion, and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine handy if you are one of those who still expect a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography at the service of the premises and pretensions of a dysfunctional cult.
