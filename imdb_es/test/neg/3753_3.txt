Let's face it, this is a pretty bad movie. However, if you're ready to make fun of her, you can survive the experience. Well, you will scream a lot in the agony. The fun of the African jungle is a kind of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Tom Conway (who spends most of the movie with an extravagant text) is using the local witch doctor and crazy science to create a "perfect" being. It looks like a varmint that has been in a week. Drunk and is in a baggy dress. The bad thing is to be kind. But he will not kill for him because he is using a good girl as his subject. You need a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two small thieves in search of African gold. The acting lessons for Ms English should have been at the top of the search list. She is a bad girl and she tells everyone in a performance worthy of a high school work. Mike "Touch" Connors is the white guide of English & Fuller with leading the expedition. <br /> <br /> English & Conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell. She is the perfect subject to b Ecome her voodoo creature because she will do anything (will emphasize anything) to get what she wants. You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting to me Conway was wearing that tribal hat / headdress / funky flower piece! I was still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was. I suppose he thought that if he lowered it enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him. <br /> <br /> Really bad cinema.
