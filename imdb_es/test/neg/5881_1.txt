This movie is terrible. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a sufficiently promising basis for a plot, in fact, the film does not advance beyond this premise. While there are some (good and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laborious, trite and, ultimately, boring without thinking. This is despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (client / interest of Hammer) have a considerable presence on the screen. Despite being portrayed for what might be described as an exaggerated joke, this film is consistently middle class middle class off the road. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (note- the music was good ..!)
