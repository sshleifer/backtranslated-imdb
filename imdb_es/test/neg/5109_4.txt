From the brilliant mind that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruise." "The uproar" is, unfortunately, more similar to the latter. It's a messy movie in general that has a great vibe made for television. The entire film is based on the question: "What if 'Boy Next Door' was a serial killer?" but instead, it ends up being a drama and a meditation without inspiration in the plea of ​​madness and the death penalty that makes little sense. The film is based very freely in the case of Richard Trenton Chase, selecting some data here and there to make a false character and a different result. One of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a head-first child and ending the life of a murderer is, in a way, analogous. "Sometimes you just have to choose," says the main character. Yes, sometimes you have to choose to disconnect ... on your TV!
