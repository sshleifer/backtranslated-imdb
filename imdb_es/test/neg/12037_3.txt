Some movies that you see and say: "Well, that does not make sense". And you really do not mean it. He's just saying that things were too complicated or a bit absurd. <br /> <br /> "Bread And Circus" does not make any sense at all. And I'm serious. And that's not because it's surreal. From the beginning, it is quite clear that it is a weak excuse to make special splash effects. There is no script. There is no plot. There is no history of any kind. One event does not lead to the next: bad writing is so fundamental. <br /> <br /> And what? I mean, there are TONS of movies out there that fall into that category. They want to show you gore, they give you gore. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because, in this case, "Bread and Circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, on the floor - people coming out of them. The earth, in space, two legs on each side. These types of images are wonderful, funny, strange, crazy. But the movie does not do anything with them. <br /> <br /> Things happen, the movie ends, and everything is very unsatisfactory. I suspect that the script was made on the fly. Too. If there had been a story of ANY kind, it would have become a much more entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The movie looks a lot like the beautiful car you'd love to have. Then you raise the hood and there is no engine. Only a small man selling a bicycle. <br /> <br /> GRR!
