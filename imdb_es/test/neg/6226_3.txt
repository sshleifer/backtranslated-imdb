This is a new approach to comedy. It's not fun <br /> <br /> The joke is that this, in itself, is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French story, located In Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The film is also starring the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters behave like in those Carry-On movies of previous years. <br /> <br /> I think these are also jokes: throwing these actors who do not try to act in French in any way. , to have fun in the manner of the comedy of the large English ballroom, and to leave all the mystery of Bloomin without explanation to the public. <br /> <br /> In the humor department, this is practically the Algonquin Round Table. It is not like this? <br /> <br /> The movie tries to be charming and quirky, and I think these features are quite funny. Not as fun as Duck Soup or Love and Death, maybe, but more fun than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It is an example of personal cinema. He does not make any real effort to approach and share with the audience, but remains true to his premise and internal logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical within the bizarre world of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I like this kind of eccentric movie, but it seems to me that it is too slow and boring. , tedious, and to provide very few pleasant surprises or genuine ingenuity. It's just kind of meandering in predictable and sophisticated ways, and wasting some wonderful talents along the way. It has to be the lowest point in the career of each of the main stars, who are distinguished players. I discovered that it was the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing. <br /> <br /> So, rate him as an interesting young lady, and pass it on as a Rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill. <br /> <br />
