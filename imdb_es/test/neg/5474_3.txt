The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the hidden and obsessed horror scene of the 70s shortly before Halloween, broke the rules book, set it on fire and kicked it through a window of glass. br /> <br /> To summarize a long story, a couple of entrepreneurial Greek entrepreneurs love their chances of finding a new film franchise that presents the unlikely double act of womanization, the wise American researcher Milo and the loving but kind priest of heart Father Roche. An exiled nobleman gets confused in a satanic pizzeria, offering tourists sacrifices to an extremely terrifying effigy of the minotaur, and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> However, reality is terribly boring, frustrating and full of wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the budding filmmakers exploited most of the budget to attract Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) on board and I hope that is enough to attract audiences in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> It is not. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with safe, camera and fantastic places. Eno's score, though basically just a chord drone that he probably released in an afternoon, is appropriately atmospheric and the film is loaded with crunches from the 70s, including the Austrailian genre of Fawlty Towers and the super sexy Jane Lyle of the island of the infamy of death. But that's where the positive aspects end. Strolling along the walks to sleep, she seems to have an ear of corn on her butt and Pleasance cares about doing the best she can, but is never doing things right. To make matters worse, Milo's character is terribly fragile and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Well, then it does not look so good. But from there the movie simply refuses to go anywhere. There is a hint that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never do anything but shuffle the glassy-eyed look. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you are sure that things will reach a critical point, Milo and Roche will interrupt the baron's satanic party with an easy laugh, and send him to meet his creator. The statue of the minotaur is silent and ready! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, to the right. <br /> <br /> The foolish optimism that The Devil's Men may be the first of a series of films is affected by the final line of Father Roche, just a few seconds before The end ridiculously hurried. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can ask him again to help defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll make that call any day, now Donald.
