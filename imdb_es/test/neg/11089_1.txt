Very strange, this seems a very normal movie, if not a little less. It's brilliantly filmed, but, along with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's the only redeeming aspect that I found in the film that consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part covers basic marine training which, when seen in 2007, is presented as something I have seen thousands of times before in dozens of other films and series, and it is not particularly exciting. After 30 minutes I had the idea and wished they could go ahead with it. The drill sergeant is the only credible character, while all the others seem to be just cardboard cutouts. The overall performance is staggeringly emaciated and the script is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant's screams. The boys achieve their training and finish in Vietnam. Oh, and the weird fat guy shoots the sergeant (what a surprise ...), probably in the mistaken belief that he was actually the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Then, an hour passed and nothing remarkable happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the part of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> It opens with a scene of bunks where the Stars and Stripes reporters are bored and are making small talks to pass. time. At first I thought they were recreating some scenes from old movie movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they were actually muttering their script lines. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 Vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. Pity for them, they are thrown like flies because they simply enter several manned weapons positions without means of coverage. Is that the normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, why did the United States not win this war during the first two months of commitment? The rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole plot does not make any sense. None of the characters inspires much sympathy and the story is frankly quite calm. It shows more than some war reporters who join a platoon with some guys who get shot because they are disobedient idiots and who also seem to think that somehow a hole in the wall will protect them from the bullets. <br /> <What was the message of this movie ... that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in situations of war? That if you want to get rid of really silly people, you send them to a war zone? Or that in some way in Vietnam concrete can really burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
