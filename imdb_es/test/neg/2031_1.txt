Somewhere in the US UU., The young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter that Bob would send her and the group cowardly Bob and Mic who kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels sorry and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I think "The Wind" is the worst movie I've seen in my life. The horrible script is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no story or plot, only sequences of scenes disconnected. The direction and performance of the fans are incredibly poor and terrible. It's amazing how the producers invest money in that garbage, the distributors throw this garbage all over the world and the viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this movie could be and it impressed me, as it is worse than I could imagine in my lower expectations. In the end, I wonder why IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, since trash really deserves this vote. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
