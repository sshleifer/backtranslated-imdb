This movie is very disappointing for someone who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean piracy story in the Caribbean, and he would have made a big motion. Also, it would have been very simple to do. All the action takes place on board a ship and on a desert island. Unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from Sabatini and then threw the rest of the book. He even changed the name of the main character, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel. It is a sad loss for those who love a good marine history.
