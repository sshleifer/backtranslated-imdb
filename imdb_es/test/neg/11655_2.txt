I'm not surprised that this movie has gone well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a superficial film that would attract shallow people well. Two actors that pretend to be actors in a relationship that fight and look for a lost dog. The film is supposedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is too small to merit such exploration. This couple has a dimension: they fight, they joke, then they make love and they fight a little more. There is a brief moment of tenderness that reveals no possible reason why these two are involved with each other because of their poisonous and volatile relationship. Very well filmed, excellent score, but without any merit in the script or the characters, this short is just that.
