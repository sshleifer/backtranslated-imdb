sorry for my spelling This is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed. Think bad dead * 1000. The acting is horrible, you can see the makeup line on a certain lady's face. There is a lesbian scene, which does not make any sense at all. And the end, haha, ohhhh, the end ... get ready to have your stomach hurt by laughter. Now, if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and still expect something, take a look and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad movie, to laugh and enjoy for its simple stupidity. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to see all the shots after the movie, you can see how low the budget really is. I was. In general, this movie is a rare gem in the demonstration of the lack of talent / care / skill / money / purebred and anything else you would need to make a successful movie. But it's definitely worth seeing.
