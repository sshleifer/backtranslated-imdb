Occasionally fun but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welcome back Carter (also known as Epstein) as the famous former criminal. There is a slap in the knee, a scene that destroys the gut and the French lady has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed but only have minor roles. You never know the characters and it's hard to worry about what happens to them. Not recommended.
