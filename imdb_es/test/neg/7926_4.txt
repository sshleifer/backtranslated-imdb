My first impression of the trailer for the movie Saikano: Live Action (which can be seen on YouTube) was "Wow, this could be one of the few best adaptations of live action anime." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! In short, Saikano's live action movie was a puzzle in which several pieces were missing; Gather enough to get the vague image of all this. <br /> <br /> * HISTORY * <br /> <br /> The history of the movies follows vaguely the anime and the manga, but the story of the films is just a picture of a car, instead of a complete automobile. It seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left aside, altered or completely changed. In fact, the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings. <br /> <br /> Characters especially; Many left out or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to Shuji knowing her because she is the lady of the video store. The character of Chise already felt too strong and only pronounced the infamous I'm sorry several times in the movie. The same can be said of Shuji. We lost the timid rudder but high masculine protagonist, the song that sounds, and his frequent action of calling Chise a fool. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had a different, attenuated sensation. Perhaps the fall and attenuation of other characters was to focus much more on Chise and Shuji, and so it was. Too. Do you expect many sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? Well do not do Those in the trailer plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you'll get. Much of the movie is talking about that while I was browsing through the movie before seeing it, I thought I had had a regular Asian romance drama. <br /> <br /> The stimulation was too fast. In the film, we see the famous Chise scene armed with small wings and a chain weapon, in just under nine minutes of starting it. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they should have done was divide it into two films, or even a trilogy. If there had not been so many things, they would have to be changed or dropped. <br /> <br /> But, again, the movie behaves like a frame. The anime was more of a complete car because even if all those little details and such are minor, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> -Visuals - The visuals were disappointing. A lot of the special effects turned out to be pretty cheesy, especially the CGI. Unfortunately, they were like those found in science fiction channel movies. They are bearable and this movie is not for the purposes. <br /> <br /> -Music- The music was normal. Much of it was orchestral background music, except that there really were no songs. The movie has dropped the addictive song that Shuji in the anime was always humming. However, a remarkable piece of music is the final song, which is heard in the trailer. It is not a bad song and something beautiful. It's a shame that it has not been integrated into the film as if it were an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> -Castro- The casting of Saikano was also regular. The main star was Chises actor Aki Maeda, who is most famous for his role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was quite good, but they removed the glasses to the original character. Oh, yes, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine the third. <br /> <br /> Unlike what I've heard from some others, Saikano's live action performance was not so bad. Rather, I feel guilty about the way the story was designed and the series became a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from the live Saikano action: * <br /> <br /> - CGI- I really wish the CGI in Saikano would not have been so bad. But even with that, we could have gotten some more fight scenes! Probably the most anticipated live action anime adaptation, Neon Genesis Evangelion, probably does not suffer, since they currently have WETA studies assigned to make the effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for his birthday. Why? This movie is made in 2006! Not only in the reality of the cinema can they create a thing like Chise so that it can not take place in the 90's! The future is an era of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully in Evangelion, Shinji has a Sony Walkman MP3 player. NOT one that plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Style and rhythm- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie moved too fast and forced the story to abandon many details. It was an intelligent movement about ADV Films and whoever it is, to turn Evangelion into a solid trilogy, thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave most Character Designs alone and let those classic quotes be told! What would happen if the live action Evangelion did not have Asuka's "What are you, stupid?" or Shinji: "I must not run!" Sometimes, as small as they seem, those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> In general, the real action movie of Saikano had potential. He really did it. Those who are not fans and see this movie: will be reluctant to start the anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) People who saw and liked the anime / manga, do not have any illusions in this case. Studies show that you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see the anime come alive in the live action adaptation, but it could have been much more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I give the action live Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) a 2 out of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br / > <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
