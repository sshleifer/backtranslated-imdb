This is a family film set in rural America in the 1950s about a boy whose uncle presses sheep to kill his dog Drum, initiating not only a legal family dispute but also the discord of the community when his city begins to take sides. This is a formula film that tries to be very moving and sweet. His biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (defense attorney), Ron Perlman (father / drum owner) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair," like the uncle and his wife, were fine). The kids were not that good (basically they seemed to be acting) and that's a problem when the movie really revolves around them (Aaron Fors, who plays the stalker Donny, makes me think about what actor Russell Crowe must have looked like child, only he has no talent, but a lot of ham). <br /> <br /> Favorite line (pronounced by the prosecutor after the closing speech of Scott Bakula's defense): "We will be lucky if they do not lynch us". <br /> <br /> The favorite line pronounced by Ron Perlman (after his son hits the aggressor): "Now is his difficult part." <br /> <br /> Nice enough to rent / buy used.
