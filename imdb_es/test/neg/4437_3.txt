The best thing I can say about "Quintet" is that it is not as bad as I remembered it when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it's good. <br /> <br This strange science fiction thriller is unlike any other movie I've seen, and I think it at least gives it the stamp of novelty. But it is the borderline disaster of a movie, and one of the worst that Robert Altman has ever done. In the special feature of the DVD about the creation of "Quintet", it is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell the movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> It is set in a distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot at the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo '67, and I must admit that this gives the film some interesting production design elements, even if it looks like it's being filmed in an ice-covered mall. Paul Newman, who seems to be lost and absolutely disinterested in what is happening around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play adrift who roam this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon, Newman is caught in a deadly game of "Quintet", which all boring inhabitants play for lack of something better to do, and the rules of which are never explained to the public. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill everyone else you play with and to remain the only person alive. This gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only emotion, because as one of them says at a point in a psychobabble soliloquy, only by being close to death can you appreciate being alive. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch because of its implacable sadness. It's almost as if Altman deliberately set out to make a movie that no one would want to sit on. There are no characters, of course, the actors are out there talking, but none of the lines really mean much and the impressive list of international actors that Altman gathered for this record is not an apex. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as it could be in a movie like this. But, nevertheless, he manages to establish an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is one of pure piety, and it is curiously fascinating in the way that watching a man die slowly from starvation to himself would be fascinating. <br /> <br /> Altman really reached a dry period after almost a decade of excellent movies. "Quinteto" closely followed the atrocious "A Wedding" and was followed in a short time by "A Couple Perfect", which is not bad but that can mostly forget, "terrible health". seen because it is not available anywhere to see) and the disastrous "Popeye". Thank God it bounced. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
