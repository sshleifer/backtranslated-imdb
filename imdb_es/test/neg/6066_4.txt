I am the only person who saw and remembers Amadeus. Each scene in "Copiando" has its counterpart in the Milos Forman, Amadeus, from the galloping carriages accompanied by frantic chains, to the entrance of Anna through the dark corridor preceded by the man with the key, until the very dialogue of the conclusion with Anna at the feet of Beethoven a la Salieri before the dying Mozart. Nobody else remembers the dialogue in that script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "Common Time". ..... "We started with the ropes ..." and thus "copied". <br /> <br /> Remember Cynthia Nixon leaning on a door jamb, with tears falling down her freckled face - the same scene, just replace her with Beethoven's nephew. Even the eschatological humor (fart jokes) is the same. We even have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet cookies that reminds Salieri in the banquet hall. Does anyone else remember? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna shouts at God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And beyond all that we have a youth script with an opening exhibition that reads like the identifications of characters that you will find in a children's story. "I'm Mr. Beethoven, I'm the composer ..." <br /> <br /> And what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? Apart from juxtaposing the technical versus the artistic ... a comparison that is not developed at all, probably because it does not make sense, especially when it comes to Beethove, who was a master of the technique. <br /> <br /> There is only one big scene: the one in the ninth. First, the music, which in itself brings you to tears. But then there is the highly erotic interaction of Anna, the copyist who keeps Beethoven's time and direction, which overcomes the most explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But, please, the rest of the movie, where is the collective memory of the world? You've seen all this before ... and better!
