According to "Lucien Rebatet" in his "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338), Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had a large number of "Platonic Passions" with female members of the "Vienna Aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". But the musicians, even the composers, did not qualify for the "Fine Ladies" Husbands. Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died because of drinking or Poison and Bethoven was, according to Rebatet, a frequent client of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. Newman, a British biographer, says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before he turned 40. That he became deaf is possible, but not sure. <br /> <br /> The Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824 at the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the Overture of the Consecration of the House and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the composer's first appearance on stage in twelve years; the room was full. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf at the Kapellmeister theater, Beethoven shared the stage with him in silence. <br /> <br /> So, what's left of this "feminine fantasy". The interpretation and characterization of Ed Harris are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting date of Ferninand Waldmüller of 1823. I have it in front of me. It shows a man who despises (perhaps hates) the world. With good reason.
