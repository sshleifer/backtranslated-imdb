If this film is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be necessary to create a new classification system, since it should not qualify. The plot of the film (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former agent of special agents who is being attacked by the brother of a man he murdered while still working for the government of the United States . If this sounds like an interesting scenario, do not be fooled, as this movie will not present what its action story suggests. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when you see an actor perform. a bad movie that makes one want to send the actor $ 50, since the actor must be desperate to get money to do a job of such poor quality. After watching this movie, you may want to send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run throughout the city of Los Angeles to protect his "honeycomb" (wife) from being killed by the brother of a man he previously killed. However, throughout the picture it seems that Baldwin can barely start with a slight trot. His relaxed performance manages to subtract from any suspense that the film could have tried to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who enjoys watching very bad movies and laughing at their shortcomings, this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well done action thriller, it would be better to look elsewhere instead of renting this movie.
