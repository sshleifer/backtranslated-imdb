Not really, I'm not kidding around here friends, and I can not believe how many people here have given them really positive reviews! Oh, wait, it's the comments section of IMDB, silly. It is interesting to note that on this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating of ten, however, there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. What does this mean, I wonder? Anyway, the script is terrible. The characters change their personality, motivation and actions in each scene, in order to keep the film moving to something that vaguely resembled a rhythm. It was not even silly behavior, but it was also present, but the sheer idiocy of the script transcended any foolishness shown by the characters. For example: Karl is disobeying an order because there are two corpses in the desert and "the murderer is somewhere", forcing everyone to travel 40 km to find the murderer, disobey orders and dispatch everyone. When the hero sees something unpleasant in the dark and warns Karl, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing out there, so everyone goes home. In the next scene, he refuses to let it go and must hunt anything. It's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but the shit that humans say about it just tries to cancel out its interesting aspects, and the moments of detachment from the predators and aliens were very tedious. and the end ... the end!?!?! Jesus ... the worst movie I saw in the year, and I saw the insect destroyer!
