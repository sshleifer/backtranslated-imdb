POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not a terribly objective critique, but I just found this film horribly depressing. Like most of Russell T. Davies' work, he asks more questions than he can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) delights in hope against odds and perseverance even after an apparent defeat. These edifying themes seemed strangely absent here. I guess the fact that I'm still thinking about it a few days after seeing it is a testament to the quality of the program, but the resolution was too bleak for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I would disagree with the comments I have read complaining that the end feels "stuck". I believe that each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the end represented a solid personal belief that carefully resolved the main theme of the program. While I never really questioned the progression of events, I felt that there was much that could have expanded. I also read that it was originally conceived as a series of four parts instead of two, and it is possible that truncation has done some damage to the finished part. However, these flaws appear everywhere, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched. <br /> <br /> To your credit, Davies is not afraid to write big, and you have to admire the audacity and scope of this project. The premise that deals here is the matter of movies or novels? It is a brave and ambitious thing to address it in the television medium. The strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric at the top. For me, he was and still is the best reason to look. The representation of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and attractive, and a true merit for both Davies' writing and Eccleston's performance. I also thought that the description of the reaction of the modern world to the second coming was true. <br /> <br /> So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be elevated or, at least, distracted by my fiction. I have a great real world around me. As filtered through CNN or the newspapers, if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons for judging this piece, but I am afraid that my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.
