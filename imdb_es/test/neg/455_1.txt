According to published reports (Variety), the program obtained the worst ratings in the history of the ABC television network. <br /> <br /> And I quote: ABC's musical talent competition "The One" opened on Tuesday night to cancel me. now classifications. <br /> <br /> The article went on to say that the program received a "surprisingly low score of 3/3 in adults 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers in general". <br /> <br /> That makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also under all the series in ABC's history. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the commercials, I knew I was going to fail. We do not need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a fair chance to succeed.
