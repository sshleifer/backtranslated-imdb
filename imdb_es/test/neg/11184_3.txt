The price of a dream, and some dreams can be "too" expensive. <br /> <br /> Only having seen the translated version in English, is perhaps the reason for a low rating of this viewer. <br /> <br /> It made the movie in general poorer than the story material hinted at ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments seem to suggest that the subtitled version would be better . <br /> <br /> But some elements of the plot were left without explanation, leaving an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> It also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?". <br /> <br /> Too bad there was no more (At this stage at least, anyway).
