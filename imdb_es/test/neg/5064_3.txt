I have to admit that I chose this film only for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were, as usual, great performers, the rest of the film was a disappointment. It feels like it's been created by a team of teenagers with low-level scripts, that is, scripts that lack depth, frightening photography and editing, and a hilariously funny score. I can not believe that I could see this seemingly long film until the end ... the sad thing is that this could have been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a success; that is to say, there are two main ingredients: a great history of national conspiracies and a great central distribution (although many other actors are practically of the quality of a telenovela). But maybe I'm missing something; Until then it is still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
