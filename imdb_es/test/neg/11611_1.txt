I'm not being funny at all when I say that this movie was worse than any other movie that was made. Worse than "Batman and Robin". Worse than "Hands, Hands of Destiny". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is terrible, I use the "Two Girls" scale to discover it. If the movie is comparable to "Two Girls", then I will not see it. If it's twice as good, maybe I'll see it, but only to laugh at the delays they paid someone to do it, because a movie twice as good would be junk.
