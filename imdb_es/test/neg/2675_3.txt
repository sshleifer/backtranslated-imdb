If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for fans of the series, then Halloween 6 is like a cruel insult. The story has gone to all the dogs. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this movie and does not give him any fear. It reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man who boogey man who frightened our hearts in the original. There are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and I am very happy that the H20 came out because it would be an insult for the fans to have this fresh in our minds. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was a nice touch and linked him to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to finish a career that would otherwise be nice). When it's on the screen, it reminds you of the old days when Halloween was really scary. <br /> <br /> That's it, my friends. The stem sequences are not original. One of them is a flagrant theft of the pursuit of Laurie / Michael in the original. The other characters are terribly poorly written and simply not nice. The music, in one of the highlights of Halloween, even when the movie is bad, is tortured in this movie. we get a silly rock version of the stalking / chasing theme. What were you thinking when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> His biggest mistake was killing Jamie's character (now played by another actress who is not worth mentioning) We saw this character escape death in two movies We are encouraged by her and when we kill her in this movie you can not help but feel sorry for her and realize that filmmakers do not care when good characters are set in a movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less said about this shame, the better. I wish it did not exist. I suggest you skip this movie, and even 5, and go directly to the H20 because if you see it, you may not want to see another Halloween movie again.
