I do not understand why someone would waste their time or their money in the trash like this ... Do not get me wrong: I LOVE a good Western. Notice that I said "OK": this is just trash <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible: Val Kilmer must meet someone or owe a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of trash ... <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoyed this movie, I'm making a list of your names to make sure I do not see anything that you suggest; Our tastes are definitely different, however, it is your right to express your opinion, no matter how far you are. It is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 in case they throw all of one and do not count them ... Just bad in all areas ...
