One of the best lessons I've had on how to watch a movie happened like this: <br /> <br /> I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like many other Wanabees before and, since then, I was doing an internship and trying to figure out how everything worked and how to make me indispensable (ha!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in their own right, asked me to carry a tape. I'm not sure why I wanted to see it. It gave me the impression that it was a student movie or a reel show, something like that, a kind of business card. Regardless of the reasons why he had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at that time was in the room where he was working, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Gradual apparition: on the screen, a figure was sitting on a desk in front of the camera. Behind him, on the screen to the left, was a door that opened onto the room. There was a coat rack against the far wall. A second character came through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy on the desk, turned to answer (that's all, a static camera, no pan cuts, no doll shots, only one is locked in the camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the rack and handed over his next line. Julie Corman said "I've seen enough". And he left the room. <br /> <br /> What he had seen in the ten seconds of images he had seen was that the director was an idiot. Open with two characters who immediately turned their backs on the camera delivering lines? I'm not sorry. Next! That is the time you have. Ten seconds. Throw it in the first shot and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I remembered that moment as I watched the opening of this piece of shit. After a long journey through the jungle, we see several monkeys seemingly throwing themselves into the cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A line plane lands and we watch it roll all the way to the terminal. God this is boring! Cut to the interior of the airport. Two men meet. Hahaha Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie that have some kind of spatial relationship with each other and the boy has risen. 'Not Crossing the line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that prevents characters from jumping side by side on the screen and confusing the audience. Audiences do not like to be confused. Mystified? Embarrassed? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. Audiences love all of those. Confused? No. You lose them. They leave. 'Not Crossing the line' is one of those things that hit you in film school, or they should. It is something basic. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) the directors break it all the time, but not in the first real cut of the film. <br /> <br /> I thought: "I've seen enough". And it goes off.
