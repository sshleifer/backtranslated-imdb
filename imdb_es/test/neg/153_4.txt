I guess I can see why critics give this film two of five stars, it's not fantastic, but I think it's worth seeing, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the dozen, Night at the museum). Basically, 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Frankie Muniz de Middle) often lies to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail the entire semester and will have to repeat the grade during the summer. So he completes his work, but when he gets it from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his role with the story "Big Fat Liar" in the car. Find out in a trailer of the movie that Marty stole the role and is making it into an important movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's the man's Amanda Bynes) have the mission to prove that Jason, for a time, it says the truth. Marty, of course, is too disgusting and cocky to call Jason's father, Harry (Michael Bryan French), and still burns the "Big Fat Liar" newspaper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible, until he agrees to call Jason's dad. They put a blue tint in their pool, and a dye of orange hair in their shampoo, and many more naughty jokes creating chaos for Marty's career. There is an obvious point when it seems that Jason wants to give up, but do not worry, all the characters who despise Marty help in the final operation, and with the arrival of Jason's parents, he finally wants to prove his veracity, and the boy yes He delivers, great style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty. 'Wong. . Muniz is nice, Byrnes shows support with a very surprising talent, and although he is losing a bit of his time and talent, Giamatti is great for being unpleasant. It is a movie for children, so if it seems corny, cheesy or predictable, just keep it in mind and try to enjoy the presentations and the slapstick. Good!
