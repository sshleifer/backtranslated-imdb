(A possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but stupid movie that did its job and was pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had some decent moments, but those were ruined by the final part of the movie that had a T-Rex running full in San Diego. Now, in "Jurassic Park III", the little story that was in the first and in the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by just 90 minutes of basically uninterrupted action, which would have worked if the movie had not been so bad fact. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, whom a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) gives him a proposal to accompany them to an island and help them find their Son , which has been lost for more than 2 months. But, of course, this island is simply populated by dinosaurs and, of course, the plane it is on just crashes and leaves them stranded with a lot of dinosaurs behind them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was intended as an exciting journey, without any real story, but even at that level the film is not delivered. The director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take the little magic that remained in the "Jurassic" movies and squeeze life immediately. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs look good, although at this point, Solo is fair and does not give much fear. The bottom line is that it is not a very good movie, even as an exciting journey. * 4 stars
