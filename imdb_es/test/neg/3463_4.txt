Leatherheads is an appropriate title, however, a leather strap would be more useful to self-flage after buying a ticket to observe this harmful intent of entertainment. Clooney's attempt to disdain humor manifests itself with a dull thud, since his behavior implies that it is nothing. Maybe with another actor who plays the role of Clooney, the movie could be marginally acceptable. I'm sorry George, I doubt there's an Oscar nod this time. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of the water when it comes to comedy (unless you're referring to his politics). Anyway, only Clooney's hottest fans will enjoy watching Leatherheads, everyone else will long for the days of the silent image.
