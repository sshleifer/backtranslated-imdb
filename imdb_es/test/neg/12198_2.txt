I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I really liked it. I do not know what happened to the movie version, because it was terrible. Maybe some dialogue that works on the stage just sounds incoherent on the screen. Anyway, I could not wait for this movie to end. The performance is universally exaggerated. Only Kevin Spacey has it all, and it seems he knows he's in a bad movie and can not wait to get out.
