This takes place in 1920 Harlem. A black-owned nightclub has to deal with corrupt gangs and policemen. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. Try to mix comedy and drama and fail in both. Comedy is simply not fun and drama is boring and badly performed. You think a movie with three comedy legends, Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, would be great, but it's not. There is a non-stop curse and the OPENING scene has a young man killing a man (this is shown as if he was fine). We have also degraded the beautiful Della Reese to play a lady. One of the highlights of the "comedy" has a long, graceless and terribly cruel fight between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. It's not Murphy's worst movie but very close. A 1 all the way.
