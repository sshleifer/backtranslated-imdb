To quote Clark Griswold (on the original Christmas holidays): "WORST? How could things get worse?" Take a look here, Ellen. "We are on the threshold of hell." Chevy Chase did not know he was describing the "sequel" of one of his best movies. Christmas Vacation II sets a new record (or maybe it should be LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD thinking that it would actually be a sequel to the original, but we were very disappointed. This movie is LAME. It is nothing like the original, it is an absolute waste of film and a shame for the good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it. Must have set a record in IMDb for the worst reviews. I really believe that we have a good case to win a class action to recover the money that consumers waste in this movie.
