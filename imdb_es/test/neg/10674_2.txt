Well, some people can go see this to see a vampire bisexual killer dressed in rubber and PVC kicking a butt. If that's what you want, and you put on a cloak, brush your teeth and think that Lilith Silver's name is great, you'll see a good movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, a killer dressed in glistening and crisp rubber with HUGE neckline, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so much I almost cried. Ridiculous acting, dialogue and conspiracy help make this a better parody than Dracula, Dead and Loving. It could be ... <br /> <br /> It tries to be great and gothic, and all it accomplishes is to make each one hilarious scene. Even the licked lesbian scene is funny (how * did * she * take off those boots so fast? They tied up * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Do not see her if you like good movies Look at her if you like them the terrible movies and you want to laugh until you fall ... It's not good, it's bad.
