First of all let's discuss about the story. It's a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian flavor. A man, who is a guru of love, and another man who seems to be an imbecile when it comes to the ladies, and how this seemingly imbecile turns into a charming with the help of the love guru, forms the story. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame boy. <br /> <br /> Now that it comes to the performance of the artists, Salman Khan comments throughout the film, tries to be funny, but fails in a big way. You can see Salman screaming throughout the movie, you do not see any real acting in his performance. Govinda is paired with Katrina Kaif (Oh, my God, she is a great girl, a real beauty) is in real life a 50 year old guy, and Katrina is a girl in her twenties. In the movie, Govinda looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Coming to the execution of the movie. This movie feels like a B-Movie, and a bad imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this film is superficial and purposeless, nowhere is there justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Just forget this movie, as it is nothing but boring, the typical Bollywood fare. Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.
