The comic stories of Michael Allred, particularly his work on Madman, are usually very funny. "Astroesque", the indig film without budget of Allred, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst performance coupled with a truly horrible dialogue makes the film experience brutal. Quite sure that Allred understands that WTF is happening, but he is the only one. It is not enough to challenge you to see the whole disaster ... to challenge yourself to see the whole disaster is more appropriate. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of link to the Allred movie "Red Rocket 7" comic book, which, ironically, is mostly unreadable. So, if your "Astroesca" experience is not terrible enough, definitely track the large comics and continue the fun. <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for Allred, who was totally out of his depth trying a movie. I also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. Please, buy my VHS copy, which is available now on eBay. Hurry up.
