This loose account of Carmen begins with a high note with a hot and sexually frank dance between the prisoner Senora "Karmen" and her prison warden, but the vibrant first minutes never ignite in a coherent film. One minute, Karmen is a sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest against her unjust government, and then, suddenly, she is a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves congratulations for nominating the first carnivorously bisexual "Karmen" , the broad strokes he paints are so similar to those of the vignettes and are not compatible with any narrative coherence that the film appears as a schizophrenic and undisciplined mix of "Basic-Instinct" and "Bound" with an African version of a musical of Bollywood.
