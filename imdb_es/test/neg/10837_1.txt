Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic in almost every respect. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD directly into the bin; I did not even think it was fair to turn it over to the local savings store. <br /> <br /> The effects are beyond a joke. The control room of the dam looks like cardboard. The water looks very out of scale with the funds, nothing works. <br /> <br /> Then there's the limp graphic, with as much depth as a Scooby Doo caricature. <br /> <br /> Wait for everyone to drown.
