In the last years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-term partnerships with several directors, notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also made two films for the former director of Bond, Peter Hunt: the first was the decent hunting hunter of 1981, the second was this indifferent thriller of political persecution. The murder is pretty boring if you know the truth, and in the end, you'll find yourself with a little more passion and rhythm, like The Wilby Conspiracy (for example, to which this movie looks like). <br /> <Br / Bronson walks asleep through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose mission is to protect the wife of US President Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife). Killian believes that Mrs. Craig has been attacked by murderers; she thinks he is an overprotective paranoid pessimist. It turns out, surprise, surprise, that Killian was right all along and that someone is really trying to eradicate it. The two run away, pursued by the murderers. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of a US president is known as the First Lady. For some reason, in this movie they have changed the name to "One Mama"! The whole meaning of this is what anyone can suppose, but it is an indication of the futility of the film as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a long time to get where it's going. If I had to label Murder within a specific genre, I would say that it is supposed to be a "thriller". However, I would say that with some reservations, as if to say that it is a thriller, it has very few emotions.
