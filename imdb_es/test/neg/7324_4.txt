I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There was not a nice character in the image, and the plot was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Masterson is a great actress, but she just did not achieve the "tough girl" character. (He had similar problems with his character in THE SECOND DAY OF Christmas). Maybe I should avoid these characters, especially those with an unpleasant girl to play with. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was not impressive. His character was a brat, simple and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> In the interest of full disclosure, I could not even finish seeing this image. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to lose.
