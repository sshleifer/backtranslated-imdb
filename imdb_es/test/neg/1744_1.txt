I recently posted 8? Going and watching this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time and the only feeling that you leave the theater is a little dizzy from all the disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It could have been interesting if I had had a pretty silly turn, but I had not, so it was just horrible with maybe one or two scenes that could have been taken out and turned into very nice movies. <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought about is the way the director uses all the Finish stereotypes as characters. It's quite extraordinary how you, as the director of Finish, can make a film with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit down and listen to the audience sit and laugh at things they thought were typical of Finish, but in general it's just making fun of people.
