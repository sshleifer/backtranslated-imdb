The Calu, and now what? Yes, I also thought it was a stupid name. Chris Carter remains happily unaware of the scum on his writing team. Starting with the usual teaser of the joyful X Files (a baby hit by a train) this episode ... well, I can not say it goes downhill because, to be honest, it was never uphill. <br /> <br /> Written poorly, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at first) the writer makes us hate the characters before brutally killing them, it is the worst technique of all. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hating them? Do not ask me <br /> <br /> It's not only boring and not scary, it's like watching a very bad sequel to Omen with exaggerated and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, that it's the least of my worries)). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno started her X Files career with a moan and luckily ended with one as well. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> In the words of my math teacher, Mr. Laverack: "Horrible, horrible ..."
