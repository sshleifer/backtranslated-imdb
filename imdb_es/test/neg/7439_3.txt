A cash without meaning without anything to contribute, except the badness, this is a definite case of seconds careless for Robocop. The insensitivity, the plot less and the weariness of a sequel to Irvin Kershner are visible and even entertaining in a dubious and unpleasant way, but it has practically nothing of the style, emotion, intelligence or emotion of the original. Instead, we just have another empty show of a blockbuster whose only reason for existing seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence, which is much more gratuitous than the original. Omni Consumer Products, who created the original Robocop cyborg, has become a totalitarian force more than ever, the second time, with the suspicious posters of Nazi-esquire, assault guards and rental tanks at the end; As for the Old Anonymous (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less a benevolent protector and more a horrible type of Mr. Burns, surrounded by moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of The New Robocop 2 It is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop gets a look somewhere in the middle of all this mess, although one wonders what the hell an actor like Peter Weller saw in the script. Draco Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while Nancy Allen is squandered as a companion to Robocop. There are some fun moments along; The opening commercial 'Magnavolt', for example, but this is a bad follow-up of the really cool original.
