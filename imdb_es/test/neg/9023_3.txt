While most of Wayne's B's efforts are entertaining in a fun way, this film is very little edited and written, it's a failure. Only the first ten minutes show Wayne and the bandits in night scenes are interwoven with archive images, obviously filmed during the day. Dwire plays a half white, half Apache villain with a strong Mexican accent and it seems he can not achieve any nationality! I give this a 3.
