This is not exactly a complicated story. It is not a mystery, nor a plot in which you have to take time to look again because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialogue. The claim of a movie must be seen several times so that "get it" is applied to very few movies, however, this is not one of them. These types of films have content and are so complicated that it is easy to miss an important part of the dialogue or a subtle nuance to trace details that may have been overlooked. With the ghosts of Goya this does not apply. The main flaw in this movie is the absence of details. Jumps from one character to another, never gives enough substance to a set of scenes to allow the participation of the spectators. That's why you do not connect with any of the characters. You do not get to the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone, just when the movie looks like it's going to redeem itself, or its actions are contemptible and you're not willing to do it anyway. Goya's refusal to go too far to help Ines is a good example. Your refusal to commit reflects the general tone of your part. The only characters you can feel for a moment are Ines, when they interrogate her and then torture her. After his rape by Lorenzo, any focus on his character has disappeared. After that, the only other deep participation comes from the best scenes in the film centered on Lorenzo's invitation to dine with In√©s' family, and his parents try to force Lorenzo to sign a false confession and recover his daughter. Then, just when things start to develop again, they leave the movie. I have read many of the comments here about how the film did not know what I wanted to be, etc. I discovered that basically he did not have much success in anything. Since the return of Lorenzo and the coinciding visualization of the daughter of Ines by Goya, everything seemed nothing more than an invention. Without much argument, no effort was made to really examine the turbulent times in which they lived. The essence of who Goya was did not materialize, apart from his actions, or the lack of them, proving that he was more egocentric than anything else. As for his art, the film seemed to intend to examine some of the paintings he did, but again he missed another opportunity by examining the reactions to this work instead of the work itself. To summarize things better, the film had no cohesion, lacked the necessary substance to delve into the historical environment that covered, and at the end, left you with the feeling that what you just saw was a series of unsuccessful attempts to attract the viewer changing from one thing to another without properly engaging the viewer in any of them. You can not see something like this several times waiting for it to get better with an additional test. There simply is not enough to waste time. It's not a case of you missing something, it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good, just are not there. As for the best movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I've seen today.
