This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story, no character and some dialogue would have been good. The effects of bleeding are good and they become quite bloody at times, but nothing more. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that ends the scene with the girl begins. Music is a classical score and fits very well with the movie. They should have made a 90-minute version in which they might have had some time for the development of the character, so we may feel bad about the person at the autopsy table. And a little more information about the Martians would have made this movie so much more terrifying than it is. Do not expect a scary movie, but a beautiful and bloody special effects roll.
