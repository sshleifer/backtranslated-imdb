I tried to see this, and I was very disappointed. Do not expect an intelligent and insightful mood until Amy's brother Amy in the middle of this ambush ... is the polar opposite. But if you like the jokes of poop, fart and boner, you will be in seventh heaven. This is the bathroom humor directed, I suppose, to those who have had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic critics have advertised this crap as "the best television script ever." I guess those who hate such simple humor could not look long enough to send a review, but I'm just sending a warning photo to unconscious viewers looking for a high-level comedy. The characters overact. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laughter is set to zero (unless, of course, you look for youthful and low-brow humor). <br /> <br /> I managed it for 40 minutes, praying all the time. I would turn the corner towards an entertainment that was worth it, but, unfortunately, it got worse and worse. And be careful with Hammy's expression of overexcitement, always present, that will roll his eyes. It was nice to see cameos from recognizable comic actors that I enjoy, but I can only assume that they agreed to participate as a favor for the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> Those who loved it, I'm sorry ... This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
