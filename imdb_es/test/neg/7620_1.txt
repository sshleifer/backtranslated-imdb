Do you know what farmers spray in the fields? That's right, the manure, so when the BBC decided to do a conspiracy thriller about GMOs and agriculture, we got the most odorous manure that the BBC has inflicted on its public. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> FIELDS OF GOLD opens with a group of scientists masked in a laboratory where a scientist (according to the BBC right, all scientists are women) announces "A new wheat variety that will save the third world of hunger ", then the story changes to another equally insipid scene. If you're going to do a thriller of any kind, should not you open it with a hook that attracts the audience? DOCTOR WHO was brilliant in this as THE X-FILES was, while 28 DAYS AFTER it was opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. I guess someone at the BBC did not think that this thriller needed a hook because the spectators had trailers stuck in their throat weeks in advance. <br /> <br /> As the story (not very exciting) continues, a couple of journalists (One is a drunk man with a lower morality than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined, while the other is a virtuoso journalist) who investigates patients in a county hospital who could be beaten by "Miseric√≥rdo murders" " It is at this point that things start to get confused when the journalist is threatened by ghosts of MI5 and the first episode ends with the ghost of MI5 killed. <br /> <br /> The second episode reveals that the patients of the county hospital I have actually been dying due to being infected with a VRSA superbug. This is when things go totally out of hay wire. Throughout all of FIELDS OF GOLD, the audience has been led to believe that the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths, but they are not. It turns out that the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends with the work of the camera THE MATRIX with the drunken journalist setting fire to a field full of VRSA, thus spreading the superbacterium throughout the earth < br /> <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of its broadcast, I was a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. Since then I have given up my time in the environmental movement, but even now I feel somewhat offended by the way ecologists are portrayed and the fact that the bad guy spreads a fatal genetic engineering virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. It's a bit like a member of the CND releasing a nuclear bomb in London to warn about the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offended by how the male characters were written as bastards, while all the females were very intelligent and morally superior to the men. There are also other problems with the script, especially with respect to VRSA. If, unlike the writers, you take the time and the problem of investigating VRSA and you will find that it is completely different from what you see here. Oh, and if you set fire to diesel, it does not explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles the structure of JEEPERS CREEPERS, so the last ten minutes contradict most of what has been done before. Where JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes FIELDS OF GOLD lasted twice that length, so it's doubly irritating and illogical <br /> <br /> As an environmentalist note, environmentalism is never a good theme for a thriller (? Does anyone remember those Steven Segal movies?) and it's time for film and television producers to realize this.
