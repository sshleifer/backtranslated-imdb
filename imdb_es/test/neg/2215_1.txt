There is something about the appearance of Doug McLure in a movie that is a guarantee of misery. Your DG initials are like a special film certification, which appears somewhere before 'U'. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Cushing seemed to suffer both from a dilatory agent and from his own bad judgment. He did an excellent job in Hammer's films like Dr. Van Helsing. I've seen him make a very good Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his masterpiece was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first "Star Wars". The only man, except the emperor, who could tell Darth Vadar to "stop arguing" and get away with it. But ... Crikey! - He has made some turkeys. There was that unfortunate 'Daleks' movie for one. And here is another one. <br /> <br /> There is a machine that has been hijacked from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw in the front and traction devices on the sides. I'm surprised that Jerry Anderson has not sued for plagiarism. Maybe it was bought. However, if the movie is a guide, they can not have paid you much. <br /> <br /> It's 1976 and we're still playing with latex suits. <br /> <br /> That's all really. Some movies have an entertainment value in the category "so bad that it's good". This does not even succeed. I would not even entertain the children. The 'Crash Corrigan' things of the 1930s have more in their favor.
