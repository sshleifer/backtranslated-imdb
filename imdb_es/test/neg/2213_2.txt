It's amazing to think that this movie came out just a year before Star Wars, but it seems a million years ago in sophistication and special effects. Actually, the art direction and stage design (nice Victorian spaceship) are not bad; the costumes of monsters are the most ridiculous, they resemble the monsters of the "rubber suit" type of the television program LOST IN SPACE. The evil caveman reminded me of some of the aliens from the old TWILIGHT ZONE replays. <br /> <br /> The script is limited, and outside of Peter Cushing's comical relief, the acting is also quite miserable. This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy a bad kitsch SF. And the music ... Oh! A horrible experiment of the 70 with synthesizers that does not fit the time period of the movie and that sounds like someone wandering with a Minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
