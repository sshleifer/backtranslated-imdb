Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, whatever. Honestly, I'm not so surprised that more people have not seen this movie. The only reason I saw Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They did not. This movie is as bad, if not worse, than the first. That clown ... that damn clown ... I hate him! I hate it so much! And I do not hate it because it's a good villain ... I hate it because it's a nuisance that you can not believe! I hope the filmmakers have realized, after trying and failed, that this film is irreparable. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
