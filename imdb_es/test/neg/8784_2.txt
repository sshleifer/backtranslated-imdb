Would you be surprised if my ears and eyes almost bled to see and hear this horrible movie? My eyes almost bled to see the horrible animation and the insipid story, without plot and empty. My ears almost bled when I heard the songs that sounded as if they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted due to the complete lack of intelligence of this movie. It is formulable every step of the way. Talking about animals is one thing, but a penguin that can fly just to keep up with "dreams can come true"? Show a little more faith in children's intelligence please. Along with Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
