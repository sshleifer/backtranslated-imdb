Tony Curtis and Skip Homier wear black canvas shoes with white trim in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank that is being inflated. It must have been too hard for the feet of the young stars. If the true marines had been on the mission, they would have been wearing boots. In the first scenes they removed their legs before starting their small trip to find the farmer. When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes, Tony and Skip are wearing combat boots, then, when Lovejoy and Curtis meet Framer and their daughter, Tony, is wearing the "tennis shoes", but they have been blackened . The film is about a true story, but do they really need the love interest?
