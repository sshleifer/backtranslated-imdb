Let Freedom Ring was made with the best of intentions, but sends a curious mixed message in the final product. <br /> <br /> The people of a western city where the railroad arrives are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers, working on the railroad financed by thief thief Edward Arnold. There are a few ranchers and farmers whose land is on the railroad road and these people are treated in a summarized way by the contracted men of Arnold. A man who does not give in is Lionel Barrymore, whose son comes from Harvard with a lawyer and is ready to take on the rancher's cause. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go to Zorro about the bad guys. But apart from Charles Butterworth, no one knows that he is the Wasp (by the way, a very interesting choice of names). <br /> <br /> What Arnold has done is to use the tried and true methods of the Eastern political bosses, making immigrants vote. Nelson's idea is simple: if immigrants only knew the truth about how bad Arnold is, they will vote with the original settlers and eliminate the extraterrestrial urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps the publisher of the newspaper Raymond Walburn and takes him and the press to a cave in the mountain where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railroad workers are a real group of immigrants, not the Irish who work in the west or the Chinese work in the east as history has. It is a true UN working on the Arnold Railroad. Victor McLaglen keeps the workers in line, and Nelson has the difficult task of making some sense, as did John Wayne in The Quiet Man. <br /> <br /> Of all the films that starred Jeanette and Nelson and They have certainly gone down in history as a duo, this was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that are indefinite at best, but certainly not worth being hanged. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, saves the day with a version of My Country Tis of Thee that immigrants join. In the face of a revolt of his paid immigrant voters, Arnold rationally packs and leaves the city to build his railroad somewhere else. <br /> <br /> No kidding, that's the end here. What is the message, vote with the settlers and lose their jobs with Arnold? But somehow you're going to go through here? <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if 20 years after the incidents of this film happened and the city settled in a haven of sleep from the west, while some cities where the railway has arrived that are now cities, that the good citizens of that city have not rethought what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they're probably running over it. <br /> <br /> Nelson, of course, has a good voice and has a wide variety of concerts and popular pieces to sing, including a ballad for immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg. , Where else but here The song is a sincere tribute from an immigrant who did well in his adopted country. Too bad there is not a better place. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the blond almost platinum Virginia Bruce is bent here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was so glad she had not been accompanying Nelson on this trip to the west.
