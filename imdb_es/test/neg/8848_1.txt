I do not see this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the new American version. However, this movie was terrible. The ghosts, like a trick or a treatment device dressed as a sheet ghost, moan and puff out in an attempt to be scared by the lack of good makeup or special effects, and the acting is simply awful. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, everything is not explained, letting the film go from bad to worse. Do not waste time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more entertaining things to do, like looking at the painting in its tracks.
