In the real world of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy queen of the drama that all men want to do, but nobody wants to wake up next. Her screen interpreter, Christina Ricci, is the ugly aspiring artist who desperately wants each and every man, but no man will touch her. That's why, in Prozac Nation, the unpublished film from the best-selling book of Wurtzel in the 1990s with the same name, immediate problems arise. Okay, the problems start before the confusion of Ricci, who has the emotional range of a thimble. Is it any wonder that, by far, his best performance was in the two films of the Addams family? In the first place, it has a strange appearance, with large eyes and a bulging forehead, which makes it look like the 2001 fetal star: a space odyssey. Secondly, she always plays sniveling brats. But, third, it's the way movies try to make it look like any man would be attracted to her. In one scene from the movie, her friend Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the boys' tongues move against Ricci, not the super cute and sexy Williams. Hello ??. Reality check time ?? This material prayed for the treatment of Andy Warhol. Here is your version of the movie. A five minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five-minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. Five minutes from her she slept nude and stoned on the bed. She gets up, gives the middle finger to the audience. Credits of cue. Look, less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's whole life. And, oh yes, Warhol's movie would not have kicked Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pale chest, I would take whatever Williams or any other baby offered to me cinematically. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a movie, and how she continues to work is a mystery. Think of your acting in mediocre and bad films like Monster, Sleepy Hollow and Anything Else by Woody Allen, also co-starring Jason Biggs, and now imagine another actress in your role, and immediately the movies may look better, if not great. She is the female counterpart of banal, wooden and milquetoast actors such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
