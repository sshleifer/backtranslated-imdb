From time to time it is highly recommended that the aristocracy watch a silent film about the hard life of ordinary people to remember the privileges and comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before. In comparison with the complicated and hard work that ordinary people have to endure every day, since aristocrats govern the world. <br /> <br /> And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film directed by Dame France Marion that will be famous later in the silent and talkative world thanks to his work as a screenwriter; better for her, certainly, because her career as a film director does not impress this German count. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford) a cheerful Italian girl who lives surrounded by a "picturesque misery" (a difference of opinion important between the upper and lower classes, the aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury"); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him in return is indifference. Destiny begins to work hard and soon war is declared and the two brothers of Dame Angela get ready and in the next roll both are dead. But fate is even crueler and Dame Angela, meanwhile, falls in love with? a German!! And to make matters worse, she does not know that her Teutonic sweetness is a spy and that the light tells her that she sends him every night from the lighthouse that keeps thinking it is a sign of love, does not mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but " Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea "?? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dame Angela, very soon her sweet German spy will be found by the neighbors in her house in which she was hiding (and not made strange, in fact, because it is not an easy task for a German go unnoticed, but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by those Italians. <br /> <br /> Of that German love, will the average Teutonic baby be born (the evil Destiny at full speed?) but a Greedy neighbor who has a particular idea of ​​motherhood will take his son with the consent of a Catholic nun who has taken the Council of Trent to extremes - a fact that will put Dame Angela on the verge of madness. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, the secret admirer of Dame Angela has returned from the war and you may think that finally the sad life of Dame Angela will improve, a huge mistake because Destiny has reserved for her that the returned soldier is blind. they say in Alemani a, it can be a blessing in disguise and, finally, Dame Angela will regain her son and start a new life with her blind partner in a poor Italian town in what is supposed to be a happy ending for ordinary people. people. <br /> <br /> As this German count said before, for Dame Frances Marion it was much better that she continued her career as a screenwriter, because as you can see in "The Love Light", she had many things. of imagination to invent incredible stories, ja wohl! ?? but a completely different theme is directing the films and their silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm despite the efforts of Dame Pickford to involve the audience with their many misfortunes. The nonexistent cinematographic narrative causes indifference in the spectator, which makes this the kind of film in which only Dame Pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I should take it temporarily. my permission because this German count must send Morse signals from the north tower of Schloss to one of his rich Teutonic heiresses.
