First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about vampires and Lycans and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series, I feel sorry for how pathetic vampires are. At least in the first part you had the leather clothes tight ... now the vampires seem to be victims besieged by problems of pest control. They look and act like humane white pasty haughty. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were clean ... the whole issue with the human nobles was interesting. Too bad the performance was abysmal. The slave thing was also feasible. <br /> <br /> Other things just seemed pathetic to me. Spoilers now. The castle walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies that do not attack during the day? Big and bad old vampires that take years to join the fight and then flee from a budding Lycan leader after a minute? Werewolves give near their enemies? The Lycans attacking the armor ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader so inept that he manages to have almost everyone against him? Romance is as unconvincing as it is sad. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not recommend this movie unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Part of the action is good for good. Certainly the armor and weapons of the vampires are interesting. Otherwise, a very weak script that was poorly assembled and used all kinds of inane plot twists.
