LIVE THE BAM This spin off "Jackass" focuses on the adventures (obviously scripted) of Bam Margera and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This program, although it has its fair share of crazy comedies and tricks, focuses mainly on Bam's torture of his parents. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say this, Bam, but ... you're not as cool as you think you are. This show of the shot ego is not only painfully inconvenient (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The too-stylized introduction ends with Bam coldly explaining that he is going to do "whatever the fuck" he wants. How about doing something that is really fun? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The camera work was horrible, any idiot could have done a better show with a camcorder in his parents' garage, but at least the show moved at a steady pace and he never felt bored among the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting tricks that friends made. . <br /> <br /> Not so with "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero when he plays tricks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but it never feels like anything other than a really boring and scripted comedy. The tricks and jokes are slightly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and boring way that they can hardly make you smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a little scandal, but it is useless. Feed the already too large ego of Margera. I do not recommend this show lame and without imagination to anyone.
