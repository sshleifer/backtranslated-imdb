Presented as a romantic comedy in front of the first years of the Second World War, it is not fulfilled. The problem is that, although it is beautifully photographed, it does not have a coherent story or narrative. Beginning as a murder mystery, it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history. Depardieu is wasted in a trivial role that, obviously, he does not feel comfortable playing. Adjani can not take the photo. The hero is not; Obviously, an imitation of a role of Hitchcock "wrongly accused" lacks balance. Neither heroic, comical nor with suspense. <br /> <br /> This could have been a good movie. It reminds me of "The Lady Vanishes" that combined suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
