Many actors have a multitude of good roles in cinema in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there's Linda Blair. "The Exorcist". That is all. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chain Chained" and you see Linda Blair in it, you should ask yourself what would happen to her mind, if anything. <br /> <br /> Certainly not, "Oh, boy: Oscar for the best actress, here I go!" <br /> <br /> Just another movie of women in prison like they used to do for little money in the 70s, this one actually has names that you might recognize. . John Vernon plays the dean ... I mean, the warden (with a hot tub in his office, you wonder what he said to the contractor?), Stella Stevens shows up, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how badly they needed the job. <br /> <br /> And a special mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the movements on poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is how Sybil does it and everything Sybil does is perfect. It makes you forget the terrible movie you're watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and one for trying to pass Linda Blair as a sex symbol. What could have possessed them (understood?)?
