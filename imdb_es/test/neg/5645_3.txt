The growth of tax funds and the sale and lease plans have led to a series of insurmountable films that are accumulating dust in the laboratories and vaults of all the British Isles, since they seem to have been made simply because they conform to the financial criteria instead of having them. potential audience A lucky few get a week on a small screen in London before going to an affordable DVD, but The Riddle distinguished itself by completely bypassing the cinema, television or even the rental market to debut as a free gift DVD on the Mail on Sunday. <Br /> <br /> It is very easy to see why this ended up being literally given away. Apart from a couple of failures (a microphone boom is clearly visible in one shot) it is not particularly badly done, and while Vinnie Jones appears as the version of Freddie Mills Mills, of modern British cinema, as the greyhound reporter he wants To advance to crime the desk and the cast of support go from the ham to the vaguely passable, nobody distinguishes here for being extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that, like so many movies selling and leasing taxes, it's a "soft" movie, there's no reason to see it. It exists because the circumstances existed for it to be done, but it lacks rhythm or forward momentum. It seems to be pointing to the Sunday TV audience (despite being shot in Scope), but it does not cut it. There are a couple of interesting ideas in this story with harmless determination of an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in the modern Limehouse, but the mysterious element is painfully obvious, as is the last-minute supernatural turn. I'll never guess who he is really the vagabond of Jacobi. What, you guessed?) - you almost expect Scooby Gang or Double Deckers to appear to solve it. <br /> <br /> It's a very badly planned movie. for all kinds of reasons: a few cast members play double roles when they should not even be playing one, and all the revealing shock of the truth of Dickens' manuscript is completely confused because everything is narrated in the first person by Dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel. The main murder in the film is awkwardly integrated into the main plot, with characters that suddenly remind Vinnie that he has forgotten about that, announcing an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees the evil secretary of developer Jason Flemyng putting Something of Rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so he can have his perverse way with him and leave incriminating photos behind "to make you look with your girlfriend", which leads him to have a dream in which he talks to Charles Dickens ("You are Charles Dickings "" What's in a name? "), Who offers a somewhat less likely suggestion that" you read too many books. " But all that is nothing compared to the end, which falls into a complete absurdity, with logic and common sense completely out of the window while playing as a strange Jacobean tragedy of revenge with pistols on the banks of the Thames, with stars Two-day guests. Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave look as if they would have preferred to be somewhere else (Mel Smith appears in a one-day cameo, so it's clear that the "names" of the movie are mostly there for $ 10k or to meet their payouts. alimony). However, the final image of the film is so absurd and meaningless that it is almost worth seeing. <br /> <br /> A curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third of Vera Day, a kind of Liz Fraser prototype and a pillar of the British films of the 50s: the waitress of Hell Drivers, the A waitress from Quatermass II, she became the owner of a pub here, while comedian Kenny Lynch appears briefly to offer the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as, oh, irony, a coroner ... <br /> <br /> To complete the package, the free DVD also included a trailer of the other director's movie with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, an unpleasant-looking British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie on Elmer Fudd's duck-hunter team terrified by a reanimated sacrificial victim of 2000 years of the nearest mob ("Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting dwuids "). I can hardly wait ... <br /> <br /> However, the only thing I can guarantee is that all independent producers in the UK will spend the next few weeks trying to figure out exactly how much the Post paid. for the license to press the DVD (Prince was paid Â£ 250,000 for his new CD). With so many British tax stores on the shelf and with the money so hard to find at the moment, this could become an interesting alternative market for British films.
