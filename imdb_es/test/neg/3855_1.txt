Ok, I'm usually pretty open about movies. I can usually see a good part of a movie that has been totally deceived by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I will not waste much energy in telling you what happens, but think that Bill and Ted run into the worst movie of the Police Academy and they all won 'Be away. <br /> <br /> What really caught my attention in this movie was the stupid purile racism that was evident at all times. The general theme of the Latino / Black guys = cool, the white guys = lame is a bit funny for the first jokes, but when the same joke has been reiterated for the 500th time (not an exaggeration by the way) it becomes boring and offensive . <br /> <br /> I spent months waiting for the laws of Karma to return to John Leguizamo for this film. I had almost lost hope when the 'My VH1 Awards' were screened live in the UK. What followed was Mr. Leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian on stage. You should be a complete sadist to laugh at him. Ahem. Say ah! Say ah! Say ah!
