I can not believe this program was fine. First, J. P. Manoux does an awful job to complete the voice of David Spade and Pacha is too deep compared to that of John Goodman. The song of the subject is very annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid. The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are still the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, The Emperor's New Groove was one of the best movies for children in years, but they were completely ruined by making Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should see programs like Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible but not this program.
