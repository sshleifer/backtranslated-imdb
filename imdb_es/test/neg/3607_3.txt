... but, of course, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now, I never expected that I would like the first movie. I'm not sure what happens with the Disney marketing group, but it seems that all the trailers they make for an animated film make me too childish, stupid or stupid and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. And no film seemed worse in the trailers than The Emperor's New Groove, so I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying that movie when I finally broke it and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained. <br /> <br /> Despite Disney's track record with direct sequels to the video, I still expected a better Kronk experience here ... but in the end it was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately I was not surprised that I felt A) Yes). There is almost no humor directed at adults. The original songs are boring and sickly cute. The animation, although not bad, still does not approach the Emperor (who was not a Lion King to begin with). <br /> <br /> The main plot, as such, is surprisingly "minor" and is composed mainly of a sequence of mini-frame flashbacks: in fact, the thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a Cartoon series on Saturday mornings that a unique entity well conceived. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets about four lines throughout the whole movie and there is not exactly much of John Goodman either, so in general we only have a lot of Kronk left of Patrick Warburton, who was entertained as a supporting character in the first movie, but it's completely inappropriate as the main lead here. <br /> <br /> Even if the kids find it a bit funny, the only thing that Kronk's New Groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and see the original much higher.
