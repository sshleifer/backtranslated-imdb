Maybe we, the Australians, have a totally different sense of humor and, therefore, my lie is the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs that I own (including those received as gifts, which is what it was) and, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb to obtain information such as gender, execution time, director, clients potentials, etc. this, I noticed that it was a comedy and that's why I decided to see it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was not any! There was absolutely no laughter whatsoever and an inordinate amount of gratuitous insults (are there REALLY radio announcers who can emit the kind of filth that Steve Jones delivers? What happens if a decent kid tunes into his station?). <Br /> <br /> Instead of enjoying a good laugh (or even a small giggle) I found everything depressing. I've given it 3 out of 10, but, to be honest, I do not know what those 3 are for! I guess the basics of lighting and sound were not so bad! <br /> <br /> We have a seemingly broken loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays the fuel?) and live in what could be a good apartment (who pays his rent ?) Given the opportunity to form what could have been some kind of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a good girl, she even spoiled it! Maybe it was she (Lynn Collins) who won this movie with 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper instead of a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense ("I do so much in one night doing this as in two weeks of hairdressing"). <br /> <br /> Unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!
