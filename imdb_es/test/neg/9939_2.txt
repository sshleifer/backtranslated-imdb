Creepy masks and slasher films have come together like cheese and chives throughout the long cycle life. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who initiated the trend, but as is the case with many of the clich√©s of the genre, the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of a maniac hooded in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American slasher predating Halloween that deserve a mention. Massacre in the classroom, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend before 1978, while The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely considered one of the first movies for teenagers. <br /> <br /> The carpenter's seminal film may not have been the first masked nightmare, but it certainly began the competitive race between the directors to reveal the most spooky disguise for their bogey men. Over the years, we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favorites should be: the maniac miner of My Bloody Valentine, the sadistic soldier of The Prowler and the cowardly assassin of Wicked Games. I am also interested in many of the killer clowns that have appeared throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row should be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight is also among the best crazy costumes. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are broadly linked to sexual perversion, which of course is not a frightening disguise. But in recent years, both Blackout and this darkness decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with an attractive suit. This is how it went to the last of the two? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with the blast of blue sirens, while the cops run to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman may have had enough of being chosen as an extra in the raw turkeys with low eyebrows, so he has decided to keep his wife and son at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight with the gunman, but unfortunately for him, he loses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it seems to be the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, he was saved at the last moment thanks to the precision of the aim of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the most popular police officer in the California Police Department. <br /> <br /> Her heroic encounter gives the brunette a promotion to first class detective, and it is a feat that is strongly envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a leather-clad maniac is circling the city killing prostitutes and throwing their bloody bodies at the corners of the streets. Ryder and Shine are put in the case of the murderous gim and his first interrogation call is a seedy street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is an inspector of such high level that the normal police regulation does not seem to apply to her, so in a short time she is going out with the cameraman even though she is suspect number one. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to expel the madman from S & M. <br /> <br /> In any case, Zipperface effortlessly sums up everything that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its reins. What began as a great springboard for future filmmakers and actors had been reduced to a network of film feces for films with a flat direction, without suspense or punches and mediocre actors without talent. The boom years of the early eighties managed to disguise their lack of strong dramatic formations with special sticky effects and exciting directional flourishes. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycle, titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes seemed to have been produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the characters mentioned above ended. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams is not even vaguely convinced that a law enforcement officer and her inexplicably idiotic behavior, which includes doing a striptease for a suspect in a nationwide murder investigation, is more you'll be stunned by what you could never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic and the vast majority of cast members struggled to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but here I found nothing of merit or note. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you can keep the TV on until the end, you may be surprised enough by the identity of the killer. However, to be honest, I doubt that for that moment you care. And another point in favor? Well, erm ... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means you could use it as a matte to place your cup of tea. Apart from that, there really is no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is 90 minutes of my life that could have happened in a more constructive way tearing my hair out of my chest. Abysmal.
