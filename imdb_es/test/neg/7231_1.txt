I just finished seeing this after getting tired of preparing for the Michigan Bar exam. I wanted something that did not make sense and I could just sit back and say "what the hell were you thinking?" I was not disappointed with this venture, but if I had been seeing this seriously, I would have been furious. The company that did this thing just joined CGI images from the first Octopus and added a small image with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "Bride of the Monster" look like a masterpiece of special effects images. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that a NYPD diver is investigating some murders / disappearances in the Hudson River shortly before July 4. He and his partner (who will soon be transferred, or who will soon be eaten by an octopus fig) investigate in a rather inept way (while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey of the mayor's office . Of course, one believes that an octopus can become so big until the thing attacks the policeman and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly, all hell is not unleashed and only a few policemen and a few other civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really lame. Do not bother with that.
