Louis Gossett Jr. returns to the well once more as Chappy Sinclair, who turns to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux, who favors Jason Gedrick, who wisely refused) to teach a new recruiting band. treat in toxic waste. This is a series that continues to get worse with each subsequent entry, however, it has nothing zip or action to make it worthwhile to watch it by cable. Iron Eagle IV is headed so carelessly that dog fights are triggered as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's horrible to see him and Gossett Jr, who has done his share of turkeys, seems to have hit rock bottom here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do something while he is working. When I look at his post, Oscar wins. Some of his best films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the last two films have him co-starring with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it's something that says that three guilty pleasure action movies are competing for their best work. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown are still his best post-Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
