Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of the theme. The idea of ​​Ellis Island's experience at the turn of the century centered on a small group is intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat. Much of the story is simply boring; It does not pass much by long stretches. The director uses ridiculous images (offered in the form of dream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break the glacial rhythm, but instead, hits the authentic look and feel of the film. The characters are also badly drawn. In the end, we do not care as much about them as we should. It is a pity that this was not what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the experience of American immigrants, but this one is not.
