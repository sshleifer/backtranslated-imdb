Corny and horrible, I was not surprised that this short-lived show did not succeed. I remember fondly when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse these corny episodes as if they were really scary. Along with the bad performance and the terrible music, I was surprised that this cruel demonstration was conceived. It never appeared again, and only one can be grateful for this circumstance.
