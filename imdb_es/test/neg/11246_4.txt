... this is not worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done can not properly be called cinema; rather, they simply chose sixteen students of some diversity (though not as many as those who suggest the revisions) and released them. The results are, to be brutally frank, much more often boring, self-indulgent, exaggerated and annoying than the truly insightful. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of the type It is only possible in documentary films, but in general there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or, in reality, a television documentary decent of the same type. Although full of comments on sex, sexual diversity and racism, the film does not bring anything to the table that is useful to anyone who has thought about any of these issues seriously. And while certain segments are good for nothing more than injecting some comic relief (no doubt welcome), most often the five-minute limit avoids getting emotionally involved with any of the students. An interesting idea, but with the thumb down for the CHAIN ​​CHAIN.
