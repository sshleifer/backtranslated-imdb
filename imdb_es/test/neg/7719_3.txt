I can not forget how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of setting up the scenes in a creative way, it is based on old and boring zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed drivers have to go down the steps of the university to the truck, surrounds them with zombies, but neither of them. is bitten You can not bother to direct a decent fight scene, so we see that the drivers make their way down the stairs. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the zombies limp and in others they run like the wind. This is really convenient for the director because he can configure what he wants without bothering to continue the behavior of the zombies. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and much more inspiration, this movie could have been much better. .
