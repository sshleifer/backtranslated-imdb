4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie was not funny in general nor was it worth investing any emotion in the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the most fun ... The rest of the cast does its job, but the story never gets very deep and there are many holes in the plot that never fill up. This was not very fun, despite being fun at times. <br /> <br />
