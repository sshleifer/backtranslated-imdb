Do not see the "Mr. Wizard". It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Leslie Nielson was not funny at that. It has not been fun since the Naked Gun movies. Well, we will soon discover that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the movie is ridiculously silly. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie had stayed that way.
