A good example of the differences between American cinema and abroad can be seen in a film I saw recently on television: Indecent Proposal. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of Indecent Proposal, David and Diane Murphy are Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. . I'm not sure if it was because of their total lack of chemistry or that they did not act well, but why we should care so much if these two stay together surpasses me. Love, affection, joy, attraction? none of these materialized on the screen in their interactions together. <br /> <br /> As I knew that eventually Robert Redford would appear, it was clear from the start that the good part, the flesh of the film, would be the Scenes between him and demi moore. Poor Woody Harrelson could not muster any emotion for the movie. He seemed to be holding back, worried about the recoil of his hair. <br /> <br /> OK, very fast. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are to think they can recover the $ 50,000 they owe when betting. There is no faux pas acting there, only a horribly bad, lazy and unforgivable writing. Of course they lose all their money. Surprised? I know it was not. Does Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie)? a romantic, maybe emotionally frigid, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and although not a great actor, next to those two, Redford looks like Olivier. Immediately he falls in love and covets with Diane and we, the spectators, for once, feel it. This is how to love a woman! Not David's way, swapping gum mouth-to-mouth with Diane on a slimy dock. (Did I see it right?) Like Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it is meant to instruct the seemingly brain-dead audience that there is a Rich Man here, but it also looks great and, at this point, the audience with mental death appreciates it! Another costume symbolism includes David's now ironed shirts at the end of the film, which means resolution, joining them after a long interlude of wearing a wrinkled and sad shirt. <br /> <br /> And what about the California garden parties as shown? In the Hollywood movies Suddenly, everyone seems British, with lace dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And, of course, the umbrella. Yes, Diane, her transformation to Rich Man's fiancee now complete, is there at the auction, delicately twirling an umbrella. Although she insisted that she could not buy it, she finally succumbed to sexual tension. This is where the film branches to the pure American. I mean, of course David and Diane will end up together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a long time? How can you get out of the romantic sexual bondage of this sexy older man just because Woody Harrelson takes his hair to the garden party, sits down and looks Demi Moore in the eye? That is not what happens. I was so weak. <br /> <br /> But we must have our happy ending. We have to swallow the Moral Lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to have it otherwise. Principal Lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the youth group, the young people. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties where there is not a SUV, a T-shirt or a baseball cap in sight, such films also have a reliable public transportation system that connects cities and the municipalities of California. How else to symbolize the return to the middle class or the life of the working class?
