This was so bad, I want God to give me two extra hours of life having had to go through this. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was uniformly bad. There was hardly a plot, unless he "tells the story of a hairy dog ​​with a guy with a rain poncho and a skeleton mask instead of a dog". <br /> <br /> The edition was all over the place, and the slow motion shots of the "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air, no doubt thrown with a spoon) became irritating after the tenth time, and after the hundredth time. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He has done a good job. This was not good. This was less than good. And with that, I mean it stunk. Hard. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, do not watch this movie.
