There are certain scenes in this movie (like the hero's first encounter with the super villain Shirley Eaton) where he seems to be about to break sexual taboos and make his premise (women want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but He never dares to do it. The result is a film without sexuality and some domestic violence. Despite the ragged plot, the film is not too bad until its climax, where its amateur character is rampant (terrible edition, excessive use of archival material). It's worth seeing just as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
