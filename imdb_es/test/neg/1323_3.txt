The war in the east, as the Germans referred to the Soviet-Nazi conflict of the Second World War, was a war of annihilation on the part of Germany. 90% of the German army was in the struggle of the Soviet Union. Their ultimate goal was to eliminate the so-called "subhuman (Untermensch)" of the Russian population and colonize the country, mainly empty, with German settlers after having won. /> <br /> Here we have the German army presented as innocent victims and not as Nazi mass murderers. When will modern German filmmakers be honest and face the past? <br /> <br /> We'd better see the Russian movie "Come and See" instead!
