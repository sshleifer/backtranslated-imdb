So I received this from the rental store where I work before it was launched (the release is 8/21), I only saw it today, and now I'm speechless. They may have had a decent movie here, but they ruined it in a painfully obvious way. <br /> <br /> First of all, the parts with John Krasinski were fun, and they are the only reason why I gave it above a 3, but they are broken by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on the life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better as a direct comedy by Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it, because I think Krasinski is fun and I want to see him do it well. The story was not bad either, but not very original. But the direction (and much of the performance) was terrible. I swear they had trouble keeping the faces of the people in the shot and they just followed him anyway. <br /> <br /> His carelessness is shown when the weapons expert corrects another character and says that a "dirty Harry" gun is not one. 357 magnum but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> Then, see this if you really like John Krasinski 2- you like to look at low budget (and poorly-directed) movies or 3- Have too much time in your hands (this is me! )
