I'm not a movie snob. I have liked many movies that critics hate, and I hated the movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with the critics here: "Galaxina" is simply deficient. Clearly meant to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. "Galaxina" has bad photography; has poor special effects; he has a very poor performance; and the production values ​​... well, the games could have been cardboard too. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical item called "The Blue Star". "After a long journey (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at their destination, a kind of alien world from the wild west." There is a scene of painfully carefree canteen (clearly designed to be a parody of the famous scene from "Star Wars"), a chase involving space cyclists and a final getaway. <br /> <br /> The cast tries, but can not breathe life on this turkey.Step Macht and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other films, James David Hinton is quite good as a member of the spacecraft crew, the late Dorothy Stratten plays the title robot, and although it looks great, his role does not give him many opportunities. to act. <br /> <br /> You may see this movie to see Dorothy Stratten, however, if you are looking for a good movie, you may want to skip this one.
