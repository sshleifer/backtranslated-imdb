Once again, Bronson's talent is mostly wasted in this shocking 1984 thriller that (uncut) is much more disturbing than most of what it is today. The fact that "The evil that men do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual representations of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize the last part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same extremely unpredictable and highly predictable plots. You expect this good actor to get up again.
