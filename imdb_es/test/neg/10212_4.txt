Being a wrestling fan, wrestling movies are generally crap (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura), but this is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad, but it's better than some of the others I mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan interprets that he himself is, basically, and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he does not want to. be in that network Let me explain it so that everyone can understand ... imagine that USA Network has Rip ... and TNT will do everything possible to catch it. <br /> <br /> Does this make sense ... right? Well do not feel bad because it does not make sense. It also makes no sense to have a legitimate ex-con who has a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Neither of these movies makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling movies, and then Hogan films his films. It is not too bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
