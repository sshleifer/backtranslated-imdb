"The Hep Cat" by Bob Clampett is a clearly average caricature, but really remarkable for the fact that it was the first color of Looney Tune (previously, the Looney Tunes were all black and white, while Merrie Melodies were colored) . The story of a cat dancing and singing tries to seduce a cat and a dog to a cat to catch the cat. 'Hep the cat' lacks the energy and rhythm characteristic of most of the Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett does not have much to work with. Warren Foster's script is embarrassingly thin and, while it has turned the straw into gold with other cartoons, Clampett does not succeed with 'The Hep Cat'. It is often said of Clampett that his cartoons can not be confused with those of others, and in general it is true, but 'The Hep Cat' is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett's genius, like the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog: "Hey, you're following me." When the dog confirms that it is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the chase resumes immediately. Unfortunately, there is very little brilliance in the program here. Knowing who directed it, 'The Hep Cat' is a bitter disappointment. We all have off days and this was clearly one of Clampett!
