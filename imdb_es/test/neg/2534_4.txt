This film begins in a very promising way, but it becomes a bit complicated and stuck in its stylistic charm. The set designs, the costumes and the music were wonderful, almost as perfect as you can get. But the more I got into the movie, the more I felt that all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not for the audience. Although I loved watching it, except for a few short musical scenes, I can not say that I enjoyed it. The director shows a huge imagination, but if he had fun with this movie, he could not share it with the audience, or at least with me. I did not have the feeling of being a whim and I was not absorbed by this universe. <br /> <br /> One of the main causes of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. It can be said that she is trying hard, but she seems to have been so evil that she is almost amateur. She is a capable actress, but she has her limitations. I have noticed that in his performance he has not yet really reacted with his castmates, a defect that creates a chemistry vacuum. The language barrier in this movie seems to only exacerbate things. She and Odagiri act as if they were on separate planets. She is not a very good singer either, which made me tremble every time she sang, but fortunately there were not too many scenes of that. Odagiri was fine, but it did not make much impression. <br /> <br /> I was not even interested in the characters separately. There really is a lack of painful characterization. The only reason to worry about them seems to be that they are a good looking royalty. However, without the compelling love story in the center of the film, it's hard to worry about what happens. The film also deviates towards minor scenes that added nothing to the story and actually distracted. I had to rewind because after entering a secondary plot I could not remember what the hell they were doing in the main story. There were also scenes in which it was difficult to say what was happening because it was very stylized. <br /> <br /> In general, I was simply disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are many things. Yes i like it. The music and choreography of the dance are really great. The support performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic both in terms of acting and singing. It is a pity that the main actors were so insipid.
