The thesis of Father Brown is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A bit of proselytizing does not matter to me, but this gets a little ridiculous sometimes. <br /> <br /> Some good actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and he does it well for him, but you did not see any great demand for future Father Brown films. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a committed Roman Catholic, everything develops perfectly. judgment. It is much more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than to see that he has been brought to justice. <br /> <br /> But that's what they were asked to accept here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness is trapped in office attire trying to return the stolen items that one of his parishioners Sidney James had stolen during a robbery. <br /> <br /> That's the story that tells the local cops and, of course, this is something that James has. I trusted him so he could not break the confessional. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to a bigger game. The master thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, has stolen a cross that has been entrusted to Father Brown and is said to have belonged to Saint Augustine. But Father Brown is more interested in Flambeau returning to his faith than in seeing him brought to justice. So he cheats the police so he can fulfill his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but all this was too much for me to swallow. Father Brown would hate to say he was guilty of obstruction and should have been arrested. And he had no obligation not to reveal anything of what he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent who sought absolution and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic layman in his time, finds all this very reasonable. Taken to its logical conclusion, we should replace all the police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and from Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown. Granted, although Brown is much more cunning than the other two. There is also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this portrait. In The Bridge over the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character whose rather strange interpretation of the rules made him lose sight of what was important in the situation in which Nicholson was. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is an entertaining companion when he is solving mysteries and making the authorities seem foolish. We enjoyed Brother Cadfael in a medieval setting and the American public liked Father Dowling played by Tom Bosley a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been just entertaining.
