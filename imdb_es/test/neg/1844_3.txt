In general, I am a very generous voter in IMDb and I do not bother commenting on movies that I did not like, but this was silly. In fact, I turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it, to see "This Is It" (because my girlfriend wanted ... I only chose the lesser of the two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie: imagine this movie as a collection of worse than average "horror" stories, such as "short stories of fear" found in a number of "Reader's Digest" in the waiting room of your dentist. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything particularly frightening or funny, I'm not the kind of person "I want to see blood!", but this "movie" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" nor entertaining at all. otherwise. <br /> <br /> It's probably more frightening / funny and entertaining to watch the poster of the movie "Has Have Mail" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7 years old.
