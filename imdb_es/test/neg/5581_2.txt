The type of series films of the 1950s that were incredibly fun while Predator Island pays tribute. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island called Hell's Beacon, inhabited only by the couple who care for the lighthouse. In the typical sci-fi fashions of the 1950s, after half a dozen young adults crashed their boat on the rocky coast of the island, frightening creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hits nearby. The creatures begin to inhabit the bodies of their victims, as well as to devour them. A lot of curses and lame comebacks are the main form of dialogue in this movie. He's so stupid you just have to laugh sometimes. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid, but in a fun way, then this is the right one. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appear in the film as a corpse in the background of the final scene. During the filming they needed about 50 extras, however, around 300 people showed up at the opportunity. Eventually they used almost 200 of them.
