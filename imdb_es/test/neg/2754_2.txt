Make no mistake, High School Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to get rich and get the girl. However, he is wrong and, of course, at the end of the film ends up dead along with some other people, fortunately including the girl. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is that all women care about wealth. Also for us, men, I suppose we must accept that we "have it" or "we do not have it"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated 1, however, it is above the worst of the movies. The performance is not totally horrible, and the production values ​​are not ultra-terrible. Mostly it's a bad movie and it's not worth seeing for many reasons. If you insist, of course, on torturing yourself, look at the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
