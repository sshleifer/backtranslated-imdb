On this site I have often criticized Americans for not knowing how to write comedy, BUT, while they have never produced anything of the quality of 'Fawlty Towers', 'Blackadder' or 'The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin', Also never (in my opinion) have done something as bad as this: the nadir of British comedy. <br /> <br /> On my Richter scale, the horror of comics only compares with the truly execrable. 'as the worst comedy show in the English language, with bad acting, annoying characters and humor that had grown up before leaving elementary school. Unfortunately, it was part of a lot of shows back then, along with 'Dad's Army', 'It's Not Half Hot Mum' and 'Allo, Allo' that were based on ridiculous situations and familiar phrases to keep the audience "entertained" . <br /> <br /> Michael Crawford later proved that he is a talented performer, but personally, I would prefer to be condemned to a month of seeing 'Rhoda' than to endure a single episode of this nonsense, which makes me ashamed to be British.
