This was one of the most confusing movies I've seen. Everything in the film seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been stuck. There's even a talking buffalo that wants to rub his wet nose to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck just to give children an excuse to fly in a cart. It was ridiculous, but in an uncomfortable way due to the serious issues that seemed to be used only to configure the plot.
