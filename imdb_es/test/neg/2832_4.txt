As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the films he has participated in, I assumed he would enjoy Progeny. I did not do it, although in some aspects it has its moments. However, if you are expecting something of the caliber of Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you could suffer a commotion. In a way, this is similar to the Society, it's a story of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrible supernatural milestone ... but that's where it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm not covering Yuzna when I say that the fault really is not with him, since a bad address is a bad address, but the address is the sound. What alters the film is both the script and the performance. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written a clever script, but one that does not really work with Yuzna's directional style, leaving him on pause for the actors who provide a prolonged dialogue when he really wants to throw the camera and crouch with his evil. I. This issue makes the movie uncomfortable enough, but it's worse. <br /> <br /> If the movie had been made with great actors, the film would probably have remained in itself. Unfortunately, this is far from the case. The performance is wooden, surprisingly even for a low budget B function. The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo destroys every damn line with almost exact precision, and offers one of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. Man manages to turn every well-considered line of dialogue into the kind of hammock line that he will throw drunk to his teammates the next time he's in the pub. 'Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, I'M MATURE! WHAT IS ... COME ON ME! NOOOO! 'In fact, I can try next weekend. The last-minute addition of the genre's veteran (and Brad's favorite), instead of enriching the film as it should, almost seems to give Dourif the film in a last-ditch effort to stop Vosloo from attacking, but frankly Dourif seems deeply uncomfortable. (Possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn on his part does not resuscitate the film. <br /> <br /> If the performance was better, this movie would have been fine. have been quite pleasant, but the lack of character makes the film a soulless affair, and makes the element of horror look insipid and insipid instead of an organic part of the film.I found that extraterrestrial scenes of torture / rape are already a bit difficult to assimilate, but the fact that the characters were so deficient made them seem both free and unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant bor in the mouth. <br /> <br /> So if you really like science fiction and have no problems with the bad acting, the pace of pedestrians and a really nasty rape scene, Progenie will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do it, I'll probably never see it again. Once was enough. On the positive side, this is the only science fiction movie that Yuzna has bothered to do, so obviously he himself was not so happy about that.
