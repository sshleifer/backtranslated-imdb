Such a BS movie. It's just a stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a completely BS argument, not related in any way to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team received more money from the people who ordered the film, than they can ever get from selling it. The plot of the film includes references to some of the recent real events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but puts them in such a way that they have nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a brainwashing instrument that helps portray Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of killing someone. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of the USSR instead of Russia when publishing news reports, showing a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting that they are Russian elections, etc. . <br /> <br /> There are also many strange episodes (that is, a character goes through the Red Square in Moscow and in a second it is in the center of Sophia, Bulgaria).
