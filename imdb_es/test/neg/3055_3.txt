When I saw it for the first time, I thought some fragments were quite frightening. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that sleepy teens are so irritating that you really do not care what happens to them. There are some really good moments, like Angela's speech about demons, and the demon seen briefly in itself is effective. But this really does not resist repeated visualization or close analysis. Everything is quite sticky and cheap looking and often, frankly silly, pornography and funny little jokes often replace horror. However, the music is excellent, and the epilogue is certainly fun, but this movie does not have much to recommend, it simply presents itself as another harassment rate and Jason type bar.
