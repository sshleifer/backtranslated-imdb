Once upon a time, Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, not only do terrible movies, but put their names to people like this. <br /> <br /> A supposedly great retrospective retrospective of motorcyclist films of the 60s and 70s, with new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy it when a blouse falls into a movie more than the next man, but I even felt kind. Of poor quality watching this. To use a word, I never thought I would do it, it's the sameist (you see, I can not even write it). The plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as the accent of Vinnie Jones, the fact that his terrible performance does not support that our will is as condemnatory as one might think. <br /> <br /> This is simply terrible. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
