And I still do not know where the hell this movie is going? I really want to say, what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? Is it to prove that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, then it was natural to play the role of Ram√≠rez in the mountaineer? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was used so little? Where was there so much slap on the table? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese boy he was shooting with archery? Did you realize that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), raised in the swamp of Louisiana (Universal Soldier), or by having a French mother and raised in Indochina (I can not even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?
