Give me a break. How can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that movies tend to do a pretty good job: the bad job of portraying hockey to the general public. And yes, this was done when the USA. UU They had not embraced our sport to the extent that it has today, but in reality. I have played hockey all my life and I have seen even more, and this my friends is pure madness. The scenes on the ice were great bizzare ... the particular case I'm referring to is the "sword fight", and I'm referring to the "stick fight" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone is Standing around and observing, not with fascination what is really happening, but wondering who will win the duel between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie. Yes, the history of ice is a little better, it stresses me SMALL. <br /> <br /> I do not know, maybe it does not make sense to continue ... I mean, let's be honest: the movie is Correct. Hockey is just a big battle on the ice ... oh yeah, with a bit of vulcanized rubber bouncing around, occasionally in what's freely called "target." Youngblood is atrocious or hysterical, I can not figure out which ... maybe someone else will have more luck.
