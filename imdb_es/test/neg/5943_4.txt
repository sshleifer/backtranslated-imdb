"Midnight Clear" has a great premise. Incompetent leaders send a group of overly polite and brilliant GIs to a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm on the eve of the Battle of Bulge. The GI meet a group of German regulars tired of the battle, and it is clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> There's the problem. It is really very simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do and that is the end of the film. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that is also the end of the film. So, instead of playing the games of GI and the Germans, they even throw snowballs at any given time. Interesting for one or two scenes, but soon it becomes very annoying. After all, these are Germans. The enemy. Nothing in this movie makes me think that they should not be taken prisoner or shot. The film does not make them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters did made ME want to shoot them, even in a scene in which the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a mere enlisted man! Why should I worry about such characters? Just shoot them and continue with the Battle of the Bulge. Anyway, it's much more interesting. <br /> <br /> A good scene: the GIs are returning from a recognition of the German position, where they had the Germans in sight but did not shoot. As they walk through a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans have their Mausers pointed at them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The IGs then do something that I have NEVER seen doing in a Sillywood movie. They pull their rifles and raise their hands! As unusual as it is in movies, it is a completely sensible reaction to have a rifle aimed from that distance. Although it may seem distant, it is actually a point-blank range for those rifles. I will be very likely that someone who works in this movie is a disgusting one!
