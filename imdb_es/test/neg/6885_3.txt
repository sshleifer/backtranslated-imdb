This episode has just been broadcasted in the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Touches of hard-nosed humor were misjudged, childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good story. I can not believe that Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to happen. I've seen all the previous episodes of this show, and even the episode in which Jack played his own previous self was way ahead of this episode. The lesbian kiss was a pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> There was also no continuity since the previous episode. There was nothing in the story that investigated Martin's dangerous behavior or the possible drug addiction. Similarly, there was nothing explicitly written about Jack's growing relationship with Ann. Usually, Without A Trace is pretty good at this kind of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode should be a considerable improvement.
