Once again, I fell in love, in my roots I want a funny and bloody horror movie, even one of vampires. Even if it's stupid, as long as I have my funny gore in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it does not take much. So I saw the cover of "Bled" in Hollywood Video and I felt some curiosity about what it was, it seemed interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall in love with that? This movie not only did not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my bloody and senseless violence and nakedness, but I was bored. This movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it really is not! I'm so close to going back to the store and asking for my money back because this is one of the few times I really turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist meets a vampire, I think, I do not know, I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I guess maybe he's a guy who eats cockroaches and Do you like to scare people? I think I do not know. Anyway, he thinks that the artist has a certain flash for the dark, so he gives him a drug to go to an alternate fantasy where there is a vampire and needs blood to be alive. I think I do not know. So his friends get excited and decide that they also want to try the drug, I think, I do not know. Then, after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I think, I do not know, and the vampire is now enjoying the will of the girls with big breasts in gala clothes. I think I do not know. But do a couple of girls really end up being vampires? I think I do not know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I do not know", this is possibly one of the worst comments I'm going to write, but that's because this movie was horrible, boring and confusing. I love watching these actors who want to be, and you can say that they are waiters looking for that "great opportunity". It is not so smart as to fall into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes not, in this case, you really should have read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it in your video store. This could possibly have been an interesting movie with its concept of a different dimension, but why did you choose this director to show your "creativity" if you have any? This was a bad movie, just walk away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
