The last video of Wesley Snipes directly to a video film is a complicated disaster, reminiscent of the latest works of Steven Seagal. The script is horribly written and does not take into account the low budget you have and try to be too smart for your own good. Unfortunately, Snipes has also fallen into the trap of having a double voice of ADR making much of their dialogue and a complete narrative that appears from time to time through the points of the film. It is sad to see a kind of Wesley Snipes talent making garbage like this movie, and producing a tired and clearly boring performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It has become a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he does not interpret his own dialogue, but it is not something he would have expected from Snipes. Maybe it's due to the producer, Andrew Stevens, who has worked with Seagal before, or the director Po-Chi Leong, responsible for the bad epic of Seagal. Out of range. <br /> <br /> The plot involves somber government officials, terrorists who train football teams, discs with incriminating evidence and a large amount of money lost. Oh and biological weapons. Now, how they are connected, I do not know, but what I can tell you is that the diabolical script is quite difficult to understand and, like many of these DTV movies, this includes including a twist too. The plot is also told without interest, playing cards with people who have shade in the offices and in the dark alleys, etc. It's like "it allows us to sit down and share some plot points for the sad bastards who watch this movie!" The pace of the film as such suffers because despite the monotony of the performances and the story, the film has some nice action scenes. As an example of how a DTV movie has managed to convey a plot of a twisted nature, I give you the directorial debut of Dolph Lundgren, the Defender. That movie had its share of twists and more complexity, but the movie has a last hour of action almost in its entirety, with Dolph under the siege of terrorists. The points of the plot are counted in the context of the action, in movement, while avoiding death. The film does not stop to tell us what is happening, it does not break the rhythm. As such, although the plot was a bit complicated, it was more forgivable because the action never gave way. The Trigger, like many of these movies, stops everything to give us a complicated tour of who is bad and who is not, before inevitably changing that turn in the turn of the back end at the end. These films can often suffer with rhythm problems. <br /> <br /> The same Snipes as I mentioned is pretty insipid here. At first he is creating a camp personality, since he is undercover with some arms dealers. Initially, it seemed as if he was having fun, but unfortunately the rest of the film sees him and his occasional voice duplicates sleepwalking through paper. Snipes only comes alive when he is called to kick his ass. However, there is a good action here, with some fast and crispy martial arts and some sticky shootings. The movie also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca is a co-star and is not a great actress, but she is beautiful, with a disguise that screams "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast comes and goes with clich√©s and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Snipes has better projects lined up from now on. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he will do Chasing The Dragon, by director Chris Nahon, who made Kiss Of The Dragon by Jet Li. Finally, Snipes is apparently making Toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by Danny Glover. The future suddenly looks brighter for Snipes, but remember that he was paying very well for his DTV movies, around $ 7 million per movie, possibly more. It is also funny to consider that of all these DTV, Dolph Lundgren, of God, is making the best films, addressing himself, with the pleasant Defender and the Russian Specialist extremely violent and well done, and what is more, he is doing with a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings of Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. * 1/2
