This movie moved too far from Straub's novel for her to enjoy. He barely made it to the middle of the movie. In addition to changing Don Wanderly from Edwards' nephew to his son, he eliminated most of the main scenes and several characters that brought the novel to life. What was left was garbage. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. Nor do I believe that the casting did a great job selecting the members of the Chowder Society. I hope someone comes and actually recasts this movie correctly in my life. I hate when Hollywood destroys the works of talented authors because they think their version is much better. Me sick.
