During college, our Philosophy professor, Mr.R, played "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still quite unknown; a charlatan in the process of creation, a name that would soon become a member of the household who was still busy perfecting his de facto skills and still learning to manipulate those who are easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless and the ridiculously credulous. <br /> <br /> When we finished seeing it, I thought: "Yes, it was something entertaining, in a totally foolish way, Bugs Bunny, kind of way, but what is an ultra capitalist and anti-capitalist propaganda turkey that does not have any objectivity at all, its sole purpose is to take photos of people and ideas for which the creator of the film has motives, a documentary by any stretch of the imagination. " However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely delighted with R & M, and we ended up not only NOT criticizing any aspect of him, but Mr. R actually spent the rest of the class praising his "qualities". Just for us to understand each other, the words "propaganda", "manipulation of the spectator", "extremist of the left" or "selective presentation of facts" never left his mouth always smiling ... And just to remind him: this was supposed to be be a philosophy class, DO NOT INDICATE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL BS Of course. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now I get to the really interesting aspect: this teacher, Mr. R, is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left scripts with grade A stars. In them, the moral of the story: that's the kind of people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a liberal Marxist opens the door to almost everyone. Tinseltown is full of rabid pro-ChÃ¡vez extremists, hence the political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been an integral part of the Hollywood experience for many decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace this demagogue and I will have betrayed your own brain forever.
