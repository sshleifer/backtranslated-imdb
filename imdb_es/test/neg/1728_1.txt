I found myself increasingly angry as this movie progressed. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor will hit the earth. The "powers that be" do not believe him, so he proposes to build a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a bassist on his luck. for a tabloid of poor quality who receives advice from a friend, he thought it was dead that something is happening in the mountains. It is proposed to investigate. <br /> <br /> While trying to enter the secret survival shelter, Jake spends a lot of time shooting people to death or hitting her for an inch of his life. He spends the rest of his time talking to Dr. Crawford about who gave the doctor the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found myself wishing that Jake would do the future a great favor. and turns a gun on itself. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this turkey.
