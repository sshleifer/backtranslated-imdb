First, I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II. In my opinion, these two films created and defined the horror genre of Si-Fi as we know it today. I realized that Lifeforce was often compared to the saga of Aliens: after watching this movie, I would not agree. There are some special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line might have been acceptable. I can not beat a naked space vampire woman in the whole movie, this is absolutely absurd (although it looks good). Add a lot of bad British acting and it's almost over. Most of the film ends up taking place in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you will lose the configuration of outer space and any hope of a true action and suspense of the Si-Fi Horror.
