This was a movie based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is Koontz? I refuse to believe that the studio has bought the rights to this film for anything that uses the Genius name Koontz. Since my sight became poor enough to require large print, I have not been able to read this book as I had at least twice a year since I first read it. I missed the book a lot and I could not find it in large print. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that by renting this movie I would at least get the pleasures of my vigilant watchers, but this movie was a farce. Due to the subtle points of the plot, I believe that none of the authors of Mr. Koontz, or the most decent, can be cluttered in 1 or 2 hours of film. <br /> <br /> It will be the intelligent network, Cable or otherwise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multi-part television movie, that is, a mini series, of this book in the way CORRECT! <br /> <br /> one star in five; go lower ...
