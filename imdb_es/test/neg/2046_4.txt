What is really scary about this is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and sexy. Instead, they probably made the most stupid horror photo of the year! <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a group of snobby art friends in a gallery. This European weirdo is approaching and starts talking about pretentious fruitfulness to the main character, sounding like he's just come out of an episode of Dark Shadows. Then she offers him a little stick to smoke (yes, a fucking stick), and she accepts it with enthusiasm! He chooses some red garbage and puts it on a spoon so she can buy it! If this happens to you sometime in real life, do not do it! <br /> <br /> He has transported a strange aspirant to Jean Rollin in the underworld who is supposed to be sexy, but he is not, where there is something that looks like a rotten creature from the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon, she turns all her artistic friends into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how frightened these idiots go and turn blue, they can not leave him alone. In a moment, he even mocks the rotten creature! <br /> <br /> After the final battle and the stupid woman vaporizes or whatever, the so-called hero is left alone to pack his copy of the Michael Moore Type. My country and I can not resist smoking that stick once again to try to rescue your lady friend. What a dope. <br /> <br /> Rate four stars out of pure involuntary humor.
