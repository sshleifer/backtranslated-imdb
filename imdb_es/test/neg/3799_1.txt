The uncomfortable catastrophe of mishmash has a team of scavengers crossing the overturned Poseidon of S.S., hoping to plunder it before it disappears. The sequel to Irwin Allen's successful 1972 film "The Poseidon Adventure" hit theaters SEVEN YEARS LATER! It does not matter that nobody cares more, why give us such a bad production, full of tenuous characters and evil actors, only to destroy the memory of your greatest success? One could end up feeling really bad for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones if it were not for their expressions of loss at sea (good for some laughs). There is a time when Santa Jones is tempted to take some treasures just for her and she timidly begins to fill her pockets, which is an involuntary cry. The film was a professional revolver for everyone involved, especially Allen, who never recovered from this. * since ****
