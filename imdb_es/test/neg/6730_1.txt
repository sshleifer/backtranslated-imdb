I must say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. <br /> <br /> See Seagal doing his fun martial arts with people. I have always been waiting for the Seagal films and, unfortunately, GLIMMER MAN disappointed me for the first time, which I found very bad. THE FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst in which Seagal has acted <br /> <br />. A horribly boring soundtrack, badly edited, the most wrong, etc. Dear reader, do yourself a favor and stay away from this! <br /> <br /> Honestly: stay away!
