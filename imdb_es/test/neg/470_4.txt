I remember reading that Darwin had a fundamental experience in the Galapagos Islands, seeing the wide range of animal life there, and the inmate wrote his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie, it was inspired by the British countryside. It's fine, and as John Cleese would say, right. Nor did I think that Darwin was a man who suffered a deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. According to this movie it was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters due to an illness, but I do not think that the loss of a family member has greatly affected the scientific capabilities of man. Well, I do not agree to ... you get an idea. I think there is nothing worse than when science becomes a fable, and to a certain extent, this film appears as an attempt to discredit evolutionary theory by saying that it comes from an emotionally unstable man, which to me is simply rude. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, fresh and calm, and always thinking with logic. This film seeks to dramatize the non-dramatic and sensational scientific exploration. It's like a Canterbury story. I would not recommend it.
