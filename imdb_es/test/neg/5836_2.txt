Terrible movie Simply terrible The beginning of this film is like the result of a film of bad women in prison. Then it becomes a B movie version of Aliens. B-movie in this case means the addition of free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, and many of the images are exactly the same as those used in two other films of the same company (including women in prison). The only thing that keeps this movie from a 1/10 is that I've actually seen worse movies. Not many, and not much, but worse.
