This movie sucks !! It seems that they simply chose to place the scenes together at random. Good blood, but small plot. Sally complains and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I thought she had SPM. It sure looked that way. The dubbing in this movie is horrible. A scene that the woman talked about and a few seconds before we heard any audio. At that time I knew that my suspicions were correct that I was not from the United States. I tried to follow him, but I got lost halfway and it was very hard to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. It's not worth wasting your time.
