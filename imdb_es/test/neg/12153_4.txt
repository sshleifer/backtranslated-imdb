This movie did not excite me. While on vacation in Turkey, I noticed that I was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the opportunity to go see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story is prolonged during the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not follow at all is how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing that I did not particularly like was the lost segment of Khan's life. He did not go into detail about how the bad guys could find him and put him back in jail after he disappeared for so long. <br /> <br /> In general, I rated this film with a (4) because I enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating since the dialogue left me very impressed ...
