The story is disjointed and badly written. They give us threads and a possible hook in act one, only to see it vanish. If the writer had bothered to read his work carefully, it would have been evident that the initial problem of the character of Madsden and the encounter with the "bad" girl suggests that there will be a problematic alliance between them when they try to solve their problem. <br /> <br /> The problem goes nowhere. The relationship is not going anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs nobody and nobody is attractive. The writing and direction is laughable. You can feel someone struggling with the mess and changing the focus of the story to try to extract some emotion. There are none. The writer / director is simply a beginner whose confused efforts somehow became a movie. From simple mistakes like '... took polaroids ...' - in Japan in 2007? To insult mistakes like nudity for eroticism, this movie is an insult. They can not get much worse. <br /> <br /> And by including 'Madsden' in the talent list, the producers thought they would have some success. It is just acting. Asia certainly is ... and the result is a heroic-chic panto. <br /> <br /> Give it a big miss.
