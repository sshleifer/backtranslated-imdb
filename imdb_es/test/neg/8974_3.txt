Spending some idle time before going to work, I looked at my DVD collection "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" and chose the darker title of the package: Zis Boom Bah, starring a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is obviously the keyword here since most of the titles I have never heard of and I suspect that they are all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie also stars his son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (I just discovered that she is a New Orleans native from the state where I live, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as the owner of a malt shop and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, like Peter's friend. The plot, about a vaudeville mother who tries to turn her rich and carefree son into a responsible with him without knowing who she is, is for the birds and does not have many funny scenes, although I liked the celebrity personifications of Peter and his Dance with Hall in drag And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. However, Rubin is everywhere with his confusion of the American vernacular language of the time and almost everything related to him does not make any sense (although I liked his funny dance). Since this was only 61 minutes I'm sure he played in the lower half of the double bill, I'll be charitable and give him a 3 for the few bits of entertainment I mentioned enjoying.
