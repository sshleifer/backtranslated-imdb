The crazy hikers go camping in the mountains of Utah only to meet a gypsy murderer and disfigured. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a beautiful slasher mill movie, which mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are too familiar idiotic teenagers, which means that one does not really care about them, we wonder when they will die! Not to mention that it has too many corny moments and is quilted with a myriad of images of unnecessary nature. However, it has some moments of interest for slasher fans, the occasional touch of a spooky atmosphere and decent music by Don Peake. Still, it's normal in the dead camper movies. <br /> <br /> There are much better films in this regard, but in general, The Prey can be visible enough for slasher fans. Although one could be more rewarded for seeing Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
