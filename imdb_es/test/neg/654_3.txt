Well, this movie starts and it looks like it's going to be a nice comedy about a soap opera fan completely obsessed. It has nothing to do with reality outside the soap (a kind of inverse of the main characters in "Pleasantville") and escapes to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a nice movie ... but at the same time, it's ALSO a dark, very violent movie, about two assassins who want to kill Betty for complex reasons to tell them here. Any of the arguments could have been enough by itself, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very jarring. I did not enjoy it very much.
