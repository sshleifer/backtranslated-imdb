This stupid, aspiring anti-environment "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, bored, badly bent and stupid. There is nothing that redeems it. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a kind of creature-shark / octopus that appears on the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a bored and stupid couple with a complaining woman and a silent husband who stabs with a fork for some reason). Its ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague edge of something bumpy over and over again. It does not make sense, it's horribly boring, and your conspiracy plot stinks. <br /> <br /> There are camping moments that can not be ignored: the same take of the couple's boat from the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor beat the chest of a dying patient twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, although he is clearly dead; the soundtrack porno-esque; the photo of the couple making love on the beach, with three different themes ("That's ahead of us!") doing this; the old computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a scientist who drinks beer and shouts "I know!" to Dr. Smith; The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears over the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the 'Bots). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is your best episode, but it's certainly better than the movie itself. "This is how I like to go fishing, boys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Cuervo <br /> <br /> A star for "Devil Fish"; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
