STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal- is not as bad an actor as Kevin Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you understand) is a modern Robin Hood (listen carefully, you can listen to the music of Brian Adams in the background ... no, not really), the kind of person who steals Blood money from drug traffickers was illegally obtained and used to keep the damaged orphanages open. But now he has been approached to drive a van away in a Las Vegas heist in one of those last things before retirement type jobs. But, of course, everything goes wrong and he ends the way for the big men at the top and in the jail. Here he meets a guy called (although you would not know paying attention to the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he befriends and ends up coming out of jail. Once free, he is willing to prove his innocence, to find the missing money and, naturally, to match those who framed him! <br /> <br /> Of all the recent Seagal video films, Today You Die looks like that. Above all, he belongs to a cinema, even with a rap star as his co-star like his previous films Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, it seems that when he is not making films about caring for the environment, he pretends to be black and co-stars with rappers. But TYD is not a movie film and it's a luxury that The Great One will never enjoy again until Under Siege 3 materializes (if ever!). <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an aspect Polished and polished that sends attention, but everything goes quickly downhill from there. Once Seagal arrives at the prison, the plot quickly loses its coherence. In fact, the Treach character seems to come out of nowhere without any introduction as his partner, and from there you lose interest quickly. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I've said it before, but I think I mean it this time. I do not think I'll give more of these directly to the Seagal movies at any time. Honestly, I have no enthusiasm in seeing Shadow Man at all. In fact, I can honestly say that until now I have not enjoyed ANY of his STV movies, and Today You Die is not an exception, it is an apathetic and boring effort that is best avoided by everyone. *
