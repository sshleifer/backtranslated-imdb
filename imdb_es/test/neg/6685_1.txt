What a cynical and unpleasant film. Apparently, this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20-year-olds do while crawling on the side of Sydney's nightlife is supposed to somehow connect with their target market. Made by an industry, nobody and friends who apparently thought they could improvise any bad quality behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed miserably at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its clich√© descriptions of obvious and easy objectives that it was rejected completely by the same audience to which it was intended. Moody and cruel, and without any attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience that might be attracted by marketing or casting, SAMPLE PEOPLE could have been interesting or even informative had it not been affected by its exploitative vision of "what that teenagers want to see. " a movie'. The character portrayed by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented filmmakers. It is as if the producers thought that the teenagers would see any ugly garbage and only scenes and characters together that were superficial and soulless. Well, they were very wrong. A mini budget movie made in 1983 called GOING DOWN understood this topic well and is an excellent antidote for this poison.
