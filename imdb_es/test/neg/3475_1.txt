What a mess! Normally, when one criticizes a historical film, it is always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip, usually added by writers to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Imperium: Nerone" is a kind of animal. In this film you strive to find ANYTHING confirmed by the historical record in the middle of the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of the artist-emperor of the bad boy of Rome. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a good movie. The producers of this mess chose another route, which leads only to a head scratch from any informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is represented as a 6-8 year old child when Caligula kills his father for treason, exiles his mother Agrippina and sends child to be raised by slaves in the countryside. "Ten years later", the story resumes just before Caligula's murder. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year reign, and he was only three years old when he was killed; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was banished briefly for bad behavior, not for treason; and Nero was not raised among the slaves, but had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. All right, according to the writers, Nero is now about 16 years old when his uncle Claudio becomes emperor (in fact, he was about to turn 4); Agripina designs the fall of the Empress Messalina and marries Claudio, who adopts Nero. Then he goes to conquer Britain and is poisoned by Agrippina shortly after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, although he is still 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 d. C., two years after beginning his reign. He lived until 54 AD. Nero should have been 31 years old for any normal chronology, but in fact, he succeeded to the throne at age 16. <br /> <br /> History tells us that there followed the "Five good years". ", where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus.This is shown (more or less), except that portraying the Roman Senate as opposed to the good measures of Nero is false. Nero only began when he began to show signs of insanity and began to kill the senators for real or imagined treason. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother, Agrippina, is the controller, who murdered her uncle and After a while, Nero gets tired of his meddling and decides to kill her ... In the movie, he sends his minion Tigellinus to stab her, all true enough, but the reality was much better! Agripina was a survivor, and it was not easy, Nero tried to poison her three times, but as an old poisoner, she knew all that and he failed, then tried to crush her to death by tearing down the ceiling of her bedroom, but that He also failed, then sent her on a trip on a ship that was deliberately built to collapse and sink; as she descended, she jumped into the sea and swam to the shore. Finally, he had her stabbed to death. Now showing everything that would have definitely improved this movie! <br /> <br /> Other mistakes abound: Nero's lover, Acte, was not a childhood slave friend, never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that he has become a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by cutting his wrists while sitting by a lake. Etc etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The sources for the life of Nero are mainly the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory. But the evidence indicates that it remained very popular among ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes where the crowd threw vegetables at him as he left the city to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> WHY did the writers and producers take an intrinsically interesting story with many good things for any movie, and do they DO this piece of garbage? Oh, and did I mention how corny the sets and the costumes were? LOL. <br /> <br /> A star, because there is no way to rate it lower.
