With the exception of the thin shelf in Clara Evans ... this show was pretty bad ... so, why did I see it? Too much coffee, and he had to relax before hitting the sack. Seeing BB switch to his Big Biggest team, it was fun at best, frankly laughable at worst. <br /> <br /> I could have done a better Skeltor and special effects on my Dell. Boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he looks more and more like the Scarecrow of his TV series days in the early 1980s ... the treats in the eyes of women must return to the acting school, although Evans is 40 and plays a 17-year-old (she is about 20 years old) ... the Science Fiction Channel has done better than this ... but for us people who are not going to the bars much more, I suppose we have to take what we can get ... after all, everything that keeps him away from the coverage of CNN, MSNBC and Fox of the 2008 Election this day is a good thing.
