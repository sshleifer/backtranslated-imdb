I could not believe how terrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It is so terrible. He easily gets a spot in my worst 10 worst movies of 1998. About the only thing he had in his favor was Bruce Willis, who should stick to action movies, like a completely emotionless killer who would kill his own mother for the right price . But I prefer to listen to Robbie Coltraine speak American for a week than listen to the nauseating Irish accent of Richard Gere again. But this film is also implausible, unconvincing, uneven, unattractive, unimpressive and lands in the role of Sidney Poiter to make possible a return to the race. One for filmroll-footie purposes completely.
