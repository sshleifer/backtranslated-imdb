Why is it that virtual women of "x-rated video games" can speak by mouth but the virtual champion of fighting games Dante has to use a combination of telepathy and more dramatic facial expressions? I feel that, or, they had to choose someone who looked more like a villain (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyes do not exactly call fear in the hearts of the well ... anyone, except perhaps the casting directors who always they consider him a villain or a heroic 'bad boy'.) Or they just had to let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a disguise that would not make him stand out like a sore thumb when he walked down the street. (But, of course, this is the future and we must assume that the bad taste of fashion is considered the norm).
