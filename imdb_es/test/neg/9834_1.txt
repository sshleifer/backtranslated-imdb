Ok ... for the most part, and with all its quality, this movie was really good for an MST3K movie ... but then they decided to ruin the little goodness that I had about fifteen minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The movie is very basic ... a rich kid named Danny meets a bum called Bix, and the two travel to a small town, where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is very good) Now, the basic premise of this movie seemed quite promising. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romantic movie ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a spooky guy in the city coveting for Carrie ... Now, I know what you're up to thinking. .. Bix fights against the creep and finally decides to settle with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and everyone lives happily ever after ... right? INCORRECT!! Because Carrie is murdered by the threat of the city, because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual nuances between Danny and Bix). And then, the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even though the creeping of the city would have easily been the main suspect. Then, the wicked city confesses to having killed Carrie without hesitation ... (must have felt bad, the poor drug). Then, Danny takes Bix home with him ... that's the movie "happily ever after". Sad eh All I can say is, thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they turned this hockey horse into one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.
