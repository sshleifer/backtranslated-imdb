The title says it all: Ed Gein, the butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> It is not an action packed action movie made for teens with high energy drink content. That would fit into a well-established genre, the kind that some people find entertaining, something like "Halloween" or "The Massacre of the Texas Chainsaw." <br /> <br /> This is dark, slow, Full of chopped corpses, and silently wicked. There are few crash cuts, no shots of monsters views, no high electronic score. I do not know to whom it is addressed: ghouls, perhaps. <br /> <br /> Under the credits we see pictures of skulls, hanging cases, skins wrapped in the backs of chairs, that kind of thing. And they are disgusting enough that I could not help thinking that it would be better if this movie was enough to compensate for this Grand Guignol inauguration. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not. The performance is uniformly terrible, as in a high school play. The script does everything possible to sink below the vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, chases a young girl who cries and screams through the Weir Forest, and wears only a modern bra and bikini, instead of underwear. time. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> The address? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, law enforcement officers discovered an abandoned car with blood dotted all over the windshield. No one. The handsome young sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they look for the victim, who may still be around and living. The sheriff, without any motivation, shouts: "Now, FORGET that! I do not want you to go HIGH MESH for nothing!" It should not be more than an exchange of business-like opinions. Why does the director have the sheriff so angry? Characters of various types listen to radio programs or records that play old jazz pop songs: "Is not Misbehaving" by Louis Armstrong, for example. What is rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. No The radio would be playing "Wheel of Fortune" by Kitty Kallen or Theresa Brewer or, probably, Lefty Frizell. It is not that the dysfunction between music and events adds something to our understanding of what is happening beneath the images. Someone involved in the production just liked the old jazz pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is only so much that can be done with a low budget, but there may be light years ahead of this butcher shop. See "Ed Gein" with Steven Railsback to see an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for corpses, and with a budget that could not have surpassed this by much. <br /> <br /> These comments are based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. That is all I could. If someone finds that this story is well executed and is fascinating in some way, you should try to find an idea of ​​their tastes. It's under mine, and I consider myself pretty crooked.
