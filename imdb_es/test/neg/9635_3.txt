This representation of the popular story of children in the cinema is quite pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the first efforts in the creation of films, but this 15-minute image is not imaginative and is poorly made. "The great train robbery" (1903), which I also mentioned, is much more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see the little long-haired Jack exchanging a cow (2 men in a cow - suit) for a bean hat of a merchant and later a stalk of beans grows from where his mother throws them in the patio (I guess poor Jack got the wrong type). Jack dreams of a goose (actually it seems to be a chicken) and a golden egg, and the next day he goes up the stem to heaven. <br /> <br /> There is no effort to be creative in this movie. The stem looks like a rope with leaves, the giant is just a tall, bearded man in a house with nothing abnormally big compared to Jack and the climax of the movie where Jack escapes with the chicken hen and his golden egg. It is miserable when a stuffed animal falls from the screenshot instead of the giant and then the actor takes his place: he gets up on his feet in an exaggerated death dance like in most of the previous films. The stalk of beans (rope covered with leaves) comes descending from above and rolls carefully on the forehead of the giants. <br /> <br /> Look something else.
