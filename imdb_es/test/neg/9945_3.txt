I've heard a lot about the ingenious camera work and direction in this movie. I thought both were a disaster <br /> <br /> also a truly terrible performance. The main "heroine" in the film is irritating beyond belief, and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. everything he does or says is stupid and, in general, seems to mess people up. if she could fight, I could forgive her <br /> <br /> in general, all the women in this movie are stereotyped 'broads' who need a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are weak witches tied to the muscles, able to save nobody <br /> <br /> this is a poor movie, and I urge you to avoid it. To see something like 'the sword of doom' instead, I hear it's much better than this confusing mess of a movie.
