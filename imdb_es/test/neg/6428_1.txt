Well, this was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it seemed that the preview * was * the entire movie. No plot, no clear story, just a little suspense out of place. It seems that the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear, but there are still gaps to fill. Why drugs? Why the number 11.11? (By the way, when Sarah enters the library, the clock says 11.14) What is the connection to the murder of the parents? What is the role of this woman Rayden? Is she one of the girls or not? Who are those children anyway? There is a lot of material out there to create the best cult movie like "The Omen", but the director simply leaves them lying on the floor without going deeply into the story. Even "the Blairwitch project" was more terrifying than this one. All the gaps that he expects to fill, as in the "Mariposa effect", remain open as the credits begin to roll ... Okay. To the next movie ...
