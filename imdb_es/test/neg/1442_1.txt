Everyone I spoke with said that this movie would be good and really strange, so I thought I would rent it. Halfway through the movie, I thought to myself what the hell was going on and what was the point of this movie. This movie from beginning to end is so bad that even the sick parts of the film did not bother me. I mean, what are you going to find with the next Volcano 2? The return of the lava. I mean that entering this movie is so stupid that the characters are so poorly developed, and even when Robert Englund makes the movie worse, I mean he could be transformed into Freddy Kruegur and Spook. Actually I was encouraging the bad guy to win, that's how bad it was. I mean, look, the father is a cop who did not seem to mind the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most important moments of her life. I mean, if they treated my daughter that way, I would do everything possible to keep the guy behind the jail. It also seems quite obvious that the character of Dee Snyders would turn bad again. This is one of the worst movies of all time, with Volcano and 8 mm. Do not waste time and do not enjoy it ...! <br /> <br /> Rating If there was not a rating on this site, I would choose that, that's how bad this movie is!
