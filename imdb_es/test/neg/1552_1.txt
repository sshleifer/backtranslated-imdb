I only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. Totally stunk! I can not imagine how anyone would think that this is a good movie, even a good movie. None of the characters had ANY redeeming qualities of any kind. In varying degrees, everyone was selfish and petty, or battered and battered personalities who had no idea about the spirit of Christmas (when this happens!) I know Canadians and I like them, but I can not think that even THEY think that This is a good movie. I prefer a sharp stick in the eye than see this offensive movie again. A colossal waste of time and money. Do not believe in the person who wrote the opinion that "it was worth seeing". This person would probably enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia as well. I do not want to be unpleasant, but for my life I can not imagine what this person was thinking. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe he / she was the director or the producer. If so, I would like to ask you to return my money. If your money is important to you, save it instead of renting this piece of drek, or rent something (whatever) more! I'm running out of good reasons to NOT rent this movie. If I were a Canadian, I'd BE AWARE that it's supposed to be a favorite Canadian movie. If so, I would say that those who think they definitely need large amounts of powerful drugs. YECK!
