Warning: This may contain SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch many movies for life and I realize that they are just that ... Lifetime movies. Some are great (really), some are good and others are bad. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the last category. Actually, it started with a potential ... a single, divorced and hardworking mother (who leaves work at 2:00 AM) cuts a boy while driving home and lets say he does not take it too long. Harassment begins immediately with phone calls and increases until your house is broken and completely destroyed. So she goes to her mother's house at night and the next morning her mother's car explodes. This seems to be just a pain in the ass for our heroine who manages to wear underwear and jewelry! So the police put her and her son in a local motel to keep them safe and what does mom do? He goes to work leaving the child alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA! I could not believe it! Then he really gets stupid! And the end made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Pity because he seemed to have possibilities.
