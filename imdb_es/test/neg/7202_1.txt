This is just about the WORST piece of trash I've had the disgust of sitting on. The story was embarrassingly amateur, the graphics were horrible and the acting ... I had never seen a worse performance in my entire life. A kindergarten class could have a more frightening, better written and more entertaining concept than this one. I'm sorry that anyone who wastes the time in this movie, as well as the actors who agreed to do the work. It was obvious that they were not given the right address. Writers must have spent their time in film school in the "back room" playing peaknuckle. Many teachers lost a lot of time in these two. I would be ashamed to admit that I really knew them.
