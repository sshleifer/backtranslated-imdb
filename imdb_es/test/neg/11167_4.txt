This is a rip-off of dirty Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students try a joke on the asthmatic mismatch of the class, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it happens all the time, it's not good if a movie is scary. The actors are pretty good and the girls are cute (after all, they're Asian), so I'll give them two out of five on the Mojave'o meter.
