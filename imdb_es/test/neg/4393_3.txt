A friend and I rented this movie the other day. At first glance, it seemed to be another movie for teenagers, which was also what we expected, being fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It accelerates quickly into something that has great potential. Unfortunately he never leaves the ground at all. We had seen him for something that seemed an hour, when finally, half asleep, I managed to say: "Friend, this movie sucks". Actually, it was only 35 minutes ... The guy agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the movie is just not funny. No doubt it was supposed to be fun, but it failed. He failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me of myself. He had the potential to be what he wanted, and instead ended up watching horror movies and fun at all times. I regret the creators of this movie from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All that potential ... and nothing.
