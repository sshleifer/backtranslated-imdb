Sorry guys, everyone who thought this movie could be a great thing, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard, the film you want to establish is completely ruined by a very simple plot. So simple, that the film does not evolve until the end. I wondered if the plot was not about the action but about the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I discovered that the character was inconsistent, whether it is a professional killer or a brother persecuted for guilt. But the two do not go together, because the child that he tries to guide puts him in dangerous situations where no professional murderer would put himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. I did not think he was acting, it seemed that the director tried to take away some personality that he could not provide. And he did not have to, because his less crazy behavior was scary enough. The only one whose performance was great, was Diane Lane. If it's not her, I would give this movie a star. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I expected to see a well-performed film and an interesting plot. And I completely ruined it with my high expectations.
