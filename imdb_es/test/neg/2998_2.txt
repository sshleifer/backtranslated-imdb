First, the easy part: this movie is pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> It reminded me of "Magnolia". And then I thought "Wow ... someone made a movie even more stupid and more irritating than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to have been made by someone who He learned a lot at the film school but he does not know anything about narration, the elements of the well-worn plot and the symbolism of the hammer are pretty bad, but the dialogue is simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> The detailed comments would simply be a list of failures that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not, the "elegiac" parts are beautiful images of the coffee table with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. <br /> <br /> The worst is that the movie does not show I love the characters, except for a small dignity of cornball in the priest. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe the respect that some people have given to this image.
