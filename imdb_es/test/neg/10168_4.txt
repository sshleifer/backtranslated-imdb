Two years after this movie was made, "The Juror" came out. Do not waste your time on this. See "The Jury" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury", with better acting, better direction and a much more exciting aura about it. William Hurt was not credible as a bad cop, and Armand Assante could not be more different from a mafia boss if he had been dressed in a clown suit. You did not get involved enough with the character of Joann Whalley to be so upset about what was happening to her. Also, the way she interacted with the jury was not convincing or interesting in any way. The role of Kathleen Quinlan as a whore / murderer was not completed enough and, frankly, it was not necessary for the plot.
