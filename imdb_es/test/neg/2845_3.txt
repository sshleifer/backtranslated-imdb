Low-income version of Ashley Judd's Double Jeopardy. Sutherland is too professional to be bad, but what was Brigit Fonda thinking about? Penelope Ann Miller's curse continues (think about it, when has she ever been in a good movie other than other people's money? And I'm not saying it's bad, but all her films fail in some way).
