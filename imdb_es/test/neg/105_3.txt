The Forgotten (AKA: Do not look in the basement) is a very cheap and very old horror movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never reaches anything that is worth getting excited about. <Br /> <br /> The patients in the asylum are shamefully funny, especially Sam and the old lady who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Beware of the bit when you approach the camera, tell me you can look without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now, the gore looks very poor, with the blood of pink in many scenes, so it really does not deserve its place in the list of malicious videos. <br /> <br /> In general, if you're not looking for a fantastic horror movie and you have plenty of time, then it's worth seeing.
