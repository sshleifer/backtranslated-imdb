This sequel to "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer in inevitable comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a theatrical film edited for television, "Mister Tibbs" looks suspiciously like a television movie edited for theatrical release, with grainy photography, cheesy opening titles and sets that look like they're made of plywood. The murder sequence has an evident continuity error: the camera shows two hands drowning the girl, then a shot of a hand in search of a statuette, then a shot of the girl being smothered with two hands again, and finally the statuette going down by the fatal blow. Resolving the case should be easy: find the only man with three hands! But shoddy production values ​​can not completely hide the considerable merits of this film: namely, the performance of Sidney Poitier as the brilliant detective determined to follow evidence wherever he can lead, even if that involves a friend . Martin Landau is also convincing as the activist and preacher who does good and who is suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. In addition to being persecuted for the case, Tibbs is in conflict over his life at home, but Tibbs 'race problems and Tibbs' lack of social indignation are absent here. This is the complex murder mystery that made "In the Heat of the Night" so convincing.
