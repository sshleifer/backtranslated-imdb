I love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the film I knew it was going to be terrible. It was bad acting and too slow. On top of that, she was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes, putting a type of racial, ethnic and other insults has a point, illustrating the fanaticism that exists. In this movie there was no sense in the horrible fanaticism and nobody learned what was being said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a play and a new version of a 1982 movie about a 1950s basketball team. Having this movie before the time would have made a little more sense. It did not translate well in modern times and the writing was horrible. I do not know how the play was originally written, but I can not believe that a film as bad and as hateful as this one has reached TV and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Do not waste your precious time in this.
