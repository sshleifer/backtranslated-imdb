The first time I saw this movie was in a Saturday morning session when I was very young. I thought it was great and I thought about it often. Well, I finally saved it on DVD. It was still very entertaining but in a different way. It has to be classified as one of the most absurd science fiction movies of the 1950s. It seemed full of military archive material. The dialogue is forced and the effects are crude. There is a line of dialogue that had me in stitches. The line that Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a group of drunken friends. Its a classic.
