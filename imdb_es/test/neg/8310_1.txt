Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, a morose early morning riser who hit easy credit and cheap rocks on late-night television during the '80s and early' 90s. I mention it just because there's an actor in Death Machines that looks like THEY who likes to play the owner of an Italian restaurant. It appears in the best scene of this positively terrible and almost incomprehensible criminal drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who cleverly hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) that controls the local union. Our hero (let's call him No Paul from the Diamond Center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of Luigi from The Simpsons ("you likea spaghetti?") And seems not to be impressed when one of his customers complains about the food. No, there are no flies in the soup or hair in the sauce: there is a red Buddha in the paste, the business card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of his possible victims. The Death Machines are bad in any way, and quite boring, which is an even worse crime.
