I saw this movie because Calexico did the score. A real disappointment. Annoying and fashionable scenes, with urban hipsters and their clich√© lifestyles. Stereotyped Mexican culture of the Mexican border (mystic grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in his Mariachi style restaurant dress). A few laughs, but fashionable as you, and lacking vision and basic talent for the cinema.
