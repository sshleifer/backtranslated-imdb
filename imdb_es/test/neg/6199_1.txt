I saw this movie only because it was expected to be another David Dhawan artist. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad comeback by David Dhawan. He made many funny movies in the past that did not make sense but none of them was a garbage bag! What waste of talent and beauty was it? I do not know why the actors agree to make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> There was not an iota of practicality in this movie. Bollywood has the standard and the potential. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in this movie is Katrina, but we do not need to see a movie like this to see it! Being a remake of the Hollywood movie, Hitch it is clear that Bollywood directors can not even make a proper remake. I consider this to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Horrible 1/10
