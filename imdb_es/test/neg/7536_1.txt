I think we're supposed to think what wonderful characters the salt of the earth. Unfortunately, this is scarce and laborious. <br /> <br /> As always with any production set in Newcastle, there are numerous shots of the Tyne Bridge and frequent attempts to show what the great "characters" of Geordies are. The viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set, since the rest of the world cared about Newcastle and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> If you like well-observed, literate and original work, keep it very clear.
