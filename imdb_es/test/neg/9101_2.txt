This movie tries to be an "action" movie, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Steve Guttenberg plays the head of an elite anti-terrorist team that fails (?) in an attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent. <br /> <br /> The story ... the acting ... the special effects ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!!!
