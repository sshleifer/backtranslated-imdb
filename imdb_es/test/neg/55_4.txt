I thought maybe ... maybe this could be good. An early appearance by the Re-animator (Jeffery Combs); many tributes to old horror films; The troma tag on the front? This movie could be a jewel! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring and exaggerated tribute to the horror films of yesteryear. The story is old, young people enter a house, get drunk, make love and manipulate things that should not be manipulated. The oft ?? Here the formula of recycled Slasher film is used, this time with a dead actor that is believed to be called Conrad Radzoff. In fact, the performance of Radzoff's actor, Ferdy Mayne, is the only redeeming quality of this film. He makes the character Dracula style presumed very well. But as for children, it's not that good, since Combs only has a minimal part. <br /> <br /> The film lacks entertainment value, and only presents a great character, and one or two scenes that can get your attention. I do not recommend this movie unless I'm desperate to see something, and this is the only movie that remains in box office success.
