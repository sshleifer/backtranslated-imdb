I have read the comments of other users and I am happy that someone compared it to the original from Kamal called Perumarzhakalam released in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original had a very clear history and there were no gaps as described above about the Indian government. Not having proper records, or even bad shots and shots. <br /> <br /> The story is great and delicate and well described by others. But unfortunately, Nagesh is worth it because his own story is something sad and is nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I suppose you have been affected by the so-called "inspired" Bollywood syndrome. <br /> <br /> At least you should give credit where it should be. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older films, but now I suspect that some of them were original after all. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles if necessary, to know what the address of the class is about and the performance of the class.
