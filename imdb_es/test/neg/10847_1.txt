There is no reason to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons First of all, the acting is horrible. There is hardly a line that does not read badly, but that is not surprising given the banality, stupidity and repetition of the dialogue that the actors must express. It is very badly written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way to keep their characters talking after a certain point and is to have them repeat the most important words in the line of the previous character. <br /> <br /> "repeat" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it for the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In movies like this, you usually know who the bad guys are and what they are looking for. (All the good people have to do is stop the bad guys, prepare a good "Mwahahaha! With X within my reach, I will dominate the Universe", the villain is the first stop in any SF plan), but in this Turkey? - Tell me. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, our "heroes" are a group of mass murderers sent to the past on a Dirty Dozen type mission. They are sent by a fascist totalitarian state to prevent other mass murderers from altering the course of history. The new story would not include the rise of totalitarianism, and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves Earth as a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those practical reports of situations on the screen, just before that the action begins, that tells you who is who and what is what.It is an indication of who the producers are that they think their target audience will be, that is narrated and appears on the screen, simply to prevent the audience from imposing too much tax on their brains doing a lot of reading.) So who are we supposed to be supporting here? I think we are asked to believe that our hero undertakes some kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding while shooting a lot of people, but that does not work like a bow because it shows us that he is a decent human being. Being right at the beginning, when trying to rescue all civilians aboard the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I guess the creators pointed to a deeper than normal complexity in this movie, but they ended up with a profane disaster with more holes in the plot and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your movies SF of average shit. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were nice.
