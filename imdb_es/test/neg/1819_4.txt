This movie would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense film that many others in its genre have been successful, but it is not. It is at best confusing and absurd. When the twists and turns finally revealed themselves, instead of saying "Oh, I understand!" I muttered something like "It's okay ... whatever." In my opinion, when a film reveals a major twist to the plot, you should not have to use a flashback sequence to show that it did provide some advice that would allow the viewer to discern the truth for himself. But this movie has a flashback; and here's the trick: it reappears in scenes that were not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped, unfriendly and completely ridiculous. I feel that the "torrid" scenes of love between the romantic protagonists were the most disconcerting and unattractive I've seen in a movie that was not porn. It seems that the director was going crazy for the love scenes, but in reality they were just stupid. <br /> <br /> And do not even make me start with fucking accents and second-class sets. I suppose the movie premiered in New Orleans, but apart from the aforementioned accents and a couple of photos of the city, the movie could have been in Anytown, USA. UU <br /> <br /> My recommendation: do not bother!
