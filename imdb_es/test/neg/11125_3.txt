First of all, and above all, I take the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is "Chupacabras". I imagine that they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural in that way, but I assure you that it is singular in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Next, I thought that this movie had been made years ago. It came out as one of those B horror movies that I saw when I was an early teenager at home when my stepfather was out of town. Then it would have been a little scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the special effects. The most important 'effect' is the suit used for the chupacabra. Since he is the main character, one would think that some serious money would have been invested, but it is not like that. The shape, color and texture were all ridiculous, like a stupid haunted house in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when the Chupacabras walked where no man could walk. His movement was spasmodic and strange at the moment, but moving on the floor looked like any normal man. <br /> <br /> Another thing that worries me is that there is no animal in the world that is killing everything. Go without taking into account really eat it. The Chupacrabas killed one, then the next, but never seemed to eat the victim. You say: "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> What country is Dr. Pena from? It sounds something like Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think it's supposed to be Latin. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even a Russian could say he was not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers fired round after round for this thing, and they were not making a dent, however, he continued to shoot. I am not a soldier, but is it not necessary for soldiers, especially special tactical forces such as this, to have some ingenuity to carry out their tasks? Would not they realize it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They did not. They just kept shooting while the chupacabras kept killing them and not eating them. <br /> <br /> Did they have to kill the puppy? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this movie, because it was bad. Why did I see all this? I'm sure you've done the same thing on occasion, so do not give me a bad idea. ;)
