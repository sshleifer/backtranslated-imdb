The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral outbreak turned the population into zombies that eat meat. Those who left became "hunters". <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is NOT the worst zombie movie that exists. Among the worst are "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, but it ran badly. Considering the budget with which they had to work, this movie looks very good. I was not bored at all as I watched him. The special effects were solid, although they used CGI once (fat zombie that was shot in the head), but everything else (blood, guts) was pretty good. However, acting is horrible. Our main guy looks like the young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. In regards to the plot, they did not work enough on the development of the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: acting, low budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie deserves 4/10 on my part. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN, then watch this movie.
