I was more entertained to see my wife almost tearing her hair out in frustration for most of this movie. I thought that something that would unite everything would be around the corner of the dairy stable at any time. So I cheated, grabbed the remote control and was relieved to find that it was ending in just 20 minutes. I should have turned the channel. Cute, had potential, but what a disgust!
