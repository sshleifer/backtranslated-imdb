I discovered that this is a very predictable movie to see all this. There was a good doubles job that gave enthusiasm and suspense to the story. However, one had to suspend his credulity on several occasions for the plot to work. For example, despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and harnesses when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually, fortunately they found a spare on board the entire aircraft with Caribbean. According to the plot, drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (I can not think why), according to Daltry, the battery drill could not pierce the vault however , on the roof, they simply had a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to adapt to the equally convenient takeoff points in the hydraulic system of the planes located on the vault. As the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this could be achieved without affecting the control systems or at least establishing hydraulic pressure alarms in the cabin. Accepting this for the sake of the plot takes several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (the voltage will be able to drill before the FED arrives to verify the false alarm), but from the moment that the vault door was closed and, before the EDF had walked a few meters to the second security door, they had cut a squire hole in the ceiling of the vault large enough for them to pass. One can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good spinning, however, what ruined the film for me was when what seems to have been an effort by screenwriters to discuss what until then was an end quite predictable, killed the two heroes (If one can refer to the crocks as to the heroes), Ketchum & Brooks, one was shot and ejected from 747 to 10,000 feet, the other more slippery by the cable between the two planes, the villain Daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable that carries the weight of an adult man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him and dropping him to his death. And yet, in the next sequence, these two without any explanation (however tenuous or implausible) have miraculously survived completely after 10,000 feet and had time to establish an elaborate scam to get the money. The only comment about her survival was for Sophie that her brother is a bad shooter. Do not expect an Oscar nomination for this.
