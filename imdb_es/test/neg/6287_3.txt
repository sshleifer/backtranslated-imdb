Poor old Robert Taylor. Apart from THE FEDS, nothing has happened along the way: this almost surprising blow is a waste of ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of those corny crime detective movies with the narrative of the main character in the whole process. It's usually reserved for comedies these days, but this movie takes itself too seriously! A pity The Australian films, particularly in the 2000-2001 period, have been of exceptional quality in general, but I suppose there have to be some failures. Why even make a movie like this, which obviously is not going to be good?
