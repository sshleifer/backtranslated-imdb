Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thank God | It will be held in three different places, and although it was an interesting idea, it did not really work. Actually there are only two games that really showed up, while the rest is decent, or most of them, quite terrible. There are some entertaining celebrities available, such as Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match is worth the ticket itself, but you can honestly see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. By the time he had done it, and despite the bad finishing, this was something surprisingly bearable, with the crowd really interested. The crowd sings "Bullsh * t" at the end. That said, he did nothing for the race of either of them. The match ends in a double account with them fighting outside the ring. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. It is not a great fight, but it is very entertaining due to the mischief that it entails, and a great comedy by Steele, besides that the savage can fight against a pope and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, to leverage himself. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts vs. George Wells. For a disposable match, this was better than it should have been, but it is too short to make an impact. Roberts wins with DDT, taking out the secondary words of the serpent, which displeases Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. A great failure in my opinion. I was bored without meaning throughout all this, and although it may have been a marketing success, I certainly did not succeed in entertaining myself. Many Rowdy songs are remarkable too. T wins by DQ, when Piper defeats T. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Fight for the women's title. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. It ends too fast, even before it has the chance to start, achieving a record of rapid fall, in what refers to Woman's matches. Moolah wins when he takes advantage of Velvet's lost splash from the top rope <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Corporal Kirchner against Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Great pop for the corporal. Stupid pairing, with boring offensive of both involved, while it is too short to be important. The corporal wins when he hits Volkoff with Blassie's cane. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is quite entertaining, despite all the talent of the NFL involved. It is also worth mentioning for the first appearance of Bret Hart at Wrestlemania. Andre wins when he takes out the Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne against The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. Absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania games of all time. You will not have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers at hand and the excellent psychology of the rings. This is pure fight at its best, you can not call yourself a wrestling fan, if you do not like this game. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides with Valentine's heads <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match up here, with both men performing solid performances. Hercules is a disgusting brute, with abilities above average, and contrasts well with Steamboat's high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body on the top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible party, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a superior rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk brothers against Tito Santana and JYD. A pretty solid coincidence here, with a lot of memorable punches taken from Terry Funk, the one at the table was something else for that moment. I would have to qualify this as my second favorite. Funks wins with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most exaggerated games in the history of Wrestlemania. Hogan can not fight for the penalty, and Bundy is not that good. The violence was brutal at that time, but Hogan's act of superheroes is a bit annoying and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> In a few words. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Wrestling fans should see this once, but they really do not. There is not enough here to satisfy a true fan of the fight. Vince ruined it in this one. Do not be fooled by the exaggerations of the main event, it's really a boring affair, like most cards. It is not recommended, and is ranked as one of the worst Wrestlemania, outside the bright title tag.
