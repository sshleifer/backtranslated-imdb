Oh, how the critics fell on themselves to praise their Goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I never saw the qualities that they detected when I saw this movie in the past, so I saw it again to see if it was wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cold and uncomplicated film about an author who lives / works in a cold abstruse culture. Flat recreations do not attract your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. And the rest just stays there, horrified ... with the soldiers singing songs about masculinity to which they commit themselves, with hair about purity, admiration of swords, etc. <br /> <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you have landed Philip Glass; But then you have to get something out of him. The eyeglass score does not offer a pinch of distinction from his other work, nor does it provide the film with any discernible value. In 2010, it should be clear to anyone that Schrader squandered his career in a job without impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can bore you to pieces and kill the impulse of a movie, faster than any other person. Schrader has made a résumé full of terrible and amateur films.
