Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she really was in this poor excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The film presents some of the worst choreography ever seen related to the constant threat that Lucy could start singing. Your voice bourbon at any time. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and, apart from Lucy's fans, it's likely that no one really likes it. Bad costumes and designs of cheese sets do not help. One more proof that Lucy was not good at anything except making stupid faces. <br /> <br /> Directed by Gene Saks.
