My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The cover looked pretty scary, I thought I would see it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them with friends. <br /> <br /> The first is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him The second is about a guy who wakes up to find a clone of cassarole in his refrigerator. And the third is about a woman who makes online appointments, but it turns out that she has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD case rated this movie with 18, but even a 5-year-old can see this and it can not be scard or entertaining. The movie should have a score of 12 for little scars and the bloody bloody word . <br /> <br /> In summary, this whole movie is absolute, do not approach it.
