At least if you're a Disney fan (well, of the variety that loves your live action movies as well as animated things), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you barely notice that you are an adult, if you absolutely love all the movies that show animals, especially when they do tricks, or if you are not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is something nice to watch. I'm a Disney fan. I enjoyed this movie enough and I will gladly see it again. <br /> <br /> But boy, it has many problems. The main defect arises from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads and little time to take care of them all. In the space of 82 minutes, we have adults who get married, teenagers who fall in love and try not to be clumsy, competition from teenagers for love and jealousy, preadolescents who play spy games, dogs that fall in love, dogs that play soccer, Dogs have puppies, manipulative parents who will do everything possible for their children to win and their children to teach them a lesson, dilemmas of housekeepers and criminals cooking and executing complicated plots. I'm probably forgetting something, but that's 10 big problems to deal with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that is not too complicated: this is child's play. The movie, after all, and that's also humorous and comforting. It's not surprising that director Bill Bannerman, in his first full shift in charge (he has a lot of previous experience in the second unit), was not up to the task. I'm sure it did not help that there were at least three writers involved and, probably, also dictators of producers. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely choppy. The events occur with little justification and, worse, with little explanation. People realize and do things mainly because they need it, and quickly, so that everything can get where it needs to go in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to another, the time could be about six months or so. We have two adults who seem to have mental disabilities and children who simply think intuitively what a dog is thinking and are thrown into unexpected action. Some of the threads should simply have been eliminated, since it is difficult to get too involved in the film when, as soon as an idea is presented to you, it has already happened to you. <br /> <br /> It also does not help. The fact that one of the threads is basically a scam of One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), minus one Cruella De Vil character. And another problem is that given the way the film is edited, I must assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably could not do much with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two films, a dog that practices a sport is almost a late occurrence here, and when we see it, it is in very quick glimpses; From time to time, these fragments seem to be helped even by computer animation. <br /> <br /> However, for someone like me, Air Bud: World Pup has a cheesy charm. The script and performances are often staggering between ridiculous, hokey and a bit clich√©. I tend to like that combination. It makes the film a bit predictable and subtly strange. And sometimes, like the end, when the film completely abandons coherence and basically becomes an ad for the US women's soccer team, Air Bud: World Pup is so blatantly vulgar that you can not help but love it. .
