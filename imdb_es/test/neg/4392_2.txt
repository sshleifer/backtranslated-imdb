I have little or no interest in watching another horrible movie, which totally lacks something creative or funny, abusing the National Lampoon label. As never before, something caught my attention in the cast of this film. I see the name of Danielle Fishel, I am a big fan of encounters with the boys of the world! But the movies are horrible. Moreover, as a fan, I do not feel rewarded for watching his terrible movies with the bare chest treasure. So this is where my question comes in. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, does Danielle Fishel get naked in it? It would save me the 2 hours of my life that I would never see this terrible movie again. Thank you
