The only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows the bands and their music when it changed in NY during '81. As for the film itself, it has at least three major flaws. First of all, there is a narration throughout the film, which is not necessary at all. In the few places where there is some necessary explanation, just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audios; in fact, it is quite evident that most of the dialogue was recorded later without any attempt to match the film. The third defect was in the end. I will not give the end to those brave souls who would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but committing a cardinal sin in screenwriting. It's not worth the money or the time it takes to see this, unless you're a fan of one of the bands represented.
