BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDD. He fell asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe spinning in a hairy Speedo, rent this movie. If not, please do not bother ... Full of anachronisms. Was this supposed to be established in the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age or the Age of Reason? What was the reason for the black nylon wig in the type disguised as Genghis Khan? Was he really supposed to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why did we have to wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? It is never clear where Ator comes from or if he is supposed to be a superior type of being. You wonder if everything was explained in the first movie, but after seeing this, you KNOW that you will never be upset.
