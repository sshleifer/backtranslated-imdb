The fact that a film is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of a film is so threadbare does not mean you should not buy it. This review actually applies to 2 matched movies on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The arguments of these films are of little importance. Are they of interest only to people who collect Holmes movies? Does anyone who simply wants some of the best deals do well in buying some of those made by Jeremy Brett? or, if necessary, Basil Rathbone. Are there some other very good Holmes movies with good actors in one shot? as "Seven percent solution" or "Private life of Sherlock Holmes". In any case, these films are considerably less estimated. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of films with some of the best actors to make Holmes, even if the results tend to be disappointing. This seems to be the only disc with these movies (although "Deadly Necklace") appears only in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) Deadly Necklace" dates from 1962, although it does not sound like it or sound like it. Some of those who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produced by Hammer Studios. It's not that Hammer has not done really deranged things, but as far as Christopher Lee is concerned, they generally did a better job. The print is a direct transfer of a 1: 1.33 copy rather worn in black and white. The quality of the color suggests that the original may have been in color, and the cut ends of the film's appearance suggest that it was originally 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film is set at the beginning of the 20th Century ?? It is not improbable, since Holmes still worked then (and in fact he did not die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted from any real Doyle story. It is an Egyptian necklace, and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-renowned archaeologist and also as the Prince of crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie is that ?? For some unfathomable reason? Hammer filmed him in Germany. Nonetheless, it was filmed in English. Then he doubled up in German and then turned back to English. So, what you hear is not Lee or any of the other original actors, but a lot of unknowns? It's not that, outside of Lee, I doubt anyone knows any of the other actors. This is very bad, since Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskervilles") is a pretty decent Holmes. As it is, his double voice is condescending and simple like the pudding of bread without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music of this film is mainly jazz, in a possible attempt to be "point". Too bad nobody thought of ragtime. As it is, music is not related to what is happening on the screen and is often at odds with the action. <br /> <br /> The other film is "(Sherlock Holmes and) The Speckled Band" from 1931, starring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the image and the sound is totally up to the effort of 1962, and in fact it is a little better. Massey makes a very respectable Holmes, although he certainly does not play the role the way Rathbone and Brett did. It is unlikely that the other actors involved in this production will be of interest to modern readers. The acting ?? As with many movies of this period? It owes a lot to the post-Victorian stage and the silent movies. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that, while "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD by itself, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the previous movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little more to say about this movie. The adjustments seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone). On the whole, it is an interesting curiosity and a sufficient incentive to buy the DVD with the pairing instead of a DVD with "Deadly Collar" only.
