Since I do not have a TV and I had never heard of this miniseries, I did not know what to expect from The Second Coming and I hired it only because of the strength of its plot synopsis, which sounded interesting. <Br /> <br /> My God! (All the word games pretended). If someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen-year-old children who had been entrusted with the project of turning the second into a school play, I would not have been surprised. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did you decide to portray Jesus Mark II as what amounted to a wise idiot? Is there anything in the Gospels that suggests this? Well, an ordinary guy, but a Great Northern Moron. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all Jesus did to impress people were his miracles, because according to this, his preaching assured that hell never impressed anyone. Certainly, without the night in the trick of the day, Mr. Jesus Eccleston would have been fighting without a canoe, paddle or any kind of follow-up. <br /> <br /> And the small gay polemics improvised without wanting, without rhyme. or reason Apart from, of course, Russell greeting his QAF fan base. Jesus appears in the pub to recruit "disciples" (more losers of the North without worm form and, of course, the mode of waiting of the gay writer: the harpy woman, complained, annoyed, complaining). The rights of homosexuals sink in their throat without any real purpose, almost as Russell thought he 'owed it to the boys' to put Jesus in place. <br /> <br /> I really can not see the real Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing against personally, friend". Only someone truly middle class and shaggy could imagine that Jesus was so wet. <br /> <br /> And do not start with the ending. "Please, come in and eat poison for rats because the only way we can be truly free is if God dies." <br /> <br /> It was like a sketch of Eddie Izzard of God like Bill Gates. "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global domain is hindering your style, I'll give it all to you, my clients." And he eats rat poison, of course. <br /> <br /> IMDb classifications often disconcert me, but the high score in this case takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> It does not matter to Jesus for the new millennium: this is Jesus for the brainless MTV boys. <br /> <br /> God really helps us all.
