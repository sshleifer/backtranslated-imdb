When I finally saw this movie recently, it turned out to be exactly what I thought at first sight ... another Hollywood CG / live-action replay of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable at all. Designed in all possible ways to attract very young children and very immature adults, making intensive use of comic devices like farts, poop and the size of Theodore's ass. <br /> <br /> This movie would bother me much less if it were not such an obvious step for the Chipmunks. Even his characters that I found were changed for the worse for this movie. While in the past each of them had a very different personality, here everyone behaved like immature, intelligent children with ADD, who constantly bounced erratically on the walls. It bothered me especially to see Simon represented in this way ... He is supposed to be the intelligent and serious nerd who acts as the "straight guy" of Alvin's crazy pranks. But here is a carbon copy of Alvin. A joke in the movie even implies that Simon only * thinks * that he is intelligent but that he really is not ... and honestly, if he had never heard of the Chipmunks before watching this movie, he would have accepted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just another obvious take of cash, and I regret that it was done. The fact that it is a "children's movie" does not justify its flaws ... Excusing a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it's for children is an insult to children, and any child deserves something more intelligent than this movie .
