What movie is this? A horrible movie with the old and boring concept of infidelity that has already been achieved in the "Bhatt camp". The film stars EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI and DINO MOREA. The movie has "No Base". It just happens like this ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However, Dino does not like Udita at heart, since he only wants his wealth. He loves another person (Tara Sharma). So he bribes Emraan to have an adventure with Udita so he can catch them and finally separate from Udita ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ NUMBER !! However, Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is imprisoned for killing Emraan, Dino tries to save her pretentiously, showing her his false love. Udita, on the other hand, does not understand this and feels that she really loved her. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. Finally, Dino leaves the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What fraud! The songs are good and they are the only good thing in the movie. Now the individual grades: (of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 General performance: * 1/2 Address: * * History: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final grade: * 1/2 Deficient performances and poor distribution ... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Do not waste your time !!)
