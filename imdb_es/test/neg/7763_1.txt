"Sex and the city" has some great things going for it. The problem is that it is loaded with a series of negative aspects that really damage the final grade and the revision of its 'six seasons'. <br /> <br /> The good thing about "SATC" is that many of the conversations are true. Life, romantic stories are interesting and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that few women act like complete whores. These four women have so many couples, they even go lesbians in some episodes, they have no choice but to roll their eyes at the absolute absurdity. The men on the show are for the most part represented as shallow, degenerate, liars, cheaters and buffoons. The obscene language these women use is far superior to what normal conversation implies. Why do writers do these things? Clearly, be exaggerated and get your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling me) is how some of the relationships ended. They just did not sound real to me or to others with whom I discussed this. <br /> <br /> But, even though I gave the program 2 stars, in the end, I'm glad I saw the program. In fact, I've seen all the seasons several times. I recommend the program to anyone who is not offended by profanity and soft-core pornography. I could have done less with offensive language and nudity and sexual acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well.
