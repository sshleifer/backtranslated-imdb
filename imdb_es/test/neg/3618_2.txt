Usually, I like movies about animals or reptiles that turn against the old humans that threaten their environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting, a group of people, including an enthusiastic writer played by William Katt, goes to an island called duh, you guessed it "Island of the Serpents", and guess what the island It lives up to its name. That is something that I will give to this movie, there are snakes, MANY and MANY snakes of all sizes and types. So part of the justice film lives up to its name, but the writing, acting and direction is SOOOOOOOO. It is almost painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unpleasant that I was begging for the Serpents to kill these horrible people to get us all out of our misery. There are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that you can see them to believe them: snakes spinning to really horrible disco music, while 2 women dance half naked together and a scene with a snake holding an inane dialogue with one of the actors. It is more than absurd. I think the writer was trying to be funny, but this was triggered as a strange journey of LSD ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt years ago when he starred in "Carrie", which piece of heartthrob was .. It's not that I've ever been an important star, but to be reduced to this crap, I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague unless you're really interested in a lot of movies. Serpents and really horrible humans.
