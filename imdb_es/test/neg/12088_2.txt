The governess was, by far, a very unfortunate film. I do not use this word lightly, since it honestly was a bad excuse for a movie. I finished seeing this function with only one word in my mind? "why"? Honestly, you can use this question at the end of each scene in this movie and it seems to fit. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) that, ultimately, led to a very confusing movie with actors who reviewed the movements instead of giving an explanation. The scenes would occur without prefiguration, understanding, or lead to a complete ending. It was as if I was seeing several different ideas together without any resolution. The actors were setting in motion events that did not seem to fit their character or that were really resolved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and absolute lack of structure of this film caused all the spots on the base to collapse with a "domino effect" that was felt throughout the rest of the film as a result. <br /> <br /> Let me explain myself more thoroughly about this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would compare this film with a bowl of oatmeal with lumps that had a zebra in it. It did not make sense or there was no logic behind everything. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this fact. The lines of his character were drawn very blurry and almost transparent. She did things like talking about sex all the time with her sister, but, nonetheless, she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. She has her first moment of passion in this movie, and there is no pain or emotion. It happens in a carefree way, and this just did not seem to fit into the original conversation we had at the beginning of the movie with Rosina and her sister. Is she a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants to have all the rights of her invention? That was confusing and completely random. Is it not obvious to anyone that their teaching methods did not exist? Any sane person could see that she was not teaching Cavendish's daughter anything. The sudden and awkward relationship that forms at random between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost made me laugh out loud. I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this movie when Rhys-Meyers literally "got into" the scene and suddenly caused unnecessary drama. I felt that the director (or writer) thought that the original story was not going anywhere fast, so by adding this random character we can move the plot a bit (or confuse movie enthusiasts). Well, he did not fool me, I saw that he was almost a "cut and paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Do not make me start with the ending, which was not consistent with the rest of the story. Once again, using the "cut and paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to finish the story, and this was the only solution they could reach. Is it sad when actors are forced to do things out of place? But I guess that's the name of the game in Hollywood. Repair it until it is completely broken, or at least it can be rescued. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was an interesting little dribble. Maybe there were a handful of good cinematographic moments in which you could see that there was a bit of creativity trying to reach its peak along with some decent music beats of the time, but nothing about writing to the grandmother. A more familiar structure with some stronger introductions might have strengthened this movie a bit more, but as I said before, by leaving the scenes open around the whole movie, you will experience a crack in your base. What may sound like a solid story will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this movie I felt the house was collapsing on top of me. Wilkinson interprets his normal personality in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to undress, but everyone else did (I'll have to see a doctor after those images have burned in my eyes?). In addition, she wore the same dress every day. That was disgusting and I could smell it on television. Sex and dirty clothes. Now there is a great movie for you! It seemed like there was some potential floating around here, but instead it was just garbage. Nothing was answered, the questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme. <br /> <br /> In general, this could have been a decent movie that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was simply regrettable. I can not emphasize enough the disturbing fact that the characters were going through movements without any prior explanation. I do not need the cinematic moments to happen to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will fully understand the movie The Governess, whereas if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal. Then, maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of *****
