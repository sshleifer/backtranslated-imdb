Now, I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Bang", but I can not believe that Shane Black wrote this stack ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I designed it for a film festival. Horrible. Everyone was laughing. He is a preacher and a strong hand ... not to mention stupid. In addition, it is surprising how little it resembles L.A. Cambodia. The idea of ​​time travel through post-traumatic stress disorder is a bit silly. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (used to be the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by the director of the second unit of Michael Bay. That's bad. The 2 stars are based purely on the production value.
