As a "fan" of Genghis Khan I expected this movie. After devouring the epic novels of Conn Igguldens on Genghis and reading a lot of historical records, I feel that I know something about the subject and I was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends through this film ... <br /> <br /> That turned out to be a deception. This movie is practically made from beginning to end. There are some things that seem right, but it's mostly just making the writers believe. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment, like any other person, unfortunately it's pretty boring. Nothing of greatness appears in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you know something about it.
