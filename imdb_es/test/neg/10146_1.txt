In my opinion of this movie, the full part of the video of this movie was absolute trash !!!! However, the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized that the music was a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written. and I'm curious to see what they think of the rest of the movie fans, if I can remember that, I'd appreciate the feedback, I collect old movies and soundtracks from dark movies. It is a pastime that consumes a lot of time but is very rewarding. I have seen this band music sold in Germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album. Not bad Hugh?
