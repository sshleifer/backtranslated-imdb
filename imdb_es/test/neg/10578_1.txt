I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I am 20 years old and this movie was too much for ME. I could not imagine taking a teenager, preteen or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally deceived by her PG-13 rating and the previews I had seen for her. Originally I had seen breakthroughs on Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I just do not remember the preview correctly). In addition, Drake Bell (the main character in the film) stars in a Nickelodeon television show that focuses on pre-teens and young teenagers. I did not really think that the content of the movie was as risky as it was. I should have done more research on that before I left. However, I hope that parents read this movie before taking their children to see her just because she has Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, DO NOT take your children or teenagers to see this movie. The grade should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, references to medications and disturbing events throughout the film. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes involving men who grab women's breasts, a lot of blasphemy, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people are stabbed, beaten and wounds in the movie, and an old woman and her dog are smashed. There are tons of other offensive and nasty scenes throughout the movie. It was really demeaning for women in general. The movie is about the people who made the Scary Movie series, so I should tell you something there. Remember that watching movies like this one can give children and teenagers all kinds of misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and adolescents can not decipher between parodies, comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this movie is typical of its genre. But I find the possibility that children and teenagers watch this movie HORRIFICATION. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the film, I did not think it was so original or funny. He crawled in parts and part of the humor was forced and painful. The acting was not too bad, considering how bad the script was. If you are an adult or an older teenager looking for a fun movie, skip this or rent it.
