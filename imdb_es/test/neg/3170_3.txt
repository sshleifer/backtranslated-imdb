I do not usually consider shutting down a movie unless it's REALLY bad. Homegrown is a movie that I would have liked not to have turned on. The plot is interesting, but the acting and writing are too serious. I did not care about the characters. Any film that has drug use and free nudes as its highlights is not worthy of praise. The characters spent their time taking drugs and believe me, that's the only way to sit through this movie.
