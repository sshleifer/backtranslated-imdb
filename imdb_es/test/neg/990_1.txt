This is possibly the worst movie I've seen, it was done horribly, it did not flow, it was very choppy, because a lot of people did not understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I had an idea of ​​what was happening, that's fine, that's how a child stole someone's car and, while running away from the police, he concludes, for some reason, the police left him and had to face his parents sent him to live with his uncle in the desert, there he meets a girl who loves to climb, gets into sports and has to beg his uncle to allow him to participate in a contest to climb , and that's it. It's like I said horrible movie.
