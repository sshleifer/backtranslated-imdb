This was one of the slowest films I've had the distaste of sitting. After the introduction in which we are given the background story of "something" killing a couple of people on a farm, they introduce us to a white family that moves to a farm - AND NOTHING HAPPENS for a long time. Then they meet this bum who helps on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for a long time. Then, FINALLY, the girl in the family has some conspiratorial stuff. Then, something else happens, the vagabond guy goes crazy and the movie ends. In the middle it is about how this family had to move because the girl got into trouble at home and they have no money and it is SO POORLY that I could not worry about these pathetic people. I can not believe I really went to the theaters to see this! This movie not only reeked, but a $ $ hole responded to his cell phone, the imbeciles were making noise And the movie stunk. THAT IS WHY THEATERS SUCK: the bad movies, the expensive food and the idiots in the movies. I stay at home and I watch DVD from now on, I could at least smoke if I was at home while watching this stupid movie. Stay at home and make some cake instead of going to a theater to see this piece of typical garbage. Stupid stupid shit.
