Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book amazing. When I read this book I had all the scenes totally drawn in my head and I knew what each character looked like. This book had many pieces and when I finished reading it, it seemed that the puzzle had been completed. After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I saw the movie, which was a mistake. The film cuts out so many substantial parts. For example, in the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come and fix her boat. This was a great source of uselessness. In the movie that part was left out. The movie added more parts that were useless and did not make sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. What was the purpose of that scene, other than making the audience feel sorry for the monkey? It's as if the scriptwriter did not even read the whole book and just put the parts he read in the movie. If I had not read the novel before I saw the movie, I would have been completely confused. The book was amazing and is really a classic in American literature, but the film could have been nominated for the worst Razzie Awards movie.
