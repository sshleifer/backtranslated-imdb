This movie was a complete yawn that took forever to get going, but never really did. It was just boring to see it, in fact, I could never really get into that. This movie is not a horror movie for a stretch of the imagination, the cover of the video tape became one. Instead, it's a suspense movie with some horror elements to make the movie more interesting. Of course, it does not help this movie at all. Almost all I remember is that this movie was like a movie from the 1970s called "The Deep". A lot of looking for treasures, rival groups of that kind of thing. There are also supernatural turns, but to tell you the truth, I got so bored watching this movie that I was knocked out, so I really can not tell you what the supernatural elements were. I remember the footprints at the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was a kind of living death, or maybe it's me thinking about the movie "Zombie" by Lucio Fulcio, since it was a horror movie that was taking place on a tropical island and as extravagant as it was that it was much more entertaining than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover.
