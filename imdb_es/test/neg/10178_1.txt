First of all, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that every person has the right to believe what they choose. But I can not imagine how stupid a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. You'd better use it to feed some hungry families in the third world countries. I do not want to talk about the acting in conversation or the plot of this "movie", because I could not find any of those in this. The story is simple: two reporters, one (A) is an atheist, the other (B) has for some reason abandoned religion. B regains his confidence in religion and teaches A a lesson: believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and is repeated until the end of the movie. People, do not create the rating of this "movie", read the reviews first. I did not do it and wasted an hour of my life: (PS: Why is it classified as science fiction?) Because of those few strange sounds and a little bright light from heaven? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil deeds? :)
