... because this is another dead one. Lifeless voice acting, second-class animation, songs devised and little fun (although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of Tim Curry), and a weaker argument than Land Before Time 99: Fossils On Parade. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have not seen the first movie. I'm not a big fan of movies related to heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. Still, I hope to see the first one soon, since there HAD to be a reason why someone would create a sequel as terrible as God. <br /> <br /> If I did not get this movie for free, I would not. I do not have it at all. For a 'sky' movie, the only good thing about this was the devil. 2/10.
