This is one of the most poorly made movies I've seen. One has to take something for Truffaut in earnest; It is not just a B-series movie produced by pirouettes. <br /> <br /> Evidently, Truffaut could not decide if he was doing a noir or a sentimental girls movie. and neither does Deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply incredible, not even badly acted; It just did not act at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person like Julie / Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; The paper absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. Belmondo's performance also suffers, although his character is not as incredible as Deneuve's. The end of the clich√© (which I will not describe) is unfortunately very appropriate for this complete error.
