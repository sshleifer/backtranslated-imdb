Many questions arise about the making of this film. The first of which is: Why make a film that represents so little more than a strange female fantasy? It is one thing to leave the audience with problems to discuss the intention of a film, it is something completely different to enter the process of writing a script that does not adequately solve real human problems before they are shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Why the scandalously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack? Why the excessive and often clumsy dialogue? Why is the main character's girlfriend one of the hooded kidnappers? What is the purpose of converting the freedom of the main character to kidnap in a joke by completing his "mission"? (This is a classic moment of Little Aussie Film - use the quirky comedy at the most inappropriate moment). Why so many scenes where nothing happens? (This represents approximately 15 minutes of the movie, which are at least 30 minutes too long). Why, if a man is imprisoned for so many days, does he make an effort to seriously try to escape? <br /> <br /> The Director, who co-wrote the script, has failed in many ways to deliver a satisfying story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
