Like many movies that involve young children, this starts off as "very cute" and enjoyable ... and then, after about half an hour, it becomes the opposite. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the case here. This story of time travel (which I generally love) where an adult meets a child who really has it at the age of eight. A great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but ... <br /> <br /> The boy "Rusty" is a smart and gray-haired boy, and Willis Rusty grew up now while "Russell" becomes scorching With his constant screaming Is that entertainment? No thanks. <br /> <br /> The young Breslin has become a very good child actor, participating in several films, including "The Cat In The Hat", along with a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> In general, a disappointing film, especially with all the good press that this film obtained when it was released.
