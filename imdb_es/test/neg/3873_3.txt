The original title always seemed like a pretty exaggerated definition for a bunch of cheaters with weapons. Still; his presence on the screen was at least underlined by a group of high quality actors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars in their own right. <br /> <br /> However; this first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now largely composed of players from list B and C, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar configuration. Brynner's 'Chris' had to recruit another team of cheats with guns to solve the problems of the Mexican peasants again. Another tyrant was giving them pain. <br /> <br /> With the originality and freshness of the first movie that was now spent, this remake had little more to offer. The budget was obviously very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the script that is below par, which took much of the previous classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than the original John Sturges. However, we still had a repetition of the agony and moralization that sometimes made even the first one get a bit turgid. However, here there was no decent work of action, action or location to balance things. The cinema was less expansive. It failed to convey the wide range of landscapes that were a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> In general; he just lacked imagination. The first film was a resounding success, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently organized in the fastest and most economical way possible to cynically capitalize on previous success. And that shows us. There is a feeling of "made for TV". <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
