The only reason why I did not erase this movie after 20 minutes is because we already lost 20 minutes in it ... <br /> <br /> the only one and I repeat that the ONLY effect they used is a strange kapoera (from? India?) Jumping on a half-meter wall / garbage cans, I mean, the effects do not make a movie but ... geez ... my friend and I hope that the whole movie has some real effect (a huge wolf something!?!!!) but noooooooooooooooo ... all we have is a jump! in a wall of 0.5 meters + used pharmacies ..... and found weapons?! in the pharmacy ?! I mean, what the hell? Oh, I forgot, there was another effect: contact spears like green eyes! Every 10 minutes we shout "the only thing that can save the movie from misfortune is a giant wolf that kills them all!" Moreover, the script was so horrible that you do not know who you would like to die first. I mean PRAY!) so that the "good" kid dies, hopefully at first. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters to remove the movie from all the archives of the world.
