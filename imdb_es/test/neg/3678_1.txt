I do not remember the worst movie I've seen. A total loss of actors and audience time. If you prefer to be sitting next to your TV and think about when this movie will end, then this is the right movie for you. Maybe this movie is recorded. To make people believe that Moscow has a mystical past. But I must say that I have not expected anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I've expected more from Vincent Gallo. The film lacks plot, character, development, outcome. The intire film is about underground tunnels and how they are mystics. I must be. There is just some camera effect, but even that is too poor. Again and again are the same images. A total loss of time.
