To be fair, it has been several years since I saw the bile committed to the celluloid known as "Here on Earth," so forgive me if my memory of the film is somewhat vague. I will continue with the main points that plague the soul of the unfortunate spectator. <br /> <br /> Scene one: Chris Klein, after being kicked out of high school (because he looks like a seventeen-year-old boy) yes, very credible), gives what I suppose is his valedictorian speech. .. to a field. Let me repeat that for you - a field. I think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he can not express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. It's a decent-looking piece of cardboard, but little else. <br /> <br /> Scene Two: After some games of pirates and teenagers, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett cause some damage to the local restaurant, which is forced. to rebuild. Of course. Because, who better to help with construction than a random jerk who crashed into her in the first place? Better yet, let's say the moron moved to Josh Hartnett's girl, Miss Sobeski, the girl he likes ... his delivery of equally wooden lines? <br /> <br /> Scene three: the character of Chris Klein is kissing with the character of Leelee Sobeski and decides to name his different body parts after the states on the east coast. My soul cries. Really, how can this scenario come out right? Surely you must take away several million people if you imply that your home is equivalent to the most ... erm ... female areas of Miss Sobeski. Second, name your breasts after New York and New Jersey generate some confusion about whether Ms. Sobeski is really disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Scene Four: Leelee is running away. She falls. This gives her ... knee cancer. "We always knew he could go back," says his father (?) He says. Right. Knee cancer Tripping. Maybe I missed something. As I said, a few years have passed. I'm sure I've missed something. I did not do it? For God's sake, please tell me that the girl did not get KNEE cancer so she would not fall. <br /> <br /> That scream you just heard was my soul dying.
