I have to go with my boy Allen (who also reviewed this movie) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is titled, I suppose they left aside the "NINJA" part after realizing that there is not a single "ninja" or reference to the ninjas anywhere in the entire film of the movie ...) is a total waste of time. Honestly, one of the most boring and delayed "movies" I've ever had the displeasure to see. <br /> <br /> A prostitute is repeatedly raped (without graphics) by two zombies, and then by a police officer (again, not graphically) when the police do not believe her story. Meet a guy who was hit by those zombies and the two try to find a way to seek revenge among the undead culprits ... <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no "gangbanging" (or really another ") hits "at all) to be had in ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I was hoping to at least get some kind of horror / porn hybrid at the TIME of DEATH, or RE-PENETRATOR, or maybe PERVERTED STORIES, but no, there was absolutely no sex in this movie. At least a little 'the old man' could have redeemed this boring garbage to a certain extent, but without it, we'll get a lot of badly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero benefits. I am in favor of "junk" films and most other materials, gore, pornography and exploits, but this honestly sucks in every way possible. Save your time, pass this one up ... 1/10 (and the one is only for a few short shots of some sub-par titles ...)
