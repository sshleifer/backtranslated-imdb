The second-year effort of screenwriter Steve Tesich (which follows the incredibly overrated) is a compendium of clich√©s, coincidence and melodrama. Maybe he lived some of this; If so, I regret to say that he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of them convincingly. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done a remarkable job in the past, has not helped much here. (BONNIE AND CLYDE, SMALL GREAT MAN), but does not inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich's narrative. <br /> <br /> The cast is fighting as best they can, but it is fraught with weak motivation and dialogue. The sympathies must be reserved especially for Craig Wasson, whose grumpy performance portends the imminent rapid fading of his career as a protagonist, as well as the shameful Jodi Thelen, badly regarded as the extremely unlikely 'femme fatale' of the film. > Everything seems longer than it is, and the points indicated are heavy and obvious. See Arthur Penn's previous take on the theme of the 60s, the graceful and elegant restaurant ALICE'S RESTAURANT; It's all this is not.
