The history and experience of the last two decades have shown us that intellectuals who talk about sex have to do with the sexiest and non-intellectual thing that anyone can do, but this was not so obvious in 1986. Basically, the idea in this movie is that these The insatiable drive of the characters to find comfort, safety and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves, that they hide themselves with more sex. This impulse is linked to "the decline of the American Empire," as expressed in an early interview within the film. <br /> <br /> So, the idea is that relatively obnoxious people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. At the very least, Arcand continues to give him momentum and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in individual frames, revealing their maximum loneliness and cutting quickly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than with others. They agree And to give credit to Arcand, this is more or less what is the intellectual life, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to excel, even when everyone knows that to excel means to be alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and actions are unattractive and pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something that should last, which makes it a little outdated. It is also the exact kind of mental improvement in dialogue and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes artistic films so unpopular with populist spectators of entertainment. In general, I'll take it anyway, it has its place basically between the exact type of people the characters are, it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone other than those characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
