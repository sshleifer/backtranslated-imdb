Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is "nott" very good. I sat down for the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and the camera work is bad. As I heard there is a download of this movie on the Internet, it's worth the bandwidth. "Even". <br /> <br /> Until the moment I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie. It was an 8.5, which led me to see it and there was a high average of 10, obviously voted by liars and liars. This movie is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this horrible movie, ask them to sit down for Halloween.
