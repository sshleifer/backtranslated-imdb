The door of hell has opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has disappeared into the tunnels below the city in an attempt to find the front door. Wandering underground, he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels, both human and demonic. A good idea with a good cast of second-level actors is nothing like the tunnels that make up. I've seen this twice and I still have no idea why this is supposed to be scary when a lot of things do not happen other than people who talk about evil and we see shadow shapes. Nothing is clear and, honestly, I did not understand the point of all this, apart from providing a paycheck for those involved (the second billed Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that are not much more than allowing him to be billed like in the movie.) The idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script is not going anywhere. Follow the advice of several of the characters in the movie and do not cross the river to see this.
