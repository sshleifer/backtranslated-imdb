French cinema sucks! Down with all these psychotic visions with their distinguished attitudes of God, it's me! Pestilence to the cocky cinematic symbolic language and waterproof chiffres! I will not have a mind for that anymore! Léos Carax, did you ever think that a dialogue in a movie could be natural and vivid? Maybe I'm too common to understand you? Or has it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a Frenchman that the world can have? Guillaume, the one who is going to be guillotined, comes to his house-palace, Mme. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "Here I am, darling!" At this moment, I knew, that she is in the bathtub, and we will see her lying there soon. Do not get me wrong, I'm not prudent, and the incestuous sex scene was the highlight of the movie. But this is, in Berlin, we say "Etepetete", which means something like "être-peut-être", a snobber, satisfied with himself and, worst of all, often seen in French films that I can say. Another example: she, beautiful and willing, looks at herself in a mirror, combs her hair, and her young wild-beard and dirty guru rushes into the room, screaming breathlessly: "There's no escape, there's no escape escape!" Forty years after Sartres and existentialist consorts, what's new, what's so exciting? My God, there is that woman and she loves you and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? And when you're not, please explain much better, why? Born in French means you have to live a life in extravagance, not escape, is that the point?
