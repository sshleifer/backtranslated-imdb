Hi. I watched the first part when it came out, and I do not remember leaving such a bad impression on me like this. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is choppy, made of wood, it is not worked, it is not natural: I understand that the style of drawing should be of some Atlantean type, but it could be done with the usual delicacy of Disney .. see "Tarzan" to see what I mean. If I did not see the DISNEY logo at the beginning, I would never say it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old mission. Not that it was bad, but lacked a story that links the viewer with the characters and their objectives. It was unconvincing, at least. The film was aimed at children, but sometimes it was too childish. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the music ... I would say that it was improper, but that it fits in the whole scene with the plot and the animation. ... <br /> <br /> In general, I think this was a kind of fun, just a kind of project in charge of several apprentice animators, just to complete the counting of the Disney films. I'm sorry to hear that from me, a great Disney lover ...
