I'm sure there's a documentary among the ruins of this festival of yawns somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon becomes a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although due to the bad history that flows, I am not really sure what is happening to them and what the consequences of whatever they are trying to do are. History and faces jump so fast that it is very difficult to fully understand what is happening. The 3rd founder who takes them for $ 700K is introduced so late in the film, Khaleil and Tom have to make a copy (unsuccessfully) to explain "oh yes, this guy also created the idea". And just when I thought I had a slight idea of ​​who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman who complained about having a puppy? What's up with that? Besides, did Tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. Actually I think I feel for them.
