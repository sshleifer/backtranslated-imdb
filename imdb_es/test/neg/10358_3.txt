Moody, innocent ... does not smoke, drink or motorcyclists, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this morally feasible for a bad motorcyclist movie, the moment after the motorcyclist (explode). They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roarke and Slate were wasted ... but they lived. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY one that really captures the final biker movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors, like Don Stroud, etc.). Was over. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis movies, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the hot modern girl with J. Slate fighting for the honor. It's worth seeing, but it stinks. But take a look. It's worth the types of "bikers" who are not motorcyclists, non-smokers, who are not drinking, with hot girls.
