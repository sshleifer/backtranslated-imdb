This movie was filmed in Randolph County, central North Carolina, in 1968, when a film crew in the state was a bit strange. The places were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. It is not a particularly good movie. I had Merle Haggard and brought life to the interior areas for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is a standard shootemup. Cinematography is that fuzzy material that came out of the late sixties and early seventies. The local people were happy to be part of the company. <br /> <br /> If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this movie, a copy of the record is available in Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> Non-accredited actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.
