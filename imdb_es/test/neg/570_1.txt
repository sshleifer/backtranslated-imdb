Do not waste your time. The plot drags, the characters are wooden and uninteresting, the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable. I kept waiting for the "romantic" or the "comedy" to happen, and nothing happened. Worse yet, the love letter is not even romantic, but it seems that it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline. Did I mention that the "plot twist" we saw at 15 minutes into the movie was "Hollywood ready", which means it's bound to impact, but given the Hollywood mentality, it does not do any of that, and in change is vaguely offensive. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth the $ 2 to rent. Do not bother to see it.
