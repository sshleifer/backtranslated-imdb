I do not think I've ever given anything a rating of 1/10, but it easily gets the denomination. I find it hard to sit down with one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combined with the fact that Carson Daily has no charisma, can not set or finish a plot, and has a comedy recipe for the night that will really turn around . <br /> <br /> I have seen the program, never in its entirety, but many times still. It just scares me after Conan. I usually see a minute or two just to see if Carson is the worst talk show that has ever been heard. <br /> <br /> Actually, if you ever see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. I'm so sorry every time he has a guest and his confused smiles try to mask his body language that screams, "Get away from this monster!" I recommend watching the program, not to laugh, but to reflect on how it got on the air and what it continues to do there. Look all you can, I think you will find your complete discomfort ... interesting.
