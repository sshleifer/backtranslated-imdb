It is said that this is the first Polish West and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known in the USA UU As DEAD MAN'S BOUNTY, this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that does not have much dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some uncomfortable visual situations are really comical in a sickly way. My favorite is a young man who builds a gallows, cuts one of his own fingers and hangs to test the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as 'the stranger' (Karel Roden) finds a dead man (Kilmer) who believes he is a wanted man. It takes you to the nearest city to collect the reward. He ends up losing the corpse and the potential reward in a gambling game with the city's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and makes the few citizens turn against him when he has an alliance with the waitress (Katarzyna Figure). He manages to escape certain death and leads the small gang in a dangerous "wild goose chase". In one scene, the stranger tends to suffer a wound on the scalp cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. The corpse rots chained to a hitch post when the sheriff discovers there is no reward. This film, also known as SUMMER LOVE, has an unforgettable thematic song sung by John Davidson. However, this western is like watching a train crash. There is something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
