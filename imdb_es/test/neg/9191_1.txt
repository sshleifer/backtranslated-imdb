This really is an exercise that makes you tremble. Dressed as a tribute to firefighters, it contains stupid scenes of "we're just a bunch of crazy kids" in the middle of the "Oh my God, this can be really dangerous" parts. Above all it is simply silly. You could not believe for a minute that the real firefighters act like that. It is so horrible that I could not bear to look sometimes. If my daughter had not rented it and then insisted on seeing it until the end, I would have had no choice but to turn it off. <br /> <br /> What happens is that I'm a fan of John Travolta. Every interview of his that I have seen only raises my opinion of him. I think this was one strictly for the money. I'm sure he'll be happy when he forgets.
