I can not really remember any details of this movie, except that the configuration seemed very familiar to me. Then I realized that it was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. That was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandering all over the country. The boy who owns / manages the shelter managed to get into the movie. All I remember about the plot of the movie is that it's about jeeps and naked women. It's great to look only at the landscape (I mean the rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft porn, they'll probably serve you better elsewhere. I do not even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
