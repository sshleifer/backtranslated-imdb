This little heavy sci-fi bull of the late 50's is not quite a loser. It is a manned space rocket that lands in a remote area. A group of scientists will investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma; He is being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. Anyway, the alien monster title soon raises its head causing general chaos, including the partial elimination of the head. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is its rhythm. It takes a long time for the Blood Beast to appear, and it really only becomes yours in the last 20 minutes or so. Undoubtedly, it is a completely ridiculous creation, but that really is not a problem as it provides a good amount of comic relief. At the end of the film, where we have the last confrontation and this ridiculous creature begins to speak with the voice of the doctor who killed before, it will be good not to have a giggle. So also in the bright X-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating in the astronaut's body, it's too much fun for words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the funny moments in The Night of the Blood Beast come very few and far between. If you're a 50s science fiction fan, then it's worth checking out. Just do not expect too much.
