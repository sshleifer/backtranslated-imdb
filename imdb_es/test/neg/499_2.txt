We must recognize Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us the most overrated movie in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before starting with the message 'It's bad but not the worst', let me explain. <br /> <br /> For more than 20 years I listened to critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate"; It was not really difficult because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to see this movie. Then, a few days after watching the documentary "Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate," I stumbled upon a $ 9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to look for the most negative criticism that has been written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that criticism is the devoted mother of Cimino and that she is doing everything possible to put a positive position. The movie of his beloved son. Then you will have an idea of ​​how big a disaster was for Cimino. <br /> <br /> While almost everything is wrong with this movie, which ultimately makes the scale even worse (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of the story. Although the breeders' association sent a group of regulators / gunmen to Johnson County and had a list of specific names, the actual events of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of approximately 50 ranchers and Texas hired guns that had come to Johnson County to clean up the "thieves." The citizens of the county besieged the regulators who were finally arrested (or rescued) by the Army. The women were not actively involved in the fight and, apart from Ray and Champion, there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges, not assaults, and there were no immigrant cars circulating in circles around the regulation camp (the early westerns, on the contrary, were filming devices and not a real tactic of the Indians). And weeks before the regulators arrived, several residents of Johnson County were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the manager of a modest ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (whom Cimino resurrects as his two protagonists and even shows Averell living to a mature old age). <br /> <br /> There is no sin in making movies bigger than fiction, if you're going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect unsuspecting members of the audience that could get away from A movie that believes what they saw actually happened. Fortunately, so few people saw this movie that the damage was minimal. It may be hard to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. You could probably escape guilt anyway with a defense of insanity: the movie offers a lot of support. If Cimino were crazy during the production of Heaven's Gate, that would explain many things. But my vote goes to "lack of talent to lead" instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about the Gate of Heaven. In fact, you can see on the screen where part of the huge budget went; Expensive sets, beautiful epic camera shots, artistic dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that really worked) offers a pleasant and pleasant performance, although most of her scenes are extremely boring (which usually happens when the director forgets to give the viewer some reason to worry about the characters) . The dialogue is generally solid but quite ordinary. <br /> <br /> But do not fall for the crap that this movie experiences with storytelling by mixing carefully designed moments of character interaction with community action bursts with textured scroll texture. This implies that there was a method for Cimino's madness. "Experiments" is another word for when a filmmaker is so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Cimino has included a single scene in a script or made any attempt at control or organization. What it seems is that he simply made his DP loosened to stage the action and get an infinite selection of colorful shots: 1.5 million feet of staged scenes. Then he tried (unsuccessfully) to reduce this and fit everything into postproduction. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the battle is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing village women (perhaps borrowed from a tour company 'Fiddler On The Roof') throwing innumerable dynamite bullets at regulators. Unfortunately, each explosive falls just before the target and explodes without causing damage. After you see that this happens between 50 and 60 times, you can relate to the woman (the one that looks like something that appears in 'The Grapes of Wrath') that puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. Probably this is what Cimino's mother did after writing that review. <br /> <br /> So, create what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a sloppy, disconnected, slow-paced and historically distorted mess. Of value only as an example of 'how not to make a film' for film historians and as a source of entertainment for those who know the true history of the American West.
