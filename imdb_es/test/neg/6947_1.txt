I could not believe it. This movie was a total waste of my life time. The title is appropriate. Love did not beat me, this movie did it. I kept looking and watching and waiting and waiting and waiting for something, anything to happen. And nothing ever happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard could not even save this unconvincing play called film. It was dark, confused and I did not understand who killed the bride in the end. It was assumed that the tone and rhythm of the film were being built to a dramatic climactic finale. This only served to confuse the audience because the film simply kept going going nowhere. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
