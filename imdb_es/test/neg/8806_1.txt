I can not believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex, at least I think that's what it was about. The script did not make any sense at all, I could not care less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing images of shadows of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African-American man, I often read the pleas of my brothers to "support African-American films." I try to help, but that's enough. No one should see garbage like this for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, do not directly produce video rats like this one. Please!
