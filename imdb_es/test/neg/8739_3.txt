To be honest, I never read one of the comics and I do not remember parts 2 and 3 at all. I can compare it with the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part 1 and compared to most of the other movies I saw in the last few weeks. The first few minutes seem to be simply an unnecessary clone of the first introduction of the movie and then it is getting even worse. There are some good scenes (funny), but in total it is another boring second-rate test of the German film industry that can not succeed (almost as always). One good thing: the movie is quite short (75 min.) The bad: it only contains stories and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Do not see it
