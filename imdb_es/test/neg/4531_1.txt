<br /> <br /> After the ingenuity and vivacity of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this movie to shine, but I was as bloated and self-deceived as the hard rock stars it parodied. The rhythm dragged, not helped by a too long sequence of hallucination, the characters were flat and not memorable, and Art Bergmann is not Jello Biafra. I had to push myself to stay awake.
