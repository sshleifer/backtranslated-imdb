The very strange script of Cameron Crowe (following in the footsteps of his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and fades with silly gags. At least "Fast Times" had a fair share of the satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing perfect lyrics for teenagers); Here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the fool who makes life hell for the straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think it's hilarious. Jenny Wright has some good times as a mall worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith gets lost in a secondary argument about how to scratch her head about a teenager who seems to be in love with a former shock soldier. Nonsense, confusing nonsense, with a brilliant brightness and a soundtrack full of pop-rock melodies, but characters that one would hope to avoid. Supporters Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted on stupid roles. * since ****
