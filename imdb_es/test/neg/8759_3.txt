Well, well, I had seen many reviews on this subject and many promotions that always showed the decapitation scene. But this movie is hard. And I say it anyway. It is difficult to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent version and because the MPAA was looking for each copy on VHS, it came out without qualifying but it had to be classified for the MPAA. Thus copies disappeared in the underground scene. All the people involved in this movie never did anything else in the business. So he made this movie unique. VHS copies almost never appear on eBay or other sites, and if they do, they will pay more than $ 100 to get one. But due to connections with the United States, I was able to watch a DVD release sold around the world. Limited but it was a kind of officer. From time to time there are still some projections of this splatterfest. But is it worth all the hype surrounding it? As stated before, it is difficult to catch but also to sit down. There are bloody murders, there is necrophilia, there are nudes, but there is also a lot of talk among the police. And to be honest, if you'd like to see the movie in 5 minutes, see the end, it's a flashback in the murderer's mind. The blood flows and, in fact, it's a splash party, but not the full 80 minutes, splashes in abundance for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is good, it sounds good, without whistling, the colors are good, black is black and not blue like in many low budgets. It's good to see it, but you'll never be scared, but I think it's something to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
