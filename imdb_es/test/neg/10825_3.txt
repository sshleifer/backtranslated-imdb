The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the ending alludes to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of researchers from caves and submarines go to Romania (one of these cheap places to make a movie, at least for now) and after a destroyed church they enter a cave that turns out to be a kingdom of underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, it's a mix of all without salt or fun, and it acted in a wooden way. The best thing about the film is the cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave soon becomes boring, because the film lacks rhythm and the characters are simply not interesting. Waste of time.
