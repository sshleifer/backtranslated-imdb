How could this get a grade of 6.0? Are we such terror fans so accustomed to horror movies being so bad these days, that when one arrives who has some and I repeat 'just a few', redeeming the quality, we get too excited and give a rating that is just one a little too loud? The director has a certain visual style. No doubt about that. But between some decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or fear. It had a very slow first act, scenes of lazy killings, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and incredible turn. And what about the representation of American teenagers in so many of these types of movies? Do they always have to be so stupid, irritating and, therefore, superficial? I do not remember that teenagers were like that when I grew up here in Holland. After all, I can not give this movie anything more than a rating of 4 out of 10.
