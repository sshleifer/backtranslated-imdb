A feminist section in which if the viewer believes that: i) wild animals are rarely domesticated by song, but they attack, kill and eat (the line that grizzlies never attack unless it was produced was a call, unless "provoked" means that you see meat); ii) homosexuality is at the same time immoral, and its acceptance is almost always associated throughout history with signs of dissolution and decline of society iii) few women are bisexual (in this, it is virtually presented that all women do not they have preference for men or women)) iv) divorce is much worse than infidelity v) the land is there for humans to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is as much for the mother of an adult son to maintain contact as to the mother vii) the mother raising her child alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) the idolatry of a father for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) the adults are still responsible for their behavior sexual, regardless of age and the duty to participate in this act as intimate and exclusive as part of the most intimate and openly sacrificial relationships: marriage, believe me, you will not like this movie! Essentially it is a type of companion of Howard Stern that is demolished by a woman of type Jane Fonda (think about The Electric Jorseman). It is ugly because the values, the ideals of the script are very harmful. <br /> <br /> I share the other objections about the strange things of writing: a) why would this man lose all the brides he has? Because he refuses to reveal that the death and funeral of his mother did that I could not keep appointments with them? It's a mystery why she keeps saying "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. HUH? <br /> <br /> b) there is a huge inconsistency (that is, the scriptwriter wants to have it in both directions) to tell us that the mother of the protagonist loved the father with everything he had, and then they tell us that it was only A great love in his life: his lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) the underlying legal assumptions do not make sense. We are never told that the executor has any right to live on the property, simply that she will determine the time of the title of the sole heir and the right to occupy the property. However, somehow, the movie makes it look like the executor is the legitimate occupant, which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will who uses the property of the deceased before the bequests of the will are fulfilled, that is not the case). <br /> <br /> d) The assumption throughout this film is that women are equally attracted. for men and women, it is simply absurd. Therefore, we are told: i) that the character of Penelope Ann Miller is dating other men near the end of the film, after having been with the deceased for five years, and before that in a satisfactory relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after having dedicated all her adult life to her kind husband, now is dating another woman iii) that a girlfriend angry with the protagonist now "therefore, would like to prove to a woman". <br /> <br /> iv) that a male transsexual is eager to go out with the protagonist v) that the character of Mary Kay Place naturally looked at other women in college ("and looked back", she says with a idiot triumphant head blow). <br /> <br /> All this is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with the others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at full volume and rewind repeatedly to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a movie of someone who really despises the traditional heroics of any man, hates the idea that a man is needed to raise a child, hates the idea that there is a necessary connection between the marriage and sex. The film is meant to preach, and that kind of false message propaganda does not suit you.
