I'm glad I never saw this program when it came out. <br /> <br /> I wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I survive growing up in this era? <br /> <br /> The acting in most of the episodes that I have seen is forced. This makes for very boring shows. The lines of the plot are not very interesting as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stay with the old Twilight Zone shows and save yourself the pain of seeing garbage.
