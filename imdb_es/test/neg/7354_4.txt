What could have been so spooky ended up being an incomprehensible, crazy movie that even the filmmakers themselves probably did not understand. If they had shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever, it could have been more creepy, but as it is now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. Is anyone else getting tired of the "little boy who draws creepy images with crayons"? Could there be a bigger cliche of terror? Probably not. I know, I know, it's from a different country, and it's too refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so I should not expect the "plan" to be fed with a spoon, blah, blah, blah. Whatever is. I still say that the movie blows.
