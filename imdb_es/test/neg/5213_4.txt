This is an admirable attempt by the first filmmaker Ham Tran, which offers an unattractive perspective on the victims of the Vietnam War who fight for liberation, but who present themselves as a glorified history special. With a clumsy, consciously informative dialogue and less than normal performance, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not come to life in this fervent yet historically valuable melodrama. Not paying attention to the often distracted disconnection with actors from the reality of on-screen situations, and should be left with an informative, albeit somewhat impersonal, educational lesson in the post-war history in Vietnam.
