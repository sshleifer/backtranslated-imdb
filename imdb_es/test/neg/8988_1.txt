I saw this movie for the sexy guy, and even he stunk! He was the worst. Well, it's okay, I also have to give support to that strange police officer, it was also worse. The boy was not so cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and it was the most definite definition of Hicksville idiot that he can not face his mother for the "love" that there has been. In general, and if this makes any sense to you, when I go to pick up movies in the video store, I think to myself as I read the back of a movie that looks great, "Well, at least I can not Be worse that Carolina Moon. " The most terrible film, and the most terrible plot, writing and acting: everything that contained made my gag reflexes go around. It was the most horrible movie I've ever seen, with Gabriela up there too. I hated it, and believe me, if there were a number less than 1 that IMDb had to qualify, I would choose it in the blink of an eye.
