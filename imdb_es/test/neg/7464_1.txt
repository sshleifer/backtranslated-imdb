Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman who hated Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how having sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) can be entertaining or fun. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that this type of film feeds the fire of hatred and other misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects instead of human beings. We call ourselves "civilized", however, I think we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of being civilized.
