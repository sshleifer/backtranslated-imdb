Hmph. Soul Plane is supposed to be a parody of "black comedy" from a well-known movie, Airplane. This movie is a black comedy made at its worst. Stereotypes can be fun, and often they are. But in this photo, it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything that people associate with the "urban" culture of today. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Tom Arnold in this movie is the salvation of this film, if he ever had one. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart is a poor main character here ... his appearance in this movie will probably become annoying to many. The appearance of Method Man and Snoop was, by far, the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm happy I did not pay to see this movie ...
