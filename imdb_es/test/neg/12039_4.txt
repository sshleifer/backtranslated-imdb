They show that the police, when they can not find the real perpetrators, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their children. These films always represent the press as a group of animals and make parents leave the court to feed the hunger of the press to humiliate the afflicted. Has anyone ever heard of a back door of a courtroom in these movies? Here, there is a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and WHERE the body can be found, but the police are not informed and no one attends to their findings. They know what they are doing and there is always an external detective, like Ed Asner, who is late for the case, believes in the parents and solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> Also, once the parents are free, do not spit on the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail, they took their son and accused them of killing their own son. <br /> <br /> It seems like I've seen this movie MANY times before.
