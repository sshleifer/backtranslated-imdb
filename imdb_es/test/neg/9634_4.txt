HANDS OF THE RIPPER <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian doctor (Eric Porter) uses an analysis Freudian novelty in a girl (Angharad Rees) who happens to be the daughter of Jack the Ripper, and so deadly ... <br /> <br /> It is an unlikely Hammer horror, in which a respectable figure of society he takes care of a beautiful young woman without having to attract as much as a whiff of scandal, even when she tries to murder each and every one with a variety of lethal implements (broken mirrors, hats, etc.)! L.W. Davidson's script wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the inherent subtext of the material (Porter's obvious attraction to Rees) in favor of the commercial melodrama, and the tone remains low all the time. Some of the bloody scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for Hammer, and were cut out of the original US release. UU (Despite an R rating from the MPAA), although the full version is now available in the home video. Porter and Rees give excellent performances, and the climax in St. Paul's Cathedral is a definitive highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely empty and unaffected. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
