It looked like it was going to be like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something like that, but it was not. It really was more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jumping scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 From Outer Space, in the sense that the main bad guy kept making foolish speeches that made me want to go eat something without pausing. The idea of ​​a person who is so crazy that they would kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is really an interesting idea, but the execution was too much of a feeling for television. I must say it was better than I expected for a movie written and starring Dee Snider. A good first effort. Maybe you will learn some lessons and your next effort will be less clumsy.
