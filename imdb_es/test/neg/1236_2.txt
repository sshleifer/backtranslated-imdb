Agustus and Call really did not do anything? Why are they heroes? They did nothing but go to places after the bad guys were dead. What was the point of this show? I was very, very disappointed. I expected more action, more history, and to see the birth of Heros and Great Deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it seemed Agustus and Call, where only the story is for the great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure the story is very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and the Comanches fought each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this movie was that Zhan played Gus very well and is a great actor. A lot of good history that could have been lost. It was sad and I wish I had not seen it.
