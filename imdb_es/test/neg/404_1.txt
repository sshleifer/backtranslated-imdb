I saw this movie based on the comments of some who said it was bad but fun. But you must warn that this movie has the worst special effects that have occurred. They make the science fiction films of the fifties look like works of art. This is fun at times, but annoying for the most part. And to complicate the problem with seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized most of the events described. One of my favorites is where three of the characters fall hundreds of feet in a tunnel created by the arachnid and come to find it fully illuminated. Apparently, the arachnia has also managed to connect to the electricity grid. Very impressive. But this is just an example. And for what it's worth, the music sucks, the performance sucks, the two pretty girls are annoying, the hateful boy is annoying, the so-called handsome man is a geek, and the black girl who falls in love with him is a fool. His father is the worst actor I've seen. I'm not sure that brief moments of humor can make up for the experience.
