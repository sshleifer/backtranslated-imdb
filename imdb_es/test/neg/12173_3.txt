In the confused zombie film of the house of art of Michele Soavi, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead do not remain buried for long. With the help of his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco faces the problem of the zombies in the cemetery, either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a shovel. <br /> <br /> However, shortly after falling in love with the mysterious and beautiful widow of one of his recently buried, Francesco is busier than ever? <br /> <br /> Having obtained some particularly favorable comments from some of the most respected IMDb horror officiates, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I just finished watching the movie, and I can honestly say that I have not been so disappointed by a horror movie for quite some time. <br /> <br /> With its confusing and confused pseudo-philosophical plot, and Dellamorte Dellamore, an extremely insipid performance by the leader Everett, it is an irritating and painful mess that does not even a bit of splatter gore (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and welcome the gratuitous nudity (of the busty Anna Fialchi) can save. I can not understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this presumptuous bilge has received from its mistaken fans.
