Half of a mystical thriller and half of the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind, "Guardian of the Frontier" is a captivating journey that soon derails. Strong images and a convincing premise are soon overwhelmed by incoherent conspiracy, trite dialogue, amateur acting and the most extravagant and exaggerated phallic image of recent memory (here, a fish is definitely not a fish!). Obviously, this is the first Slovenian film directed by a woman. Ms. Weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as scathing and explicitly explicit as any man.
