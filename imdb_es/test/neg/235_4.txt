In the first place, I was not sure who this film was aimed at; It seemed like a story for kids, but it had things kids could not understand and they seemed boring. There really was not much to do, Bruce Willis was not as stiff as an actor. He did a lot of looking to one side with that half smile of his, unless you're a big fan of him, it would not bother me. And if it's the story you're interested in (the guy who seems to have everything but who emotionally lacks lessons from a child), I'd go see About a child. It has everything that this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.
