It's really easy to toast, roast, flay and, otherwise, burn this film for all its abundant faults. It was made by high school students and teachers and a whole community; sample! Sure, I could examine the script that is ridiculous. A monster created from the garbage of a growing California city begins to eat garbage and take garbage cans throughout the city. Soon, this huge beast with wings begins to destroy buildings and even interprets the act of "the beauty and the beast" with a young girl from high school. Fortunately for her, there is a gang of men, her ex-boyfriend, nicknamed "The Penguin", and the city got drunk to help her. The direction is horrible, the production values ​​just terrible, the performance non-existent and the pace slow. The movie is difficult to sit during the period. However, having said that, it is also a miracle of a movie when you consider that this thing was created by an entire community. You can see all the collective effort of the actors, the real mayor and the real firefighters and police, up to the area location shots used. I was also very surprised by the fact that all the local companies accredited at the end of the film helped finance or contribute in some way to the film. When you look at the film from that perspective, it is a real achievement. I did not know anything about it before sitting down and looking at it. Now that I've discovered something about it, I'm impressed. But make no mistake, I do not have ... NO ... I want to sit down again.
