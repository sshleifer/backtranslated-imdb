I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul that I considered as the best movie about rock and roll, besides being the best movie for teenagers I've seen. The first film spawned the careers of George Lucas, who would then make the hit epic "Star Wars" before making the prequels two decades later, while making Richard Dreyfuss a star on Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other films as well. <Br /> <br /> Somehow, without those two, the magic died out. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows the public what happened to the rest of the characters later in the sixties where Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) are protesting against the war of Vietnam while his friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is in the same war and is trying to leave. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) remains the racing driver in California, where he never left home. The rest of the supporting actors in the Candy Clark's movie Debbie (Terry's Girlfriend), the members of Pharaoh's gang, along with Harrison Ford and others, do not really do much. The original movie showed teenagers going through the streets without bloodshed with the old rock and roll music of Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the Comets, Buddy Knox and more, which brought him back the problem of nostalgia. classical music. The soundtrack of "More American Graffiti" is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and whatever fits the mood during the late 1960s of protests, drugs, sacrifices and more. <br /> <br /> After seeing "More American Graffiti" it seemed that he wanted to show the members of the audience what happened after the epilogue of the title of the four main characters of the first film (with the exception of the character of Dreyfuss) where it was not necessary. This film was not necessary either, since I was glad to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss went on to bigger and better projects.
