Before speaking my article, I would like to clarify some things: 1) I am a girl who does not like girls movies ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone Like You" are EXTREME exceptions: the ass of Hugh Jackman). 2) I just picked this one up because I'm a Fichtner Fangirl who was waiting to see him in a bathtub. 3) I'm not a fan of Demi, although I think his performances in "Immortal" and "A Few Good Men" were sublime and have won places in my video library. I also think she's a bit crazy (no way is it's NOT yet to sleep with Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is a study of the character of an unsatisfied woman who lives a double life of independence and happiness, then I would say that we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: literary agent. Makes a salary of 6 figures. Live in a luxury penthouse in Manhattan. Easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for a bit of suggestion of night escapism. Or maybe go through an interdisciplinary portal? She has the race, the appearance, a great car, a big pillow, now where are the men and the children? In steps our boy Aaron - a true escapism. What are architects? They are artists who can do mathematics, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Marty the safety dream and fills a void where she obviously has no confidence in herself. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin, there's Marie, who still lives her schoolgirl fantasies while getting into motherhood. Your children are your career and your life. But what about Marie, she only exists through her children? In waltzes, William, a strange Parisian who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost contact with: herself. <br /> <br /> A supposed journey of self-discovery and a coming of age in some of them with anguish and some resentment towards Marty / Marie's own mother. This gets a 3/10. All I can say is that, thank God for the BPL multimedia division, I would not spend my $ 2.99 on Blockbuster on this, but on a Harlequin Blaze title.
