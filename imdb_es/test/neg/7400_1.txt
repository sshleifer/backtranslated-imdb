What a damn annoyance! You can not address issues like these with TV budgets and some smartass directors who can not distinguish the difference between a Lanc I, II and III. All the stupid clich√©s are well in place; At the level of the character and human, the story is so clumsy and incredible that it hurts. And all the responsible ones are let go with joy by the brilliant qualifications. Technical details of the garbage. The spears that flew so close would have been thrown from the sky one by the other by a dozen. Night fighters with a single engine attacking the stern line: ridiculous. As I said: invented by a director who I bet I never heard the name of Lancaster before that project and some 3D guys that turned Lancs into ducks. But these are minor things compared to the general mediocrity of this movie. Although it could be too hard, I dare say that this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. Television shit, entertaining the dumb masses that do not care anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you get from it.
