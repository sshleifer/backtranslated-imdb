I saw this movie for a reason: the motto is "Does it hurt your head? And you're dead!" Cracking. Not surprisingly, this stupid horror comedy fades away before the tape comes out of the box, but spits some laughter from its strange premise and its cast of characters: a human radar with eagle eyes, a big strong man and a large A sex magnet with a broken chest is controlled by the mind by a huge head on a chair, who is not happy that his family has been blackmailed by a killer bastard. This seems to be a promising mix of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a joke and the plot is quite common if, on the other hand, it ignores the giant head.
