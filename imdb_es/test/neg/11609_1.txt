After sitting through this horrible excuse of an 82-minute movie, and having previously wanted to take my eyes off after seeing another disaster directed by James Toback called "When will I be loved?", I have come to the conclusion that He He has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written and painfully directed garbage pieces be made? <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe being in this movie led to substance abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham has to feel ashamed for her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on it, it's just looking dazed. <br /> <br /> Such a horrible script. Prepare for the abundance of Hollywood names (example: five meandering arguments about the performance of Denzel Washington ... etc.). <br /> <br /> There is a great character in the Joseph Heller Catch-22 novel called Dunbar. He spends most of his time in the skeet novel, which he abhors. When asked why he shoots without stopping, if he hates him so much, he replies that he makes time pass CREEP and will have a longer life. Well ... if you really want to feel the time, watch this movie. I swear ... the 82 minutes will feel more than an epic of David Lean for 4 hours. Go on and on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope you never see another James Toback movie again. If I could give this NO STARS, I would.
