It may be that the film I saw was completely different from what others saw, however, as the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut that I saw in Europe differed from the one that circulated in the United States. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was the worst movie I saw in the last five years. (Followed closely by The Waterboy ...) <br /> <br /> Why: because, in my opinion, this director has taken elements of all the thrillers before this, mixed them, put them in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. <br /> <br /> (Examples: nothing happens, the music is scary, and nothing still happens.) The "grumpy" officer shows us grumpy in a way that would allow the actor to suspend any kind of performance. Moment of friends that comes out of nowhere at the end There is an inescapable scene and in the next scene all problems disappear.) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a smart movie: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: watch any thriller that comes to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: watch Dirty Dancing.
