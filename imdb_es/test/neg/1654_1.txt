Oh my God! Beeb reached its lowest point with this senseless act of political correctness, a mixed-race family living in Birmingham with a disabled child that has been launched to a large extent. Whoever ordered this gut should be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The usually funny Jasper Carrott is as funny as the batteries in this program and I do not mean the others. They have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb. I just hope that the comedy improves, but with the likes of Little Britain and Catherine Tate, I doubt it. I think it would be better to get the set for a decent comedy of yesteryear, like Fawlty Towers or Bottom, if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> PRACTICE THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
