Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous killers of films like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the sickest and most disturbing murderers of all time. I saw a documentary about him, so I know his story quite well. When I saw this, I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be like a documentary recreation, but I have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First of all, the facts are completely wrong, with some minor exceptions, and secondly, this was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrible murders really happened and they became a cheap dollar. Not to mention that if they were to become a horror movie, this was badly done! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein, he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole city is being affected, he unearths corpses and brutally murders people. Bobby, a deputy, is in the case of getting Ed Gein, alone, nobody knows who the killer is at the beginning, he's just finding the crime scene after the crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed starts messing with the family and friends of the cops. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was simply ridiculous and completely insulting to the real story. I always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool for a horror movie, but for this story, it should have been a movie with better acting, not to mention that it should have been more a documentary than a stupid clich√© horror movie. Please stay away from this movie, it is completely pathetic and false to the story of Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> 1/10
