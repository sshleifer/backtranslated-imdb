"R Xmas" resembles the life of a family of narco-distributors of middle class married with children during the Christmas season. There is no history here, just an unconnected collection of events. Ferrara seems to begin the juxtaposition of vacation and family life with narcotics trafficking in New York, jumping back and forth between each one. The players seem to be improving and guessing from time to time to make an unconvincing watch. In general, a poor effort is not worth the time. (RE)
