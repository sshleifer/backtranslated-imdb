All the hype! All the additions! I was disappointed that I missed this on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the small details. In EVERYTHING else it failed. Arnold has done many better performances in recent years. I thought that the days of Commando and Last Action Hero had gone out of our lives. Unfortunately, this film satisfies the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a muscle that bellows, grunts and contorts the face that only knows how to shoot weapons and explode things. In a clich√© at the last moment (and at another time), which was predictable from the beginning, we see a reflection of the actor who has shown that it is more than what he was paid at the beginning of his career. I was not very impressed with the film, since it never opened new paths or went anywhere, except in the place you expected.
