First of all, I have read the comments of the director below and would like to thank you for offering your opinion. I've always wondered what the creators of the films criticized in MST3K felt about the destruction of their works (not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights). Rissi's comments make me curious, however, as to the amount of science fiction that could have cut the movie to look different (now I'm thinking I could rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the uncut version or the MST3K version of this movie, but even having seen it on MST3K, I never saw it as a bad movie or something that can not be seen (although I think it was a very funny episode of MST3K ). ); certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "peeling hideous skin"; Not after seeing the likes of "Future War" and "Hobgoblins." <br /> <br /> As for cutting the film, it has been done before in MST3K, at least once. Case in point: Joe Don Baker's film, Mitchell, in which the secondary plot of the character of John Saxon is cut in the MST3K version, however, Joel and the Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after its appearance at the beginning of the movie. If I can send a critique to MST3K, if you need to cut the movie for the sake of time, it's fine, but it's fair for the movie to be cut (even if it's a movie as bad as Mitchell). Of course, this criticism is quite useless in the event that the program is over, but I think that aspect of the program was a bit unfair. But anyway, if it's the case with Soultaker, he sympathizes. <br /> <br /> Even so, I maintain that it is a nice episode of MST3K, although the movie itself, even the "hacked" version in MST3K, is not that terrible. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in a strange coincidence or maybe in a Synchronicity case, I saw the Hudsucker Proxy on the day that Soultaker aired and you would not know it, the guy who played Vivian's father Schelling. He had a small part in that movie; one of his other three accredited papers, actually. I thought that was kind of weird.
