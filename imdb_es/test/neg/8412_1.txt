Usually, I look for the good in movies, even bad ones. Unfortunately, this movie is one in which I fail miserably, and the fact that there is hardly a positive review in this forum shows that many IMDb critics share my pain. <br /> <br /> I do not usually see sequels, but I had to see this because I love "Rosemary's Baby" so much. What a big mistake that was. It simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most of the sequels are bad, although fortunately, very few are as bad as this one. In fact, in my opinion this is not really a sequel, it's a satire about how bad a sequel can be. Movie highly recommended to not see it, at any time.
