There is nothing particularly unique or interesting in this low budget science fiction race. Regardless of its pedigree origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and general themes of this film are by no means remarkable or original, science is weak at best, and unfortunately , the film does not manage to match. it involves convincing action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and although the main plot does not begin to roll until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes occur along the way. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers land, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life, and everything interesting about the film, they give way to a remotely coherent plot with respect to the Martian revolutionaries, the environmental problems and not very convincing Web deception. <br /> <br /> There is also nothing remarkable in the production quality of the film. It's passable And most of the acting is, albeit slow, good. Cameron Mitchell is quite good and plays a nice character. I suppose the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its fashion sense. The Martians have very nice costumes! If this movie had a point, it could have been much more interesting. Oh good.
