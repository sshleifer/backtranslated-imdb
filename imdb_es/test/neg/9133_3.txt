The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi, we are assaulted by the images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent and the digital: the destructive constructions of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are taken with the images, with posterization, anguish. , and a lot in slow motion. The connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if any. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, a lost opportunity to place the images in context. <br /> <br /> The film is hard to see, the quality of the footage is uneven, and its most redeeming qualities are its subject and Philip Glass's hypnotic score.
