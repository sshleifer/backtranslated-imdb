I do not know what the creators of this film tried to achieve or say, but they failed in anything. Unless, of course, the object was to completely confuse the viewer. I saw this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it turned out that she had a small cameo. The idea of ​​having this child on a wild car trip to win a big prize money at a gas station game and meet all sorts of crazy people is absolutely ridiculous.
