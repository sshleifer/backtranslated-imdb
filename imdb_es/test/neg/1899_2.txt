What a frustrating movie A small southern city is brimming with possibilities to explore the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark objects hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read something by Carson McCullers already knows. This does not do any of that. Instead, the writers settled for the beautiful flashes, the warm and cheap melodramas and the melodrama. The thing looks like a movie made for television, and was directed without any particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what someone could have done to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are many extremely competent and attractive actors in this cast, all trying to do the best things and do what they can with this, well, there's another word to refute this. A tragic waste of talent, particularly that of the great Stockard Channing.
