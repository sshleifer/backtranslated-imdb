Bloody Birthday opens to a photo of Meadowvale General Hospital. There are three babies born at exactly the same time during a total eclipse. A subtitle informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980'. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) get down to work in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are killed. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a rope to jump from a child that Annie held, like a clue. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody could resolve the case, his youngest daughter, Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of his friends, Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman), murdered him. Just as they are finishing up with Sheriff Brody from another boy in his class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) appears, the three assassins do not know what he saw. Shortly after the incident, Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy in an old closet. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she does not believe him at first. The three children continue their killing spree. His strict teacher, Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a couple who makes love (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister, Beverly (Julie Brown), are among his victims. Joyce begins to have his suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven, which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Can they convince the authorities that these three innocent-looking 10-year-olds are really soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have a great dislike for this movie. I think it's absolutely horrible and it does not have a single nice look to its 83 minute run time. The Hunt and Barry Pearson script does not give us any explanation for the motives of child killers beyond the solar eclipse that blocks Saturn and, therefore, for some strange astrological reason, these three children have no consciousness, so that these are the only children born during a total eclipse? If that is true, why do you wait until shortly before your tenth birthday before beginning your wave of murders? I guess it suddenly goes into action, right? For your credit, it's reasonably well-accelerated, but I still find it incredibly boring and tedious to sit down. The film as a whole is not very exciting and predictable, the children are revealed as murderers in the first 10 minutes and, as I mentioned, almost no reason is given. It is very silly sometimes, too. Take a look at the scene where Debbie stops Steven throwing him a bowl of water! The death of the sheriff is attributed to him by falling some steps, yes, of course, the injuries that suffered that type of accident will not be the same as if you were hit with a baseball bat as if it were in fact, any competent doctor. or the pathologist would have seen it in 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood spilled throughout the film and all boring murders are boring and unimaginative. There is some nudity that seems out of place, since Debbie charges 25 c. To allow children to look through a hole while their sister Beverly strips naked. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the mike boom is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a bit of all that. General incompetence continues throughout the film. All production is insipid and instantly forgettable. The acting is bad at all times, those three children are very annoying and they made me nervous from the beginning and made this movie an even more difficult task, especially Curtis in his geeky glasses of great size. I hate this movie really, as simple as that. I can not think of anything good to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.
