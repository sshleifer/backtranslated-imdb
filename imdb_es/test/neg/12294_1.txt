Calling this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The performance was not convincing to say the least, especially of actor Craig Fong, who could not have acted more rigidly. As for the story goes ... well ... what story? The "movie" is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malay of Chinese descent who returns to his home country after giving up all the courses he took and trying to form a band. <br /> <br /> The film has always been a clich√© you can think of: sex, tension between the members of the band and a bit of racial tension. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even with a theme that has been adequately covered by the most amateur directors, this movie is everywhere and everything feels contrived with parts that would make even the toughest hairs of the critics are on edge. <br /> <br />
