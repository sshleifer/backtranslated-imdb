I saw this movie when it was released in Los Angeles. I think I laughed 2 or 3 times. The rest of the time I was shocked by how ridiculous / badly thrown and badly written I was. Kirby is, in fact, the only salvation in the movie. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, whom I usually find entertaining. If you like to watch your friend's homemade short films filmed on your mother's 8-mm video camera, there's a chance you'll enjoy this movie. On the other hand, part of what makes these movies enjoyable is that it's your friends who play all the parts. You do not know these people, so you probably find him as boring and stupid as me. Dear Mr. Nelson, return to the film school, intern for a time as a personal assistant or a low level job so you can see how things are done correctly in the movie. Then, look for the Director of Photography who knows what f. stop means, make sure you have a ND filter in your hand. Try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
