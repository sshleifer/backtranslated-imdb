Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what I was trying to do with this movie. If it was to turn my good day into a night of disturbing memories of what I think was successful. <br /> <br /> I know that in this movie there were big questions like who we really are, what we are here for, there is really a god. All the big questions, but I really do not think it's funny when you have the questions next to that tragedy. I'm totally portrayed from real life, but come on. It is never funny when a wife is raped, someone who kills himself (and family and friends find the body) and people die for inexplicable and unnecessary reasons. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was the location was shot. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I am not a film student or even know a lot about the subject. I admit it, but I know that when I leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a film I would recommend to anyone.
