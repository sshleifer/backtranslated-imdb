It hurt me to see this movie, it really did ... I wanted to like it, even enter. Shooted obviously for very little money, I looked beyond and I told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I appreciated the film at that level, the acting and editing were terrible, and the last 25 to 30 minutes were a severe territory with thumb movements. A 95 minute movie should not drag. The ratings for this are good so far, but I'm afraid that friends and family might have had something to say about it. What was it with those transitions? Dear Mr. Editor, did you just buy your first copy of Adobe Premiere and your main goal is to use all the ridiculous transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion, and a more engaging edition, and this makes a decent movie.
