First I will say that I will be as subjective as I can. <br /> <br /> There will be some possible spoilers ahead, so be careful. <br /> <br /> I almost never check the movies, but this One in particular I felt I had to check. This Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children movie, based on the popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for the ps1, has been in development for quite some time. After years of exaggerations and dozens of trailers (none of which I had seen, I had only seen still photos), this film made the legions of fans were really excited to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a fan of movies, I was also very excited. So I thought to myself: "WHAT COULD GO EVIL?" <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started well in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progresses. Undoubtedly, this is the best CGI animation you can see, but that will not help a weak plot, undeveloped characters and indulgent action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here is the story basically. These three silver-skinned nancy boys who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who supposedly murdered all his supposed clones) are trying to kidnap all the kids for some reason. I did not really explain it so well, probably to make an army (as children?) They also focus part of the story on a boy named Denzel, I do not know who this child is or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones are also involved in some kind of scheme that involves some disease called geostigma, which only affects children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> So now Cloud must save The day of these guys. Apparently, Cloud and his teammates have learned the ability to fly, I felt a little insulted that these characters flew around a city fighting a dragon and landing on his feet all the time. Maybe if the movie was not so exaggerated, then the view relax and be surprised with something incredible. The real problem with this movie is logic. Now I know what you're going to say: "But it's called Final FANTASY! I should have those ideas!" Well, that's a silly way of thinking, the game is based on some kind of reality and the movie should go on in that CONTEXT. The context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I would end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also some scenes from this movie were extremely ingenious and trivial. like when all the characters in the game appear just in time for their mandatory screen time so as not to disturb the fans. They appear, appear little and have almost no meaning in history. <br /> <br /> If this is too long, here's the simplest review: <br /> <br /> the pros: the first 20 minutes of top-notch animation cgi visually stunning decent action scenes <br / > <br /> the illogical about indulgent action / unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot superhuman characters = without suspense the j-rock Soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible end <br /> <br /> SPOILER FOR BIG TIME - <br /> <br /> Now the end of this movie really disappointed me. they could have gone to the end really cool and sweet where the cloud dies and meets Aeris in the afterlife, but after the big battle in the final cloud shoots in the back, a little the wound where the bullet bursts in the chest . Then, Cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a puddle of Lifestream. (Now I remember the current of life in the game, but it did not have resuscitation properties, if I did, they could have returned Aeris life, thus creating a completely different story), so the cloud comes back to life and everyone has a party. and dive into the pool and we have an ultra cheezy lifestyle / distinctive moment. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie does not have its moments. It's worth seeing for his visuals. but that's it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that it is not really a good movie. It is strictly for the blind fanatics of the game. Not for people who care about plot and character and storytelling.
