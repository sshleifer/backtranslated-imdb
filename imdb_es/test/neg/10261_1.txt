Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And there is all the blood and blood that was in "Demons", which is a good movie and did not give any fear. My brother said that this movie was bad, but I had to give it a try since the first movie was very good. When the movie ended, I understand why my brother thought that this movie was bad. The only advantage of this movie was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie and the soundtrack of music is not the most important thing. And I saw that four sequels have been released after this movie, I have not seen any of them, but they can be as horrible as this, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I'll see them sometime.
