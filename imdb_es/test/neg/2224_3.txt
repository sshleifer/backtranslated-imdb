Based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides little more than a means to escape and give your brain a break. A Victorian scientist, Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invents a gigantic bulldozer, which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to remove the cork from the depths of the earth to explore the mysteries it may contain. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures that have conflict with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing presents himself as a distracted teacher to the point of being annoying. Instead of being a daring adventurer, he is effeminate. On the other hand, McClure exaggerated enough to make him laugh too. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful Princess Dia who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
