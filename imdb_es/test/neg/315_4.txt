Okay, I could only find three reasons to think that this movie is worth taking into account the extremely low budget. <br /> <br /> First it was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. Actually, the two gave me four good reasons to look, and I saw what I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to see is that many of them were filmed along the way. Now, I did not know beforehand, but I saw an Orange County car tag and said: wow! This was filmed in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the flashback from the past and the child's ancestors, but that was it. The murders by the pumpkin man were pretty bad, with the exception of the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, that's fine, but the return of the undead will give you more emotions.
