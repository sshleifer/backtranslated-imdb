Oh, why did it have to end like this? The last film by Laurel and Hardy, from the cuckoo theme crudely arranged (with wrong credit to Hal Roach) to the last "Nice mess" / "I could not help it", this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. . In the middle, their relationship is now constructed solely from uncertain acting, normal dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People think of the King of New York, but Chaplin's final output was not as unworthy as this one. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover in my hand shows them at their best, with all the youthful smiles and radiant skin, with a drawing on the back that says "The photograph in this case is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the movie. "Necessarily? It does not even come close. The film itself sees at least fifteen years more than the photographs that adorn the manga, with Ollie overweight. This is not funny, or comically, as you would normally, but it looks bad and is on the verge of obesity. I would be dead seven years after this movie was made, after a series of blows. Stan, meanwhile, suffers a prostrate problem and dysentery, seems macabre since his weight has plummeted drastically. Every time something bad happens to you, like being crushed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for your life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap gives you fear of being killed. It would last another fifteen years after the completion of this film, and finally he would die of a heart attack in 1965. It is annoying to think that such beloved artists age and die painful deaths. And it is worrying to observe its deterioration, both in health and in performance, on the screen. When I, and, I'm sure, almost everyone else, like to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them in such poor physical health and performing extreme routines at the end of their career is a plague in my happy memories of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are clear from the first credits, which appear on the list not only four writers, but also someone who came up with the concept, and a credit for "gags". So, if Monty Collins was writing the "gags," then what were the other four writing? And in that case, why did Monty Collins pay a fee, given that there is no evidence of a single "joke" in the whole movie? More than 40% of the film is spent traveling to the island of the same name, during which we experienced some of the saddest and most ungraceful scenes in which the children got involved. When I saw the bat scene, I wanted to curl up and die. Infantile ineptitude. However, what kills the movie is that all cast members are bent, unable to speak English. This not only makes the movie unrelated, it also severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their castmates. Directed in a flat manner with an atrocious movie and an absolutely atrocious edition, this contrasts completely with the 2 million dollars spent on it. Frankly, it looks terrible, and while a DVD release can clean the image, the quality of the sound and the image is far inferior to any of his Hal Roach works. <br /> <br /> The "friends" of Stan and Ollie, Giovani and Antoine are bored without charisma that stand out to a large extent against the obsolete repertoire of Laurel and Hardy. This is another important problem with the film, since none of the secondary characters is funny or is related to the innocent mentality of children. The nicknamed hardness shown to L & H ("you, the fat one") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than adorable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of a darker political satire, although it is not, and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than ever, a film that analyzes the problems of immigration and the US Constitution suddenly becomes a topical issue in 2003. Unfortunately, however, beyond a funny scene where Stan is chosen "the people ", this is not the case. Really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humor has its rough edges, or is it a Laurel and Hardy movie where the rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally hit someone in the face, his idea of ​​a good moment? After all the years that Stan and Ollie shared a bed, we also received a definitive reference, since Stan accidentally kissed him, and Ollie got mad at the kiss. The implication is also that the illegal immigrant friend of Stan and Ollie, Antoine, ends his life being devoured by a lion. Of course, I never thought I would see a movie of Laurel and Hardy in which they had to hang up. The need for an intrusive and graceless narrative is one more indicator of how complicated all this is, with the launch in the United States (the same version available in video) eliminating 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unnoticed, this horribly made, implacably ungraceful film serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs.
