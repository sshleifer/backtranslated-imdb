I tried to see this adaptation, but it was so horrible that I could not torture myself that way. The performances were quite below average, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was very above in a paper that should be handled with a certain subtlety. I have studied Shakespeare and I have seen many adaptations, and this is by far the worst I have seen in my life. I have to wonder why someone made this movie on Earth. Shakespeare can, and has been, very well adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I suggest a game to drink? Take a drink every time you leave the book of the original idea and two drinks every time Fonda exaggerates. You should be pretty drunk in a very short time.
