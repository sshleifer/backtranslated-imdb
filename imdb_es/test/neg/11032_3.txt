Taran Adarsh, a renowned critic, praised such a dubba movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants money to save his mother and then forgives him LOL <br /> <br /> The movie is a shit <br /> <br /> the whole first half has its focus on romance, comedy that does not work Torsion affects but the second half is a disaster and the climax is a clich√© <br /> <br /> The direction of Aditya Datt is bad The music is typical of Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan does his serious role well, but his wardrobe, his way of walking through the songs.etc is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel who fails to convince this actor that he was good at MURDER so far and after a descent at Mithun for a while on screen and he is fine, but his break in a song is forced.
