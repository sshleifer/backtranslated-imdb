I do not know in which neighborhoods live the people who wrote the favorable reviews for this film, but I'm glad I'm not there if they do not comment on the caricature of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in movies like the "Die Hard" series, but when we see little Jodie defeating a whole street gang, with a Glock, as NOVICE still ... come on. All she needed was a bald head and a torn shirt and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie, as an executive producer, blinded her to the joke and waste of her money. Or she was living some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and all the others are black or Hispanic brunettes. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (with the exception of a black police officer) everyone else in the city is an unpleasant minority who persecutes her. Has your fear of talent as an actor diminished so much that you think the only way you can make yourself noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on camera in a dark, morose and gloomy neighborhood / movie / cast? Apparently, he thought he was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous grounds, furniture chewing acts, gratuitous violence ("Look girls! Now you can do it too!"). .. Spend time with your family instead of seeing this drek.
