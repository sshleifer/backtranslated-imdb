I want to believe that all the new horror films that come out of Japan these days are avant-garde and are nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Spider Forest is not one of them. <br /> <br /> It's very rare that I ended up seeing something and we ended up wasting time, but Spider Forest was an exception in this regard. I was very angry. The creators of the film were successful on one level; Throughout the film I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery outlined by the story. I could not stop looking. Is that why I was so angry when the movie ended ... I was dragged until 2 hours of boredom by this POC? WARNING: Spider Forest is another one of those stories of Japanese "ghosts", although you do not realize that. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and artificial. "It is a ghost story" has become a large carpet under which you can sweep each and every one of the holes in the plot that you have no solution in your story.
