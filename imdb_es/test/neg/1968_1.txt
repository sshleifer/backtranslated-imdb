Misconceived sequel (... the absurd idea of ​​having the snowman murderer in the turmoil of an island complex where there is no snow or cold weather) returns the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment that provides strange elements that reintroduce life to its molecules (... it's the best I could do to explain this absurd concept). <br /> <br /> I will be able to delve into how he ends up on the island to kill many tourists, but there is simply no reason to bother because everything would be very exhausting. Anyway, the filmmakers think it's wise to kill pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival (... seriously, why bother introducing ourselves even if we can not enjoy our sweet eyes, is not it? ). . <br /> <br /> The murder scene "snow anvil" takes the cake. Ice icicles stick out from the sand on the beach so the victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of cobweb pincers. <br /> <br /> Look at what comes to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie ... like a ridiculous supernatural slasher or it'll tickle you funnybone ("Oh, it's such a horror movie. wonderfully cheesy! ") or you've thought why the hell you're wasting your time with that nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze the water (... so, how could they melt it in the first film?) And it makes the island resort to snow. A sequence has Jack freezing the water in the pool, enclosing a swimming model under the sheet, resulting in him drowning with no place to escape. Oh, there is also a recreation of the "tongue attached to ice cream" bit from The Christmas Story ("Cowatonga dude!"). <br /> <br /> I have to give it to the cast, though ... they are real soldiers for trying to make this unfortunate material entertain. Christopher Allport (... perhaps recklessly) returns like Sam, to face his old nemesis, as Eileen Seeley does, as his wife. The ironic humor attempts (... for me, at least) failed, but the cast soldiers tried to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances that do everything possible to overcome the unfortunate premise. and a nefarious dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is a development that increases the danger for those who are still close to facing Jack, their genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the foreign elements introduced, allow them to resist the refrigerant / anti-freeze, and worse, now it can reproduce ... through indigestion, Jack cuts what appear to be snowballs that hatch to reveal small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth. The killer snowman costume and the little snowball puppets presented later in the film can cause stomach laughter if you're in the mood for those shenanigans, but I personally found this crap pretty moody (that's the purpose, I guess, cheap laughs) ). of those willing to embrace this and unbearable. The offspring of the snowball is an obvious tribute to the Gremlins where we have a scene in a bar where the little bastards celebrate in number by terrorizing the victims in the resort. The weapon against them ... bananas! It is explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, they both fell into a truck bed full of antifreeze (an icicle emerging from Jack's belly was penetrating Sam's chest when he pushed them through a window towards the bed of the truck, and I guess that being "linked" by the icicle, Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy, or that's what we're led to believe!) and in doing so, they both "merge" in a certain sense . <br /> <br /> Few, a movie like this challenges a simple explanation. It is a film with effects and a plot so terrible that one could find the presentation nice because of its many failures.
