The whole exercise is useless. Why make the movie at all? The lighting is frightening, but the sound is just a joke. As a secondary production. Whoever has assembled the budget for this film must draw and divide into four to allow it to be made without the proper budget for sound experts with equipment suitable for recording. <br /> <br /> Therefore, much dialogue is unintelligible due to echo losses or lack of proximity to the microphone. The economy should have been done in any other area. All production is lifeless and simply LAME with a half-height production of amateur type. It lacks warmth, clarity and has no design.
