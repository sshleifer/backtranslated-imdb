The real star of the last of the airport films is the great supersonic company that the French created called The Concorde. If you take into account that the whole film is dedicated to showing what the needle point plane could do in the sky, the whole movie makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you are expecting a serious drama here, that by all means take part of the evasive action that shows Concorde here when some unpleasant people try to tear it down. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a television reporter who is also the lover of the military. The industrial magnate Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's aides has just brought his information about some of Wagner's dirty business, selling weapons to people who are not friendly to the US. UU When the source, Macon McCalman, is murdered in front of her and almost makes him an assassin who escapes, of course he confronts Wagner with the information. And of course he denies it. But just before Blakely boards the Concorde, McCalman's widow, Kathleen Maguire, hands him the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his henchmen try to get down to the big bird. But the intrepid crew of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy lives up to all their tricks. It's pretty full, since you'll see if you want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you will not worry about the plot. It's like the movie Le Mans with Steve McQueen, which has a legion of car racing fans who have turned it into a cult item. Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just did not bother with any kind of story. <br /> <br /> Among the passengers there is a saxophonist smoking marmots played by Jimmie Walker, an anguished mother who accompanies a new heart for her. child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the bathroom. She is really the best here. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner must have been psychic, because I'm sure that thanks to the strength of this film he got the role of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone involved got a great payday from this movie, but it seems to have killed the movie saga of the airport.
