This film is about a young couple fleeing to start a new life in Los Angeles, which ends up being harassed by a psychopath in a deserted rest stop. Actually, it's only about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend disappears literally in a few minutes. The film is moving at great speed, and from the beginning he wonders how he could stretch his story to show the duration. It does not take long before you realize that the movie does this simply by wasting time with unnecessary scenes that do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not only thin, but unstructured, stupid and incoherent. Minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and her car, Nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop. She sees the flash of a camera and KNOWS that people are inside, but she easily gives up trying to get help when no one responds to knocks on the door. After the killer informs him that his boyfriend is in danger, he walks around the rest stop, doing all kinds of stupid and unnecessary things. This includes turning on a TV (and even looking funny when you think you've run into a porn movie, even in this serious situation), sitting, wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end. She does all this KNOW that her boyfriend has been kidnapped, that the killer is still on the loose and harassing her, and without taking any action to guarantee her immediate safety (she does not bother to close the doors or stay alert). Oh yes, she tries to use a radio to ask for help, but why bother when there is a mobile home with people in it Right at the rest stop? It really seems that the scriptwriter forgot this important fact when writing this part of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of entrapment or danger always present in this story. The heroine roams freely through the various buildings at the rest stop, and the killer only drives from time to time to scare her, before leaving again. THERE IS NOTHING that prevents Nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is far away from any other place, it's better than sitting down), but she chooses to stay anyway. At one point in the movie, the main character even RECOGNIZES that he can escape, but he does not. <br /> <br /> The story is not going anywhere, and instead, it simply jumps from a nonsensical segment to a nonsensical segment. Nicole finally gets into the mobile home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of religious fanatics, protected, presumably pure or psychotic. They seem willingly ignorant or indifferent about the murderer's actions (but there is no indication that they are connected to him in any way), and then expel Nicole after several minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the main character wanders in the bathroom building. She discovers one of the killer's previous victims (a young girl named Tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes for a lever to open the closet door, and when she returns a minute later, Tracy and her blood supply have disappeared without explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board that shows many missing people and sees that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. So, was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never bothers to explain. <br /> <br /> Next, a police officer appears in the middle of the night to occupy the police post at the rest stop, which until now had been left unattended throughout the day. Nicole tells him everything that has been going on and, when the killer arrives in his truck outside the office, the policeman comes out to confront him. What does the police officer do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? Go up and talk quietly with the murderer (whom Nicole had even pointed out as the guy who was harassing her), and check the murderer's lie that he was just driving and needed instructions. Seriously. Then, the policeman talks to Nicole outside, not realizing that the truck turns and runs over him. <br /> <br /> The policeman quickly begins to tell Nicole that he is a bum who is "lucky to be breathing" yet, but strangely he does not die for a long time. The two speak a little more pointlessly, and the important fact that he has a gun is annoying, not even mentioned for too long. When the two finally tried to use the weapon, Nicole wasted most of her bullets by firing blindly at a door when the killer was possibly behind her. When two bullets are left, the policeman tells Nicole to use one for euthanasia. She shoots one in her mouth, and he stays still for a moment, with a piece in his head. Then, suddenly and inexplicably he shouts "You missed it!" And she has to shoot him again. I try at once completely cheap. <br /> <br /> Nicole finally faces the killer and fails. The film ends with a scene that takes place not long after that, with a woman arriving at the rest stop, now strangely much more active. In the bathroom building, she hears Nicole ask for help in the closet (locked up like Tracy). She gets a policeman in and checks him, but he finds a closet apparently normal and clean. The policeman leaves, thinking he has been deceived. A battered Nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily seen if the policeman had spent all 10 seconds looking), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there. WOW <br /> <br /> This movie is apparently the first in a new line of direct-to-DVD movies, marketed as too extreme for theaters. Actually, it's just more clich√©, trash from B-Movie.
