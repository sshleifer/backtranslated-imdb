1st Seen 24/6/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK thriller, but a little too predictable. This story is based in Germany, which is also where the movie is made. This is a young medical student who receives an opportunity to go to a premiere school in Heidelberg and comes to see that some strange things happen. Someone who met on the train there and saved, appears at the school's experimentation table and is suspicious of a dirty game immediately. She does some research and the disappearance of her friend takes her to a secret society called AAA (and it's not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-hypocritical oath and is used to perform experiments on living people that the doctors did not want. It can usually be done. She finds out that her grandfather (who was dean at school) was an important part of her creation and is quite full of school members. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is the speed with which the audience is told what is happening and then it's a kind of horror movie with the heroine fighting the bad boy of the group that is taking things to the next psychotic level. Even though this film was made in Europe, it is presented to a young American audience with its focus on gore, sex and the premise of the horror movie (which is actually a big downfall) and explains why it probably did good money and resulted in a sequel but not necessarily for a good movie.
