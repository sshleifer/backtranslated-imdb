Right in Colmyster. I totally agree with all your feelings and I add these. I came to my PC especially to post a comment on this terrible (less) Bgrade movie. I was going to say that in this day and age I can not understand how someone could make such a sad movie, but you beat me. Anyone who reads this and Colmyster's comment, trust me: DO NOT waste your time and money. It is an absolute shock. The acting is totally pathetic, the script is much worse, and the (called) special effects are a joke. Surely nobody invested money to make this movie? I really can not think of anything else to say about this so-called horror science fiction product, but I must fill in this comment to make 10 lines of comments so that it is accepted for submission.
