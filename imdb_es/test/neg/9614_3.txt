Not even Hitch 'minor', but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: unimaginative script, static point of view, putrid dress, frightening hair, unpleasant actors and a truly gratuitous rape and strangulation scene. The perverse sense of humor of the director is present, but it is not applied consistently; The film comes alive only in its cruelty. Women are doing especially badly; "Frenzy" could be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, although a better explanation for me is that he may start with his television series and "Psycho", which he himself described as a saving exercise, an experiment for see if a television crew could film an acceptable feature: Alfred Hitchcock had abandoned the art and had decided to trade. In 'Frenzy', the great teacher seems to be bowing to the convention, trying to go with the times and give audiences what they think they want, in the form of unattractive nudity, winks with nudge, and evil in general. I do not envy an old man his rest, but I do not want to remember him tired, lazy and complacent. It's time to see 'Vertigo' again!
