I rented this movie for approximately $ 1.50, the most complete loss of money (and time) I have spent. It's LAME! I could not believe how they could come up with something like this. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no plot. Everything you expect to happen, it does, but in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog ​​could have done better. Special effects have no effect, except to induce total disbelief. And the cheese lines ... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this piece of sh * t are the initial scenes. Actually, they were pretty. And one of the reasons why I decided to rent this. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most real CG of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it below.
