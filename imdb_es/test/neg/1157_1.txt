The story of Ed Gein is interesting, VERY interesting. This movie, however, is interesting only because of the fact that it was actually made. The representation of Kane Hodder by Ed Gein is very far away, not even the funniest thing. Ed Gein did not behave like a psychotic in public, he was very calm and serene, he was always very polite with everyone and spoke with anyone who listened, this is one of the main things that this film could not show to the public. But the biggest mistake of this movie, next to a single frame that was shot, was that Ed never killed anyone without his dead mother having told him, who thought he was speaking from beyond the grave. He killed only the people his dead mother said he had to do because it was God's will, and he regretted it, although that did not stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and the use of people's flesh. Officially I gave this movie a grade of "1" simply because "0" was not given to me as an option. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to see a film that accurately portrays Ed Gein and does not try to include a love story with a secondary argument between a cop and a fictional woman that never existed, I recommend that you watch the original movie, which unfortunately appears even if it is not IMDb.com, I could be wrong, but I have not found it here yet. The original does not move away from real events and does not try to twist the story. I can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie just tried to directly change the actual story itself, something that I find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11, but it gave a twist that Canada was Behind that. Or a World War II movie that says Hitler was a good guy and helped fight the Nazis.
