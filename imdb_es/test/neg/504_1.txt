The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real to the historical photos and all the sounds of the bustle of the old west. Too bad that the producer and writer / director, Michael Cimino, dedicated a zero time to any of the historical facts of what was really the Johnson County War. Much of the war was about how public lands should be used for grazing. The ranchers did not want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. The entire epic makes no mention of sheep grazing, which was one of the most important reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hit men. It shows the peasants surrounding the armed men as they would with a group of Indians in the previous Hollywood films. The fact is that Sheriff William (red) Angus of Johnson County, with a gang of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn on the TA ranch. I doubt that any woman took part in the site. <br /> <br /> Ellen (She is also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a gang of lynchings about three years before the invasion of Johnson County. She was never a prostitute. This was a canard released by the Wyoming Farmers' Association (WSGA) to discredit it. The fact that the plot becomes a brothel of the lady only serves the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were unrelated to the Johnson County War (and the events that led to it) surpasses me. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much more interesting if it had lived on the political ramifications of federal government intervention in the affairs of a state government and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved. for Calvary. Some efforts were made to prosecute the ranchers responsible for the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson County could not afford the costs of the court and the governor of Wyoming, Amos W. Barber, backed the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of runtime on the DVD version.
