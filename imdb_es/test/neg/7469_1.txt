I saw this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was, by far, the worst movie there. It is the use of a complete uncircumcised frontal nudity and a script and an insipid address that does not commit to a new version of 'Maurice' or decides it is a Neil LaBute movie, it left me with the feeling 'Why would someone ruin a perfectly good cast like this? ' He lacks irony and fills the emptiness with feelings, which makes the moments when the film turns on itself make him want to clean his face while his mind and heart look for what might be happening in the film, but it is not. I wish the director and the editor had reissued the film because there may be more stories that could be drawn from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
