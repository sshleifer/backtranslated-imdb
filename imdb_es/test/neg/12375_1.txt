The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for the worst movie of all time. A fake-looking giant vulture attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious movie. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to each other is ridiculous. No wonder that this film is a primary objective in the film, "It Came From Hollywood", where this gem is marked for the line, "A bird as big as a battleship", with jovial and endless. The line relentlessly appears throughout the film, so there is no way to escape. There are several shots of 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' and' Earth vs. The Flying Saucers' among other science fiction movies of the 50s to reinforce vulture attacks. At one point, the big vulture is responsible for a few deaths, so the military puts everyone under martial law and no one can leave their homes. Of course, the big vulture is mainly concerned with chasing the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday, wherever they are. However, the director is so lame that he does not even offer a few photos of the beautiful Mara in a decent dress and black heels to alleviate a little the tedium of this zero-star thriller. It is the second time that this mistake is made. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday walks in hot dresses throughout the film, but is relegated to the pants, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this movie must have been no more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt that Morrow or Corday have won more than three thousand. It seems that everything was taken out of someone's garage.
