This is the third movie in a month that I've seen that was not as expected. The first two were The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, none of which gave new ideas of who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated by UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO research that it was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have defended the performance, camera angles, stereotypes if there was a good story about UFO hunting, but none here. I'm not saying there was anything wrong with the subject, but Netflix presented this film as a skeptical UFO and a UFO believer who investigates multiple locations. <br /> <br /> I stopped seeing almost in half. I can not believe I lost so much time with this one. Please, do not make the same mistake as me.
