I have seen many (possibly too many direct movies to the video, without a budget and I have developed a taste for "good" ones, or those that are less imbecile, as ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha). DR. CHOPPER, that's what I kindly refer to as ... absolute garbage. None of that is nice: the performance sucks, the characters suck, the killer stinks, the blood is minimal ... and it stinks. This is a group of friends from the university who drive to a newly discovered family cabin, owned by the parents of one of the children. It is intended to be a relaxing retreat, but little do they know that a deceased former plastic surgeon, along with his two female aides, are looking for useful tissue to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper, since he travels on a motorcycle and, of course, chops. This is just a terrible movie, which does not deserve anyone's time. Enough talk.
