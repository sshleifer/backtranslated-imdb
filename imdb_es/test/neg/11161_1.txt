The whole configuration of this Disney family movie (ad-exec gets a horse for his teenage daughter because "he wants one more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the great horse show at the end. . All the other ingredients (the advertising campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a possible boyfriend for the young man, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival for Dean Jones for the affections of Diane Baker) are filed near the end simply to show the horse. More than half of the image is filler and, what is worse: it is plaintive and unpleasant. The boy is the ninny guy who cries on the couch with a dog in his arms, and as usual gets away with it. * since ****
