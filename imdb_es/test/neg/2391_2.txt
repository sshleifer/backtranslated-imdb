What better way to describe it than furry criminals on television? And I do not mean in the COPS show; here, they are actually being presented as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see any corrective value in this show unless I have a perverse inclination for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; A star that Bobby Brown helped pull the sky. Bobby Brown is not more than a criminal of the low one. Why look at it? Why does Whitney support him no matter how despicable he may be? This couple should be locked in and it is a shame they are making money and achieving some fame by observing the septic tank that is their life and the human waste that is their character.
