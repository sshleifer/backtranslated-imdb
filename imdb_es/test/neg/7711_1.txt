I will keep it in vignettes, so here it goes: 1. Very badly written. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Slow and docile zombies a minute to the next minute Crazy furious. 4. I never saw that the blood cleansed so easily! 5. Special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. Act not as good as "Bold and the beautiful". 7. It seems that it was written in 1 week and done the following week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med team and the Special Forces enter a university infested with zombies to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. . All die, except the 2 main stars, so predictable, although unarmed and swarms of hundreds of zombies survived. However, the special forces (who were trained in the kindergarten school scouts) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. Also the mandatory pull on the hand to fill any gap. General garbage load.
