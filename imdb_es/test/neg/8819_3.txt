This first film by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") does not really pump my notes as I expected. In fact, it bothered me. It is a theater company that sails to a funeral island, formed by dead criminals, where they plan to conjure up some evil forces and resuscitate some corpses ... The leader of his group, a presumed enthusiast of black magic and possible homosexual, tries summons the help of Satan with the re-animation of an exhumed body, which fails, so they take the corpse to the house of the nearby and abandoned caretaker and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or more less, when the undead finally sprout. Their graves and go after the profaners. The makeup effects are fine, the gore is VERY minimal (PG rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on too much, which really got on my nerves. I suppose having a group of terrible actors arguing for an hour would amount to equaling the status of "comedian", but I found no humor whatsoever. The whole concept is simply ridiculous: the way in which these children are willing to unearth and make monkeys with a corpse during the time they did it. The characters are stereotyped and dull and the movie is just boring ... Do not waste your time with that ...
