This movie is about the worst I've seen in a long time. The talent of Terence Stamp is totally lost and the only thing I enjoyed was listening to one of my favorite songs, "If I Had a Million Dollars" by BNL, in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who stays at home sitting by his boss. The misadventures continue. Bla bla bla. If you have time to kill and you have nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, look something else. <br /> <br /> There is not necessarily a moment of redemption, but it's good to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. It is always a pleasure to see them, although this film managed to cushion even these bright spots.
