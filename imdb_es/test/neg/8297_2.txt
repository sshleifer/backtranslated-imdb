I was wondering when someone would try to turn all that disaster in Matamoros into a goreporn picture. Anyway, here are some things that I learned about Mexico when watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are super attractive. Do you remember that little desert city in Unearthed? Yes, well, this must be the sister city of Mexico. Do not even bother with prostitutes, just make some gentle movements in the hot bartender. She will be as good as prostitutes and probably does not have children too! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by the madmen of Palo Mayombe who worship Satan. Oh no! The other half, as all Americans know, is run by drug dealers. Fortunately, this does not interfere much with the sex tourism trade and our ultra low wage factories there. <br /> <br /> ~ The Mexican policemen are useless. Do not go to them. Go to the nearest hidden bookstore and ask the hot girl behind the counter what happened to her missing friend. She will be much more helpful than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ When you are being horribly tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, do not actually recite the Psalms or any part of the Bible. You will only ruin the mojo.
