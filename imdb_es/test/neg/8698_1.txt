This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time ... in the first 10 minutes I was already upset because I am familiar with the real version of the story according to the Torah (5 books of Moses) ... but I decided to see it for My money is worth it and also to see how badly he sucked it. Well, it stunk ... a lot more than I thought. First and for the majority, let's start with the script and the characters the skeleton that forms the body of a movie. If you study Torah at all, you will see that the story is wrong here. Some of the mistakes are disastrous: Moses does not do slave labor because he was in the tribe of Levi, Moses does not kill anyone at Mount Sinai. But, nevertheless, the film shows Moses being whipped, and Aaron and himself killing people ... not really! When Moses speaks to the burning bush, he knows who speaks too, but the film makes Moses look like an idiot, he says he does not know who the gd is in the bush ... Aaron knows his brother well, regardless of A As they grew up, Aaron was known for his serene, calm and quiet nature, but in this film he is shown as angry and arrogant. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie ... how ridiculous ... pharoah the real one was actually and an ugly midget who was sitting on a pyramid of stairs so he could look bigger than he was and Moses had more than 10 feet and in the movie Pharoah is taller than him and is hot with clear eyes! The woman of Israel (nation of Israel) covered herself with her hair and body, and they did not dance or sing in front of the men, they did not participate in the golden calf, so they definitely would not dance with a man in public like the movie represents The wife of Moses, Tzipora, was married to moses and, therefore, she covered herself and, being as humble as them, she did not curl up or take her hand in public. The daughter of Batia Pharoah (the one who adopts and saves him from the water) was converted to Judaism and, therefore, would have been proud of Moses when he said he was going to free his people. time with two sets of tablets ... with gibberish written on it ... at least put the script in the sacred language, Hebrew or English and put it on a tablet, not in two games ... The conclusion is that the movie It is written horribly, directed and all the characters are wrong ... basically, EVERYTHING is wrong with the film ... The old one is also inaccurate, but it is more realistic, and the actors are credible. I'm Israel Chai!
