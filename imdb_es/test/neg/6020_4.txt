CLASSIFICATION OF STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his work and to be a good father to his two daughters after a messy divorce from his mother (Maxine Peake). But after an altercation with those daughters present at the Working Men's Club, he used a trip to his dance class to catch a glimpse of Louis (Colin Salmon) and his band of tough men training in the boxing gym / boxing section. free weights there and train to become a harder and assertive person. In a short time, he has taken Louis' philosophy very seriously and joined him as a nightclub doorman when the phobia of the 80's club begins ... but when associate Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to make a sideline in drug trafficking, everything becomes pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once said in the movie A Bronx Tale, "there is no tragedy bigger than the lost talent". The writer of Clubbed had a good idea and a great talent to turn it into a kind of film ... but without the ability, apparently, to bring it all together in a kind of coherent film. <br /> <br /> Like a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the end of the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot ... but the harsh aspect of the Cinematography is really a disappointment. . However, some really poor actors, for example the main actor Raido with an indecipherable accent, and a hammy script with some false dialogue are major problems for the film. The most established actors, like Peake and even the favorite of the television Neil Morressey, are marginalized of very small support parts, while the disastrous Raido and the villain of Ronnie Fox are the protagonists. Williams gives the impression of Sick Boy from a poor man from Trainspotting, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes apparently the only artists left with any integrity of all this, while excessive and blood-spattered violence (it becomes a common tendency for British movies!) Take over. Truly a missed opportunity. **
