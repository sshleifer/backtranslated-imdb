"Theft Time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled "Rennie's Landing". Which explains how director Marc Fusco could afford this cast of established television / film actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. Approximately ten minutes into the film, you understand why this thing never had a theatrical premiere after having made the rounds of the film festival several years ago. <br /> <br /> Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects the perception that the growing popularity of certain cast members can be harnessed to recover some of the modest production costs. Although they are not a great addition to anyone's resume, young actors have done worse when they were desperately looking for acting work of any kind. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play university friends yes. an early meeting of "Big Chill" and compare war stories about the failure of reality to live up to your dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of an assault on a liquor store and a robbery to a bank, which are then organized in a "cheap and deaf" way to completely inappropriate music. It is banking work less suspense since W.C. Fields was the guard in "The Bank Dick." <br /> <br /> If someone can point to any time in "Theft Time" in which something "really" happens, I would like to know, because, as far as I can tell, nothing happens in the whole movie. . Maybe Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of life before it's too late. Like "The Fire of St. Elmo," the film is filled with every deep thought ever uttered by a young adult who left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I felt that Fusco was going to go for a guy from Howard Hawks. Young professionals in action "Only angels have wings". On the other hand, I'm sure he was reading too much in the movie. After all, things really happen in the Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a boy
