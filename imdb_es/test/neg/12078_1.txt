The 80s were the best and worst times for James Karin, he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he performs in this piece of ... this bad movie. A sequel to Hardbodies (but not really), has a group of rather unpleasant characters trying to make a film in Greece. Through design or laziness, the line between the film and the "movie inside a movie" is not only blurry, but it does not exist from scene to scene (which would be confusing if only I was interested in something that happened in the movie in the film). First place. Unfunny would be too generous a term. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio, and many other extras are topless; Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> My rating: DVD extras from F <br /> <br />: only "Hardbodies" trailers, "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory" "(it comes in a double-function DVD with the first movie, for masochists)
