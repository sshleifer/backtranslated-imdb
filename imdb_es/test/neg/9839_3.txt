It is a pity that a film with such a good cinematography had no argument to be supported by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (film editing), and above all, has no idea of ​​what happens in Mexico . City. The film tries to be a very realistic representation of life in the city, but is unable to do so. It's a shame, a lot of wasted film. An American woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnapped. The first story of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to have a better narration of the test, especially when it comes to the attitude of the staff of the US embassy in Mexico City. , when it comes to a problem like this. Compare, for example, with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar subject. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, with All Power (1999). It is worth watching the movie if you want to get an idea of ​​the appearance of the city, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists that require a fairly extensive suspension of disbelief. Who will believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City will go to the end to catch the main characters of the US-Mexico border? UU.? And that this policeman will be able to use his radio from the border to Mexico City! Only the producers of this movie. It is worth mentioning that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least in these Mexicanas Spanish is spoken.
