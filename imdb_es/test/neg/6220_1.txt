After reading this movie, I decided that it is one of the worst movies I've seen. I knew it the moment I was subjected to three teenage girls who shouted and acted excessively when (my God!) They met again, and then they watched the same thing, only done by women big enough to be my mother. And that was only the first minutes. Yeesh So here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + complete ridiculous dance moves with hip thrusts and exaggerated costumes = not a good idea. <br /> <br /> 2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing out of a paper bag. In fact, I could not practically anyone else in this pile of excrement. <br /> <br /> 3. The songs were so random. For me it was obvious that they were thrown, at least, to the incredibly artificial and STUPID plot. <br /> <br /> 4. My three-year-old nephew could have written a better script. <br /> <br /> I was shrinking or laughing mockingly during the movie. And I usually like musical movies a lot. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny ... but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean, you have excellent actors and actresses in this movie ... I'm ashamed that this is part of his career. I regret losing my money and time in this garbage.
