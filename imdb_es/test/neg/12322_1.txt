Well, the previews seemed fun and I usually do not go to the movies on opening night, especially with my children because ... well, you never know. Here is a movie that does not appeal to children or adults, since jokes are too perverse for children and are completely flat to entertain adults. Actually I was ashamed to be with my 9 and 6 year old son and have to explain to my 6 year old son what S H * T spells. Essentially, what happens here is a total twist of Dr. Seuss's classic. Add an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of the children for their money. If that were a secondary plot, it might have been fine, but it ends up being the main plot of the whole film and "the cat" plays a more important role in the exposure of the neighbor to the mother for what it really is. Follow my advice and read the book and broadcast the movie.
