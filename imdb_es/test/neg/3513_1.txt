The silly, nonsensical movie should appeal to the Rednecks of the South, the teens with IQ IQ and the average Bush supporter. Noble Willingham is the protagonist of this simplified script for what it is and uses a generous dose of MFers, eff this and eff that and SOBs. The ending that I anticipated to "save" this hollow story was the biggest disappointment, leaving me hanging and wondering: "Why?" It's a cat and mouse story or more like Bully versus victim. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you like to hear the phone ring every 2 minutes and constant curses and screams throughout these 123 minutes of garbage dumps.
