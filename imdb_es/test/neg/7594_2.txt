New Year's Day. The day after consuming too many vodka and cosmopolitan martinis mixed with a bunch of champagne at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company is offering the digital specialty channels for free during the month of January. We had a choice: do we use the free channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas? <br /> <br /> We choose for the free digital gift. since the DVDs are not going anywhere and we need something like ten days of twelve hours to see all the X files from start to finish. The Drive-In channel offered a marathon of three classic horror films: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). The asylum is well reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum came too late for us to see, which meant that in reality we could only be critical to the House of the Damned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we try to be serious with the movie, since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials: Greg Evigan (Tekwars overwritten by William Shatner) and Alexandra Paul (the only baby from Baywatch that could act even if you have the body of a ten-year-old child). Unfortunately, soon we dissolved in giggles, under the influence of a small dog hair, while shouting the names of the movies from which this dog borrowed his scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted. Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> The performance, especially by Evigan's real-life daughter, was not so bad considering the stupid script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious: at its worst in the final scene, when it should have been the most horrible, it was so bad that my wife and I dissolved into laughter. <br /> <br /> In general: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
