I'm a big fan of the genre The ABC Movies of the Week. I'm only 27 years old, which means I was not even born until after the show ended, but I'm trying to collect as many of them as possible on DVD. I have a dozen or so. I had read such wonderful things about this movie, both here and elsewhere, that I was really excited to see it. I just received my DVD in the mail today and I saw it with anxiety. I admit that the first or two phone calls gave me chills, the voice of that boy would give chills to anyone! But it started erasing quickly and the whole secondary plot of divorce was stupid. I also noticed that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the film ended. As soon as that story was told about how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked up her mother, I knew something was suspicious. Besides, did anyone think of asking him why he suddenly appeared that night when the barn fire broke out? I admit that I thought he was training a child at school to make phone calls. I did not guess the part of the dumb child or the prerecorded recordings (did they ever say who the voice was that it really was? Do I doubt Douglas can have his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> I'm just giving this movie a four out of ten because I really liked most of the acting in it. Ashley is especially good. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because this movie has a great premise, but hey, that's what happens sometimes when you have your hopes for a movie too much.
