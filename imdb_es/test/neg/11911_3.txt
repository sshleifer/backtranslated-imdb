Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors who had adorned the screen. He could easily move from dramatic roles to comedians with ease, making most of his classmates turn green with envy. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is worthy of an Oscar, I think he was granted as he had lost his other opportunities to win the prize due to other better roles that had preceded this current. <Br /> <br /> This is also one of those pretentious films that goes out basically to show the talent of the cast, or in this case, a particular member. It's a pity that the screenwriter's output does not match that of Lemmon. Do not waste your time with this.
