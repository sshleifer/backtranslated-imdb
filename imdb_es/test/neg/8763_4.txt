One of the most animated roles of John Carradine as an implied Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich, is one of Schlockmeister's most animated and low-budget actors. Without meaning, fighting against the brain, I can only obey the simplest orders ... a bit like McDonald's staff. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name, since the United States was not at war at that time. they filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys work for! <br /> <br /> There seem to be two types of zombies in the movie, the traditional type of popular voodoo in the old black and white films of the 1930s and '40s. Eyes blank and just follow another person's orders as they stumble. And then there's the guy we know from later films like "The Night of the Living Dead" and "The Dead of Evil." They still roam around but only with the intention of killing and eating the flesh and brain of their victims. Both have their moments in several movies over the years. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' presents the old type of zombie, although they are particularly silly looking and would look more like home in a yesteryear that monsters show as geeks when they bite chickens. A black zombie named Lazaro with his wild hair, looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the evil doctor decides to turn his wife into a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his own. Error. Even though he allows her to keep her heels in strips like a nice feminine touch while making her one of the living dead, she's not happy about that. <br /> <br /> Everything is terribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the story should be, never, never, turn your wife into a zombie, is only asking for problems ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting enough and quickly comes to an end, but never rises above its origins in the poverty line. It's not a patch in any true zombie classic, but the fun is the same.
