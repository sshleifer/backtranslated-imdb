In short, this movie is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Almodovar is easily the most important European filmmaker of the 80s and 90s. No other director in life has molded the style and content of today's European cinema more than he does. Therefore, it is not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two mediocre films, but rather a complete and total disaster that confirms that he has run out of ideas, without humor and, worst of all, empathy for the characters. he creates. <br /> <br /> That is not due to the complexity of the story. All of Almodóvar's films are almost impossible to summarize. This time, in fact, it is quite easy if you are familiar with your previous work. "Broken Embraces" is a remake of "Law of Desire", only this time the director is heterosexual and the jealous lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not familiar with that movie, 'I'm making a summary. If you do not want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who used to be a famous film director, seduces a sexy busty woman who reads a newspaper after a casual meeting on the street (yes, really, that's how it starts). Just then he receives the visit of his agent and his best friend. He mentions that he has learned from the newspaper that a certain millionaire has died, which makes history go back 14 years ago. You can still see and you are about to direct your next movie. He stars in the inexperienced lover of said millionaire as the protagonist, since he is instantly beaten with her. The millionaire discovers his adventure through silent videos made by his gay son, who has synchronized with the lips by an interpreter (some great scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent disputes, the mistress escapes with the director to a spa where she learns that the millionaire, who produced the film, threw it in the worst possible edition, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director goes blind and the aspiring actress dies. Back in the present, he learns that his agent has retained the negative aspects of the film and begins to reconstruct it. <br /> <br /> As in "Bad education", there are several sub-plots to reinforce this rather thin story, and as in "Bad education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has an accidental overdose of drugs, which is completely unnecessary for the plot, and is also interpreted quite badly. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors should not do it. Guilt, but the way your characters are written. Blanca Portilla, as an agent, has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. Lluis Homar is the dream of a protagonist of an old man, who lives in an artificial world where an English alias and some sweet words can seduce any supermodel. And Penelope Cruz is the incarnation of this old man's sexual fantasy. Your character is completely lifeless. It remains completely incomprehensible why he would go from being an old man, that at least he helped his family, to a man a little less old, who is not charming enough to convince him of a romantic hero or passion. <br /> <br /> But all these deficiencies would not make this movie so horrible. However, Almodóvar does the worst thing that can make a director (or any type of narrator) run out of ideas: he cites himself, something he has done more and more, and with very little benefit. The film within the film, which uses "Broken Embraces" as a plot management device, is actually "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (1988), only this time it is called "Chicks and Suitcases". This rather unimaginative title can give you an idea of ​​how this beloved classic is treated here: while the dialogue that composes the last ten minutes of "Broken Embraces" is a frantic and exaggerated exchange of strange phrases in the original movie, here is a Business meeting severe, colorless, annoying. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the DOA a creation of an exhausted creator of past wonders, as horrible and disappointing as the last Indiana Jones movie. Maybe not many people would agree with that, because Almodóvar used to be such a genius. I prefer to offer my respect to their achievements humbly asking the reader to see "All about my mother", or "Tie me up", or "High heels", or "Matador", all of which are witnesses of the singularity of Almodóvar. and unparalleled talent. A few more movies like this, and his legacy could well be destroyed forever.
