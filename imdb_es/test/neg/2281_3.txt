By-the-numbers, Oscar's biopic about the late and great singer Ray Charles. There is one - exactly one - great scene in * Ray *. It happens during a flashback to Charles's youth, after the child becomes completely blind. Running to the sharecroppers' house that he shares with his mother, he stumbles over a chair and lies down on the ground. He cries for his mother; She, according to her philosophy that a person must "stand on their own feet," observes silently and thoughtfully from the kitchen, waiting to see if the child can draw on their own resources. The child proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside a window, the drag of a cricket through the plank floor board. <br /> <br /> The movie stops, here; it expands breathes, if only for 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed respite from the noisy Taylor Hackford movie. By "noisy" I do not mean music, which is, of course, excellent. I AM referring to the sound effects (big BOOMS! Which precede another flashback) and the inane dialog box ("I'm talking to you as a FRIEND, Ray," etc.). In the visual aspect, Hackford is equally eye-catching and pointless: sepia filters on camera lenses during flashbacks; rotating dervish 360 camera-crane, etc. etc. All modern comforts. What a horrible cinematic style is shown in * Ray *! - a very common style in the "important" films of wanna-be of the last decade (the * Aviator * by Scorsese is stylistically very similar to this movie). These tricks are used to obfuscate the script full of clich√©s. Some of us will not cheat. <br /> <br /> Some of us are also not prepared to accept the performance of Jamie Foxx as anything more than an excellent imitation. Granted, Foxx looks like Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, talks like Charles and even moves like Charles. The imitation of the singer during Foxx's live performance is technically perfect. I'm not envying Mr. Foxx with his Oscar; he deserved it. (Anyway, it was a pretty weak field this year). But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTAND Charles. The actor achieves a great moment when he insists on proving the slap that his bandmates are shooting: he records, if only for a brief moment, a distaste for the injustice of being blind and a life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the brilliant salvation of music and the oblivion of the heroine, with her blindness as the battlefield between those two compulsions. But the damn movie simply will not take the time: it bounces from triumph to triumph, and never stops to understand the man. One has to STRETCH to find dramatic tension; One must supply the drama for the movie. In other words, one must imagine a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> In his haste towards a glorious conclusion, * Ray * presents, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a film: his first days onwards. the "Chitlin Circuit"; His bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label; The problem of his addiction to heroin. the inevitable artistic commitments that accompany overwhelming success; The importance of man in the fight for civil rights (mentioned in the film during approximately 3 minutes of screen time) and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any of these elements. Two and a half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another can make us feel good, but that film is not necessarily a great work of art. This type of approach certainly does not provide a deeper insight into the subject of the film, and should not the vision be the real purpose of a movie like this? If I had wanted a list of Ray Charles's accomplishments, I would have simply searched on Google. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10: the 2 additional stars strictly for music.
