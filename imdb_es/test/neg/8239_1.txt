While I was sitting watching this episode, I kept looking at the clock waiting for something to happen. As the time approached, I thought that they were really going to give us a big bang at the end, and then, nothing. The whole family is huddled around the Christmas tree like something from the Hallmark Canal, then fades to black. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the poorest season finals I've seen. Nothing at all to animate any emotion for the next season. The only thing that was ruled out as an incentive to see the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while kicking a sandwich sandwich that the boys of New York were looking for to get one of the New Jersey. Wow, really? I would never expect something like that from the mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It almost seems that they are trying to make everyone lose interest. They begin more lines of plot that end up disappearing that any other program that has seen. They mock and insinuate, but rarely deliver more. <br /> <br /> What about the Arabs who hang out at the Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and, magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie puts a little on her knees to a boy after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to his son and, poof, disappeared by the wind. <Br /> <br /> And how many more serpentine drug sets with Christopher are we going to have to endure? Please, have him arrested, take an overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> This was one of the few programs I used to expect, but now, forget it.
