George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact that no matter how poor the film in which he appeared, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and become a good performance. "The crazy monster" is not an exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor movie (although entertaining). Obviously, the filmmakers did not know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems to have occurred in a day or two. Still, Zucco is fine and is credible as the mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is nice at the camp level. In general, fans of horror movies will not like the PRC movies. However, these productions of "Poverty Row" have a small but loyal cult following. Occasionally, they would rise above their limitations and the "Detour" would be the best example of this. Usually, they looked like this. For all its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is a pretty fun way to kill a rainy afternoon. The DVD of Retromedia is recommended, since it combines this with another production of PRC "The Black Raven", the original theatrical trailer, and best of all is an interview with Glenn Strange talking about his role in this film. (4/10)
