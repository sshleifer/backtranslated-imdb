If you saw the series and love the league like me, then be prepared to be disappointed. I went to the movies with a group of fans of the league and we all agreed that this movie was not as funny or dark as the three previous series. In my personal opinion I was a spinner of money. The writing was devised and the plot confused, do not confuse, just confused with what you were trying to do. It was the complacency of the worst kind on the part of writers who are much more talented than my regrettable criticism. I hope that at least the league can be honest enough with itself and recognize that this film is inferior to the three excellent series. I will not buy it despite having most of the memories of the league.
