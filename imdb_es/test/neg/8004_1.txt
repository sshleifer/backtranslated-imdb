This movie could have been much better if they did not use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they did not start the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I had Absolutely no idea what was going on. There were too many double crosses and twists in the plot for the movie to be credible. The movie deserves a 0, but since I do not have a 0, I gave it a 1. I would not recommend this film to my worst enemy , I would prefer to take my eyes off with some rusty scissors that come back to see this movie. I tell you that it was an hour and a half of my life that I will not return. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a gangster movie, do not understand this. Instead, see "Going Off Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."
