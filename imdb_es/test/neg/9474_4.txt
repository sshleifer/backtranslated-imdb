First, let me get this from my chest. I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately, the opening sequence all goes downhill. In the first place, there was no plan to start, just an excuse for Moore to tell his jokes. Below are several sequences that would make a Bond fan tremble, for example, the sequence in which Bond appears to spread a bomb dressed as a clown. The villains are quite poor, Louis Jordon can not make an impact, as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people debate what is the worst Bond and Octopussy movie, it gets overlooked when you can give them an opportunity for their money.
