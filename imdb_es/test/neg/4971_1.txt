In 1993, Sega released a boring and mediocre video game from one of the greatest movies of all time. Upon quickly realizing their mistake, they released a different version of the game, claiming that it would be bigger, harder and better. <br /> <br /> None was. Both were slow and boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be Dr. Alan Grant or ... a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why is Dr. Grant going around killing all those army guys (what are they doing in the game)? And why is a Raptor killing other Raptors? Strange. <br /> <br /> Obviously not learning from his first mistake Sega really dropped the ball in the original release and in the so called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and boring platform games I've played.
