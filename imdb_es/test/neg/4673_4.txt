Half of the film is flashing lights and camera shaking. The rest is made up of predictable characters (think of science versus government, 'know-how' vs. authority, etc.). <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Are the cars that are released in the first 5 minutes, is the horrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut', are the characters not inspired, the first 40 badly integrated hits or the vitriol "United States will save the world"? No. It's the fact that, regardless of the "sad" ending, there's very little suspense in this movie, we basically know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this film: "American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!"
