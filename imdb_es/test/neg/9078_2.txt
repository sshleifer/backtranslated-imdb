The Evil That Men Do (1984) was one of the few films that were not Cannon that Charlie Bronson made during the 80s. Unlike most of the Cannon movies that Charlie starred in, it was not fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and mistreats people for more than an hour and a half. If you thought Mr. Emoci√≥n was before, wait until you see this! <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie goes to a Central American country without a name and shows the population that whoever mess with Chuck or his people has to pay him. This is not fun. It is not cheesy or corny, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I did not like this one. I do not have love for this movie. There are no recommendations because they are not worth seeing. Maybe if they did not drive him crazy. Observe with caution. <br /> <br /> Do not get upset.
