I was very disappointed in this movie. The line on the label was something like 'The story of a girl's sexual awakening'. You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at the time and I took my girlfriend to see him. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagged. Unfortunately that was not the case. I guess we were not ready for a deep and meaningful film that required an element of sophistication that we did not have at that time. I'm not so sure I own him now, and for a long time I've parted from that particular girlfriend (pity ... my first love). We left the cinema in the middle of the movie, my friend, who should have known better, stayed all the time. I still got the required result with my girlfriend, the movie just did not help much. It would be interesting to see him again in order to make a more informed criticism, although I feel that the experience has left me marked for life.
