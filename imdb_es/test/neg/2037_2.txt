I had nothing to do before going out one night, so I did not want to see anything too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone he slept with, director Raja Gosnell has done nothing but nonsense and the writing of this is simply outrageous. In which high school can you register without a parent present and without proof of age or previous education? Did they let all the kids come to the shirtless prom, with tight tights, shorts and a girl dressed as Eve wearing only fig leaves? Does she announce that she is 25 years old and her brother is 23 but that there are no reprisals from the school, parents or any kind of trial against the newspaper for fraud or espionage? The head of the newspaper wants to catch the teacher in a sexual scandal of minors, but does not realize that the teacher is reaching a boy of 25 years, so that any case would be a trap? Do you allow a camera and record private conversations of people with underage children? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera and filmed underage girls for use by my staff, would not I get into some kind of problem? NAHHHH No problem. Did not I have to go to the gym or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what is believed to be high school students and they were all a stereotype. Jessica Alba is shamefully bad in this assault on the camera at every opportunity. In what world do not parents suspect when the school student miraculously asks his super geeky daughter for the prom? And they do not ask the boy who is inside to meet him like any other father in history. If a boy from my school or any other school had cheated on my sister and thrown eggs in her party dress, she would have been in a body cast for the rest of her life. This film is so artificial and predictable that it is nauseating, and why in the end do all (the Alpo girls are included) applaud this girl when two days before they hated her? SILLY.
