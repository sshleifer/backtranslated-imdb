After seeing this piece of trash, you'll know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the correct word for that ...) are mostly sub-standard (around 98%) and do not lose any line of slam. Save the money and get drunk. You could enjoy this movie being totally wasted, maybe!
