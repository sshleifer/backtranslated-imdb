I got a discount copy of this. I had seen it several years ago. My only recent experience had been "Mystery Science Theater", in which I was completely falsified. You never really have the chance to get into these movies because of the whole game. I love the beginnings of the fifty horror films. They give us a pompous lecture on defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should be useful, given the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, despite their exoskeleton made from the things that grasshoppers are made of, they can still defend themselves against air-to-air missiles and disable combat aircraft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's more fun - first, the compulsory messy case that saw the flying thing, chilling the heels in a hospital (just teaches one - see an insect as big as a house-- Keep your mouth closed). I wonder if the poor man had to go home after finding the mistake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a fairly common effort. Follow the usual efforts to find a way to dissuade the stubborn mistake, and leave us open to other possibilities: the Russians next time. I still love these movies and this one is useful.
