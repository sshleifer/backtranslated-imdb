The veteran television director, Ted Post, presents a complacent, confusing and, ultimately, meaningless story, raised from Column B of the Great Book of Harold Robbins Plots. Located on a smoggy Phoenix skyline, Jaclyn Smith after Charlies Angles takes a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times," while JFK impersonator James Franciscus rests around the fringes. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, monkeys are mistreated, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a giallo-style recap takes the whole mess to the end. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and Bob Mitchum is also there. Somewhere.
