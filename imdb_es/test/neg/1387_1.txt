Did you find the title funny? Oh, you did not? Well, that's because you're tense. Learn to laugh because if you do not laugh, you are not living. So, please, reduce your standards with respect to what you think is funny to a simple infant. Now you find it fun? Not yet?! OK, that's because you're full of yourself and you get offended too easily. If you are not laughing, you are not living. And if you do not like me, send me a hate mail to write another review and indicate how much hate mail I get and try to twist it to make it look like I'm a bad bastard. Are you laughing at my hilarious title yet? Not yet?!?! Ok that's it! You are a racist! You have to laugh or else you are racist. Why else would you laugh? Oh, it's not funny! No, this can not be why. I want it to be fun so that's why it is! Laugh, damn it! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok that's it. Where is my notebook and pen? And where are my Richard Pryor DVDs? I need to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thanks thanks. <br /> <br /> This is basically what you will get from Mencia for approximately 23 minutes. Please, do yourself a favor and change the channel when this vague show is activated. Even basic cable channels have things 100 times better than this. I'm not even saying this because I hate it. I'm serious. This show is like watching the grass grow. Although I'm not sure, at least the grass does not steal jokes. Honestly I'm trying to save your time. I even tried to watch your show. I said to myself "maybe he's not that bad". But no, he is. I disconnected completely when I saw your program. I tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show, but I could not. I went out again, I think I was thinking about something more interesting like making my bed again, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> This is my last thought: there are so many things you can do with 30 minutes, besides seeing this guy scream for nothing for half an hour. Do not see a show that tries to push racism in your face in vain. I can support programs that try to relieve the tension of racial wars, but this guy only provides more racism instead of stopping it.
