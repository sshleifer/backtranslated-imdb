I cringed when I heard the first song of canned laughter in the first few seconds of the show, but I still gave it a try. YOU KNOW when someone offers a line that is just a little funny and you hear a laugh track obviously false explode in a laugh that is a show aimed at imbeciles who need to be told "yes, it's fun, go ahead and laugh". /> <br /> Ugh. I could not stand this show as it was revealed. I can not speak for all; after all, some people like that IDIOTIC show "Stacked" (which makes me want to throw up). I imagine that those who like "Stacked" could also like this nonsense. Some people still get angry with the old "pull my finger". For me, this show is so ingenious and almost original. <br /> <br /> The subjects were old and tired. The jokes were lame and hackneyed. The characters were the ones we've seen everywhere, and the worst of what you can imagine. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like words like belches and neighbors that say "pull my finger" ... You may really like this show. Otherwise ... pass it by. It's stupid, and not in an intelligent or original way. This is almost as old and tired as any show at its premiere.
