Possibly the worst movie I've seen. The person who filmed this movie probably never learned not to shoot directly in bright light. You can not see anything in this movie. It is way to darken. The parts where you can see something, the camera goes directly to a light source to get large flashes of lenses. So you still can not see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can do much better than this. And the low budget is no excuse for this. An editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you could not see anything. Maybe manufacturers should have spent part of their low budget on a preview monitor to see what they shot. The only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can not see the horrible performance. It also covers the sfx shit. People in film schools for beginners make better movies than this. Movies filmed with handheld cameras look better than this.
