The plot for a movie like this is a gift. How can you make a mistake with a gay plot and all the colors and music of India? A story like this is written by itself. I will see almost anything, but this was inadmissible. The sad thing is that whites are the most colorful in the movie. Vanessa was a fuss with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was a big bonbon, but everyone else was so bored. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was very boring. The saving grace was really background music, which made it nice to laugh at the movie, instead of the movie, or not. There are many other best gay movies, ethnic movies, just simple movies. I give a pass to many low-budget films, but this should not have been done, or should have been done by someone else.
