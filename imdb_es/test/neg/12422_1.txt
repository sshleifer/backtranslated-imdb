The legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Do not Let the Sun Catch You Crying") plays a nasty car driver whose career has come to skates (ha ha) because he constantly crashes his car (or while he laments, " I 'm tired of being run over by every fat monkey that gets behind the wheel "). It falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept Nazi motorcyclists, unlikelyly called Jeeter, Banjo, Fats and, er, Linda. Fats are the most pleasant of the group; He took a surfboard on the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts, a kind of Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the cops cheat Steve to catch the evil thieves in the middle of one. of their bank robberies. The gang only steals banks for "kicks, man." I guess they give the money to charity. Steve constantly fails, the cyclists are greased and the whole thing never becomes daring because it is so boring. This movie looks like it was filmed through a paper towel soaked in grease. Not since "Necromantic" has a movie so trampled on my soul. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Fats directed "Deranged", the biopic of Ed Gein starring Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in short: Wild Rebels: Hilarious on MST3K, terrible anywhere else.
