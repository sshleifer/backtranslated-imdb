First of all, this is the worst movie I've seen. That can make you want to see it, but it's not bad in a good way. It's boring, unlikely, badly thrown, ridiculously written, and it lacks cold disaster effects. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or amusement, wallowing in a sense of Japanese singularity and victimhood. Everyone abandons the Japanese in their hour of need. Particularly the Koreans. The noblest characters choose the seppaku: they descend with their ship while their beloved island sinks. "Only the Japanese would think this way," says the prime minister. <br /> <br /> If this movie reflects in any way the Japanese opinion about its place in the world opinion, the first thing that they should do to correct the problem is Stop making films like this.
