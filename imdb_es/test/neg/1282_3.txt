All Grown up had a lot to live and there was a lot of enthusiasm when this show was announced. Now it's easy to explain why it did not live up to expectations: first, this program failed to create a realistic world of pre-teens the way the Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of young children. Secondly, the characters of the program are stereo type (Angelica: white spoiled blonde unlike Suzie: girl of modest family color, ...) or bored (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). Finally, there is not an ounce of innovation or an original plot. In short, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a series of sequels to a program like Rugrats. It's boring, it lacks imagination and it seems that the producers do not even know how children from 10 to 13 behave. To be precise, should not Angelica and Suzie compare the size of the bras instead of fighting for who is better at doing the tasks?
