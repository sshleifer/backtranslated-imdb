<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations regarding low budget art films. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of shine in him, that terrestrial and intellectual anti-Hollywood vibes, both Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, that make him a favorite of critics from the beginning. <br /> But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just is not. <br /> <br /> It's meandering. It has too many characters. His tone is uneven, his point of view is confused, the performance is general, from naturalist to superior. He persists for long moments with minor characters that do not matter to us and moves away from tense scenes when things are getting right. <br /> <br /> The brand is lost. <br /> <br /> The worst The flaw in the film is that the two things closest to a protagonist, Marly by Edie Falco and Desiree by Angela Bassett, are straight-faced characters who have no unity. Marly is an apathetic drunk, steeped in the very inertia of her life. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. When the worldviews of the two main characters can be summarized with the phrases "I do not care" and "I want to leave here", why should the public give a rat potato? <br /> <br /> I Will be clear: Sayles write funny dialogues. He is very skilled at drawing a scene. The problem is that these scenes are not going anywhere. There is no spine to the movie. Without unity The film does not create interest of rooting in any of the characters. In my opinion, he is too preacher about the fact that the big American corporation is badly engulfing the little one. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a quality "small" movie, see "Straight Story" by David Lynch. Pass this one.
