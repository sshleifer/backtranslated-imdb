I love science fiction and I'm willing to put up with a lot. Science fiction / TV movies generally do not have sufficient funds, are underestimated and are not well understood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it's a good science fiction TV as Babylon 5 is for Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard games, forced dialogues, CG that does not match the background and painfully one-dimensional characters can not be overcome with a "science fiction" configuration. (I'm sure there are some of you who think that Babylon 5 is a good science fiction television, it's not, it's a clich√© and not very inspiring). While American viewers like emotion and character development, science fiction is a genre that does. Do not take yourself seriously (see Star Trek). It can deal with important issues, but not as a serious philosophy. It's really hard to worry about the characters here, since they're not just dumb, they just miss a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to observe. The creators of the Earth KNOW that it is nonsense, since they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry Earth ..." otherwise, people would not keep looking. The ashes of Roddenberry must be spinning in its orbit while this boring, cheap, poorly edited (see it without advertising breaks really brings to this house) that transports Trabant from a show to space. Aileron Then, kill a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez Dallas again.
