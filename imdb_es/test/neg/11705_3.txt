I should not have seen the same movie that is mentioned here in the comments. First, I think they should have serialized Ghost Story if they were to film it. The truncated version they created was horrible. I felt that the performances were polite and that the story was left out in such a way that the performances of teachers like Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks seemed ridiculous. Alice Krige was excellent as Eva, however. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was only suitable as a protagonist. The decision to choose Patricia Neal and to truncate her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with that character! I blame the script, which was poor. The production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A pedestrian effort, disappointing. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five best suspense / horror novels of the twentieth century, PAHO. But the film was disappointing, although a great introduction for Krige.
