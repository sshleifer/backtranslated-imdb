Why did I have to go out and buy (yes, buy) JACK FROST 2: THE REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN? Maybe it was an explosion of temporary mental disorder? But I guess it's because I enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but fun horror comedy that had some good effects from Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was a nice picture of this type crossed by this giant icicle (which comes out of his mouth with a lot of blood and everything). So I thought: if he's as stupid as the first one and has a little splash, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead! <br /> <br /> First let me say that the film deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and insane plot. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that breeds snowballs from mutant killer babies that can only be killed or damaged by bananas. As much as I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (apparently filmed in a real movie and everything), this sequel has the appearance of a third-rate soap opera. In this way it looks too clever in video. The lighting is simply awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). Acting ... well, do not even go there. The dialogues range from rigid to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was simply a fool, saying "man" after each sentence). And when it comes to the murderous snowman's voice, all I could think about was a CHILD'S PLAY seventh-grade Chucky throwing up supposedly clever nonsense before he killed someone. <br /> <br /> The best joke a man asks "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was undoubtedly that of that beautiful Asian girl coming out of nowhere and swimming in the pool totally naked (thank God for that!). Oh yes, and that little scene about the final credits with those two Japanese guys on a miniature ship that are being dubbed, also made me laugh. But the worst of this movie was: Where was the bleeding and splashed action that everyone is talking about? There were many occasions to show some decent bloody murders. Many people were murdered in original ways here, but all off the screen. As I have read in many other comments, in fact, there was a good configuration of an explosion in the head, a crushed body, eyes poked out, tongue ripped out, ... but at crucial moments the editor cut the blood. Splashing on the floor or nothing at all. That front shot of that British guy who was being impaled (from the back cover of the DVD) was not even in the movie. I only saw that particular murder filmed from behind (which means I did not see sh! T!). I was waiting for the whole movie for that to happen, and then I can not see anything! What a disappointment! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? That would be a shame, because only a decent amount of splashed fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of murderous snowballs reduced to a bloody pulp just did not do it for me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were very badly made. They made MUNCHIES look like avant-garde 'animatronics'. But I guess that was the central point of this. At some point, the special effects team even resorted to a ridiculously bad CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. The best thing is not to see it, really, because this movie is too bad (well, I laughed with that, because it kept getting worse and worse). Just stay with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be fine (just keep in mind that it's a pretty silly horror comedy, but fun in itself). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but writer / Director Michael Cooney must have somehow realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2, and then he focused on writing. It turns out that he then wrote two rather good suspense scripts for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So man seems to have some talent after all. <br /> <br /> It would now be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible rating. So I say a point for that nude Asian babe doing a thin dive and a point for those babies with snowballs completely delayed. Very good Mr. Cooney!
