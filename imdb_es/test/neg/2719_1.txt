The radio is possibly one of the best movies I've seen and, at the same time, one of the worst. It made me laugh in the places where you were supposed to cry and it made me tremble in the moments when you were supposed to laugh. He lacked any kind of character development that is often crucial to a sentimental film that is. some questions, why did Harris's character take the radio under his wing? This was not explained properly, and I am sure that their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most useless if you have seen it. <br /> <br /> That he continues to work for Junior Gooding in Cuba, is a shitty actor and should be mocked until he takes another line of work. <br /> <br /> As the true stories say, this is not so interesting. The reason why I said it is one of the best movies I've seen, is because, despite being a complete publication, I still enjoyed it. laughing at the script, and most of the monologues that are truly anyone's job, I'm an idiot or someone very intelligent who tries to show how easy it is to throw a shitty movie about a retard that becomes everyone's favorite joke. The fact is that the character of Cuba is a comedy comedy for people who watch football matches.
