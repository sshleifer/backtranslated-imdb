I am new to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria are an indication, then Argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than of history. In their films, the characters are located in contexts of exhausting and fascinating horror that literally saturate the logic of the world that surrounds them. The camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run, stumble and choke on their way to a terrifying conclusion. It worked, REALLY good, in Suspiria. For some reason, it did not work here. <br /> <br /> The problem I see with this movie is that even though the protagonist "gets help" when contacting the police and asking his friends for help, he still feels as if he refused to "get help." "In terms of trying to find a solution to your problem. The trap in this movie is that it is trapped in the little game of the killer, one that could easily get rid of ... does not it install so easily? In a strange way, it seems that the character wants the torture that the murderer gives him, which in a way is the point and it could have worked, except that all his psychology is mainly due to everything Argento wants to do. <Br /> <br /> As a loving tribute to "The Phantom of the Opera", it is certainly an interesting and unique shot. For its value, Argento also delights with operatic movements, which highlights the action. It just does not make much sense, especially because it delves into a completely useless ending (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris' novel "Red Dragon." No, it did not work). Why the character should go from a horrible experience of entrapment to a volunteer with the director is beyond me. He felt almost self-sufficient on Argento's part. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a fun experience, and between this and Suspiria I am more than willing to continue in more Argento productions. But this is not a movie that I would like to return to or remember. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
