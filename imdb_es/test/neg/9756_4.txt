When I entered the movie with the right expectations, I somehow liked this movie. Like most of the critics who have seen this movie, I totally agree that the plot was very thin, clich√© and could predict every plot turn from the beginning of the movie. But, the dance sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical dance and hip-hop (which I enjoy watching). The music / soundtrack of the film was also very good, which made the "dramatic" scenes more bearable. The protagonists (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were good as actors, but their dance throughout the film was impressive and fascinating. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie that is worth seeing if you like to see good dance sequences. and this movie is MUCH MORE better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and drama. On the other hand, that does not say much, right? = P
