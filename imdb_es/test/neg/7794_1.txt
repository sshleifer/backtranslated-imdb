Do the writers who evoke this type of "comedies" have lives so empty that they have to embody them in tragic spectacles like this one? <br /> <br /> Why is the talented and magnificent Busy Phillips among this garbage beyond? I can not stand the Hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is as funny and annoying as the other African-American girl with a high-pitched voice. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often stupid, the Jewish man shouts a lot and the show never gets anywhere, a particular episode with the soldier looking for love was simply terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not think there are many working in a love office looking for one and only one man? Of course, all women are in tight tops and tons of makeup to make up for their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found Holly fun in her older shows and I've always admired Busy, but this show is silly, empty and had nothing in her favor.
