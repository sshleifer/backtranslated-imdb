Bulletproof is clearly a disposable film. The kind in which good guys and bad guys are attacked everywhere, so much so that you're not supposed to see them as humans. The yawns between the lines of Wayans and Sandler are really extensive. They try hard but, unfortunately, the person does not make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays an ingenious villain, but he has always had the advantage of being on the list. The scene of my favorite are the repeated clips of a television ad in which Caan reveals that the virtues of the United States can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Apart from that, it's a movie of friends with weapons for brains. Pass on this.
