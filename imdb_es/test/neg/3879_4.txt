Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time in a big way! I wonder if Govinda made this movie. Govinda ... friend ... I'm your big fan, do you have to make the right decisions now when choosing a movie? I wonder if he had any role in that movie. The role of Govinda could be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... doubt! You have created a space in the hearts of everyone around the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree ... you deserve something better. Paresh Rawal is good at his wit! In general, there were few scenes in which I laughed ... otherwise, I asked myself "what the hell did Priyadarshan do to make such a stupid movie?" Anyway, let's wait and see the next movie.
