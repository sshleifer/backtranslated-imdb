The Australian original Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do US producers need to remake and ruin another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece, and there was no need to remake it. The producers said that the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not translate to an American audience ......... WHAT? Basically, they are saying that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand jokes, so they need to remake shows with excessive childish jokes so that Americans can understand humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague!
