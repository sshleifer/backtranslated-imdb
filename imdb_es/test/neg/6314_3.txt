Spoilers abound. They have warned me. <br /> <br /> I was completely disappointed, this is my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've seen (I do not dare approach the 1994 joke). Very little is striking you in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) unlike most users of Japanimation. The fights are performed hilariously on board (Shun against Zangief was a laugh) and the dramatization is too capricious, especially towards the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> Main Street The wrestler, Ryu, has been weakening to a much darker version within himself. The frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A grim street fight tournament is held with something more than just fighting in the mind of the promoter. <br /> <br /> What about the artist's foot drawing? Any anime drawn on the stomach is impressive. The mild nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too smart, and puts much more emphasis on a character (Shun), who is not even a fighter in the game! A study of characters in more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Boy? A STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.
