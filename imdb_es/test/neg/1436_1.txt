Sometimes I wonder if today's horror films depend on human torture to scare people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror films. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified, this movie does exactly this, but not in a good way. Now there are some moments in the movie where there is a possibility that Snyder is preventing this movie from falling into a hole, but let's be honest, this movie did not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder does not do anything. try anything to get out of it. When you finish watching this movie, you feel sick, depressed, dirty and crazy. I have the feeling that that was the intention of this movie. What is lower than dirt?
