If the rich are different from us because they have more money, then the filmmakers are different from us because they think that the world cares about each of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> This self-indulgent piece of gut seems to have been made only because the director felt it was time to make another movie, and someone would finance it. Not all trivial ideas or reflections are worthy of a movie (unless you're a college student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, sometimes it is better to remain silent. <br /> <br /> The images are not impressive. They are pretty ordinary. The dialogue is inane and incredible. They speak words that no one would do each sequence in situations that are beyond imagination. Germaine Greer zipless f ** k finally arrives on the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one goes to bed as easily as these characters. They are screwed before speaking. Even more incredible is an aged and bald director who finds instant sex with the most beautiful girl in the city, although gravity is already reaching Miss Marceau at a young age.
