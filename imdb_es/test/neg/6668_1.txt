I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the other breath gasp breathlessly. My unknown parents took me to see this movie when I was a child, expecting a funny and normal Norman Wisdom comedy. Instead, what you get is this insipid British sexual comedy of the worst kind in which Norman (Norman!) Plays a swinger with the goal of dating as many "birds" as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre: bad filmed and acted, without an appearance of a script beyond the worst sense, and vague indications of "evil". And all apparently in that special grainy film reserved for the low budget British films of the sixties and seventies. The only memorable thing is the melody of annoying and catchy theme, which still appears in my brain after 30 years. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the last scene you can also see Norman naked, running through the Arena and looking frozen. I think anyway, at that moment my mother took me out of the cinema. Many years later I saw him again, and guess what, it was still terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fanatic or you are interested in the little man and his career, you will apply the '10 foot-bargepole' rule for this. Believe me, you do not need to see Norman Wisdom's ass.
