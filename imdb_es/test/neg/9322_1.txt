Do not get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's films, so it was with great emotion that I was able to attend the screening of "Rolling Thunder" in the French cinematic of Paris with a surprise movie on December 17, 2004. Of course, the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most of the people were there for that (I was too). The film was finished but the score, so P Schrader used extracts from The Return of the King and some other film that I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyway, apart from that, the movie was finished. The happy few (perhaps 200 people) were asked not to write about the film on the Internet or in magazines, as it may have jeopardized their chances of being selected for the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then realized that the film could not be selected for the Festival because of its quality: never in my life had experienced such an uncomfortable feeling in the audience when people went from being skeptical to simply laughing out loud . in the show full of grief. I could not believe how low the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk. <br /> <br /> Forced above the top, stupid end, black and white moral, terrible effects, The worst take on the part of Schrader's Christianity, not even suspense, just boring as hell (no word game) and nothing surprising! Some good places but unfortunately badly used or at least do not meet the initial hopes! In the end, I was 100 times more satisfied with Schrader's Rolling Thunder and wanted my 2 hours back. <br /> <br /> Do not believe in the hype, even John Boorman's movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and at Billy Crawford's casting, the poor guy does the best he can, but what do you expect? Now it is part of the small club of worst launching errors! I give the movie a 1/5 just because I did not leave the room, but I should have.
