(This is a review of Disney's latest English release, with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and company). <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the enthusiastic reviews of this previous Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see her. But I was surprised, I was surprised by the quality of this movie. Those subsequent films have well-crafted arguments, three-dimensional characters and the best film music since ... well ... always. This movie just does not come close. <br /> <br /> However, I could also start with the positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki's films, this one is still very imaginative, with a strange fantasy / science fiction scenario, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast an animation far superior to other films of his time. (although it is not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the interpretation in English is very well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... simply ... is not ... good ... All the characters are cardboard, from the sweet sucrose Nausicaa, to the ruthless Tolmekians, to all the others. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen everything there is. And the fact that the plot simply wanders does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music ... Now, Hisaichi is indisputably my favorite movie composer, but Nausicaa does not do it justice. Half of the music is the keyboards of the 80s in overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the images instead of helping them. I suspect that Hisaichi was asked to compose a lot of music before he saw the image. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message with this movie, right? Let's save the environment! Too bad this movie hits you in the head with it like a hammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. Not really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It saddens me a bit to talk about how scarce this movie is. But for some reason, all the other criticisms in IMDb seem to adore it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in long sentences to tell you what's going on, that's silly. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who loves anime, enjoy the music of the 80s and plant a tree every day of Arbor, you probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for your subsequent films, because they are great.
