One would think that a movie starring three of the greatest male stars of the post-World War II era would have become a classic. These three who are also three of my favorites, walk in a daze, looking like they would rather be anywhere, but there. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that The Way West definitely had something Potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, something that is not done now is a film about the American pioneers and the tribulations of their migration to the west. It should have been done better back then. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former senator from the United States who heads west in a wagon to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Being that he is an ex-politician, he qualifies above the hoi ploi he is leading. The script asks him not only to have a covered car, but also a carriage to direct the train. <br /> <br /> You think that's ridiculous, you should see the scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I will not spoil it by saying what makes Douglas demand this from Glenn, but trust me, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the trail guide and, of the three stars, it seems the most boring. There was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just hung around the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe the friction helped a bit because the movie asks Douglas, a widower, to keep an eye on Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she is the best seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> The billing of the film says that we present Sally Field. This was done between her Gidget and her days as a flying nun. She plays a piece of white trash from the south with the name of the musical comedy of Mercy McBee. We see her for the first time in the movie, sitting in the back of her parents' car, with her akimbo and inviting legs. Of course, she is accepted by your invitation. <br /> <br /> Your character is something like what you find in every caravan park in the United States and then again what was a train of wagons, but a large trailer park in motion. <br /> <br /> Despite this movie, Sally Field went on to a two-Oscar career. What that woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Andrew, the son of Victor McLaglen, directed this article and, together with a bad writing, turned it into a turgid mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he has certainly done better in his career. <br /> <br /> And you too, unless you're a star hunter.
