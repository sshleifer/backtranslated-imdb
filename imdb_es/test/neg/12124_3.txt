I have to say that this is better than most SyFy exits, but it does not say much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch of the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game , only to be interrupted halfway when the friend who left the beer race dies in a way that the game predicted. <br /> <Br /> What follows is a series of deaths that are typical of a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. He has the puzzle at the end and the interesting secondary plot with the policeman who wants the game to bring his family ... but, otherwise, it's just a disaster.
