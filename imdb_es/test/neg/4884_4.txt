It was very interesting to find another critic who had exactly the same reaction to this film as me: it was much better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Looking at it for more than 30 years later, it's still fine, but it just kept my interest a little bit. What seemed enormously funny back then was only mildly funny. <br /> <br /> Also, the things that amazed me when a 10-year-old child seemed silly to me. For example, in one scene, Trinity walks and shoots his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking. In fact, he does not even bother to look and see if they are dead, because he knows he reached the mark. Um, yes, to the right. <br /> <br /> In addition, much of the dialogue sounds quite wooden. I'm sorry, but 35 years later, it really has not aged so well. <br /> <br /> Although it has been a long time since I saw that one too, it's probably a better Terrence Hill movie than this one. be my name is nobody
