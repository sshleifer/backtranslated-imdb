I do not care if this program is supposed to be transmitting profound messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The program is crap ... how can someone enjoy watching it? However, he was received so well. This reflects a sad state of affairs for Joe Moron. <br /> <br /> I tried to see this program when it first came out when friends talked about it. The inane laughter between the two main characters and the lamentable dialogue made me want to cry. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people can see this show. However, I think the creators had the last laugh ... getting rich by taking the pss out of the same people who would see a show like this. <br /> <br /> I'd bet they're laughing all the way to the bank
