Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it is coming right after the fans of Conan O'Brien and Late Night are suddenly watching the Carson show. Carson Daly can not offer a candle to Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other evening talk show host, and Last Call seems to lose more than success in this hit and weird genre. The show that only redeems quality is that it is so short. But, I would not call it garbage. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his program is not great (that honesty is really useful here), while some of the skits and material of Last Call seem to have been stolen, sometimes they still find the brand. Actually, some of Carson's productions have been quite entertaining, and the dramas occasionally have their decent comedy moments. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson is fine, even with just one guest, it's not exactly the nightly material, but still above the level reached by a high school AV team. However, he does not have the quick wit that makes Conan so hilarious. I do not like your musical guests, but that's more because I'm not a fan of that kind of music, so I'm not defending it. <br /> <br /> To the house band. I do not know Joe Firstmans' band and I would not compare them to the CBS Orchestra, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetons are better. But, the bandmates of Firstmans still do the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Sax player who sometimes appears (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the top register), if there is anything, watch the show for him, I do it. <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is not even worth a bag full of kibble n 'bits. But it has an audience, and it attracts more to the younger "mtv generation". If it has no cable and it gets up at 1:37 a.m., there really is not much more to choose from and, surprise, there is something worse in that period of time. So, if you're waiting for Poker After Dark to appear, 30 minutes of Last Call will not kill you during the wait.
