I'm just launching this review to prove that I'm not crazy. I really like Wynorski's work. Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are fast and very nice, just to show that I'm not blind, I have to mention this, along with some of Shannon Tweed's "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something like that", they are the lousiest . I have nothing against prolonged sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural. When looking, you can not avoid looking at them, which may be the desired effect, but I did not enjoy looking at them, and several members of this cast seem to be depressed or disinterested. The "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to happen to the low budget films, and thank God that his day has ended more or less.
