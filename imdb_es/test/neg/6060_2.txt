I thought there might be some level of value for this movie, and I sat through the whole thing. I can summarize by saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie started well, I think the initial characterization of Herc was true to the myths. As much as a child as a young adult started very strong, but not the brightest bulb. But later he becomes in some way a charismatic speaker loved by all. Eh <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satyr looked good, but the rest of the bugs just looked terrible, especially the deer, the most cunning beast in the movie. And how is it that Leelee Sobieski's skin was sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me, and everyone should be ashamed of this, were the twelve labors of Hercules. Because the producers obviously did not want to cover them all; Maybe they thought that we, the primed threaded who saw this garbage, could not count so high. In place of the TWELVE works of Hercules, we obtained the FIVE works of Hercules. Yes, the five jobs! WTF?!? He did not even finish the last one, so it really was the 4 1/2 jobs! Simply terrible I'll take Hercules: The legendary journeys on this piece of garbage any day of the week.
