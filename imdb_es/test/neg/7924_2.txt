This movie is ... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has great nostalgic value for me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (plays Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest), who have great filmographies, and these are the only performances that are fine. The rest of the performance and the film itself have all the qualities of the B movie that some of us appreciate. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it's almost nonexistent. . I guess it was suspended shortly after its release. But eventually I found a copy and paid a penny to acquire it. If you come across Doomsday in a video store (unmistakable with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still have a working copy. . A must for those of you who like to laugh at the cheesy attempts to see a horror movie.
