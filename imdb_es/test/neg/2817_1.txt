Killing the screaming queen may sound like a good slasher movie, but it's terribly boring and very silly. <br /> <br /> Killing the screaming queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions the girls to be in his snuff film. He rapes them and tortures them. This is junk that is not fun, entertaining or entertaining. The murderer has no reason, it's okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they could have given a victim their own story. Anything could be an improvement. I needed a lot more. <br /> <br /> They could put a little more into that. I love horror / slasher movies but this is ridiculously bad.
