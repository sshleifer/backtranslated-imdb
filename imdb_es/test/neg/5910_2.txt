I did not expect much with HARLEM NIGHTS but I did not expect it to be as bad as it was. Undoubtedly, the worst aspect is the obscene language, it really is horrible the amount that is in this movie and before someone accuses me of being a weak let me point out two things ... <br /> <br /> 1) Among my favorite movies I would include GOODFELLAHS, PLATOON, RAGING BULL while my favorite movie of all time is APOCALYPSE NOW <br /> <br /> 2) My favorite American television show of all time is the drama of the HBO prison OZ <br /> <br /> so you watch movies and TV shows with large amounts of oaths, it does not usually bother me, but the problem I had with HARLEM NIGHTS has to do with the fact that it's supposed to be It is a comedy, but it seems that the production team arrived. to the conclusion that an audience laughs every time someone (especially if that person is black) says a rude word and decided to substitute funny situations with swearing throughout the film in the hope of getting a laugh. Well, I thought I would never start laughing and I did not.
