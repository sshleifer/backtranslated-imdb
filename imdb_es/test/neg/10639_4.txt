This fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical premiere, although it feels like a direct to the video film. It's fine, I suppose, but nothing special. The performance is the worst seen in the series until this moment. and as in the third movie, there is not much in the sense of the imagination. Also, the phrase "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Smith is the pseudonym that directors use when they do not want to have anything to do with the film. Anyway, it's an acceptable movie in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than that. It is a slight drop in the quality of number three, and a large drop in the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is a 4.5 / 10
