I guess I got ready after all the years of listening to him. I first heard from Siskel and Ebert. When they said that Divine ate the excrement, I had to look for it. Then, a friend told me about it in 1991. She also said that her parents saw him when he first went out and that his mother almost left him for his father. So by the time I caught Pink Flamingos at Sundance today, I was ready. For the most part. <br /> <br /> I still could not help but be surprised by the anal close-ups and the blowjob scene. That said, the only characters he liked were Edie and the egg man. His crying scene at the beginning of the film, although somewhat frivolous for normal people, actually makes me sad. Although I'm sure she was not pretty, she had a nice voice. I felt happy for her and for the egg man, and they actually touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performance in this production at the poverty level was not good. And as for the script, how does this come to John Waters? Well, at least it's different.
