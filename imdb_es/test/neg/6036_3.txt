The White Warrior is definitely one of the weakest movies, if not Steve Reeves. Set in eighteenth or nineteenth-century Russia (??) Steve plays a Cossack warrior trying to overtake a crazed Russian czar running down the side of a mountain with his rebel band in a ridiculous looking Russian white robe ... For the most part of Reeves' great body he is hiding in a ridiculous robe to the knee, with an even more foolish Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is quite minimal, with only a good fight scene from the middle of the waist to the top that shows the great physicist Reeves. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to remove Reeves from the genre of swords and sandals to another historical era, with poor results. The dialogue from the script is difficult to understand at various points, and only the narrator's comments allow the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I imagine that Reeves regretted having made this film, but in an attempt to remove his toga, sandals and tribune armor, he threw it to other historical figures such as Morgan the pirate and the thief of Baghdad.
