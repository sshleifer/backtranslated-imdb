This is a great movie for ninjas for the first time that they are dating. If you're trying to impress a cute little ninjette, I recommend you play this masterpiece. It is one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> I was also wondering, where is a Teal ninja hiding? Are ninjas color coded in this way? This is normal? If one of these yellow or orange ninjas attacked me, I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my ninja black star test the other day, it was multiple choice, it was pretty good. I discovered there were many questions about how to "sneak out" and look evil. It's about eyebrows and attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could be combined in a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to take revenge. 3. Several monkeys scattered throughout the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced by another character 6. The Frenchman was also a black star ninja 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as "comic" relief 8. The ninja strongholds came from miticlorianos.
