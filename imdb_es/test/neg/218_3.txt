Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters, incredible and throughout the film, let me feel bored and dissatisfied. There was not a real plot that could make you keep spinning around the movie and keep you interested. The robbery itself never offered any emotion and did not seem very good. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background for any character and the character of Laurance Fishbourne was one I was waiting impatiently, unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play brut thuggish and is very much preferred as a nice character . Columbus, one of my favorite actors (in stomp the yard) disappointed me with his performance, his character was dark and you could hardly see what motivated his reasoning. <br /> <br /> The only character that I offered him something. The film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is quite small and insignificant, I think his touch was added to a boring movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
