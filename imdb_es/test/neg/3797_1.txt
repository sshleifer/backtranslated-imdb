4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great actors of the character Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour and 54 minutes of pure tedium, melodrama and horrible performance, a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT DID YOU THINK? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen was just trying to capitalize on the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a D-less script, the actors were obviously also in the same payment , ... the horror, the horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are the characters that Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field are playing? Enter a potentially deadly ship that is sinking 1. in flames 2. hot by steam 3. slippery by water and oil, 4. boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., all for the love of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less a grappling hook, a rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What were they? They are thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle exaggerates so much that he just wanted to slap him! For! And what is the deal with the bad toupee? Also, there's no way you can believe that your character was a World War II veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all that gold and money and they are happy, wow! They were rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yee haw, it's the great actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors in abundance! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight, too! <br /> <br /> The final dramatic sub-plot about that terrifying plutonium was never really anywhere, it's as if they had forgotten it, or something like that? Many holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This movie has a disease that the strongest pill could not cure. I'm surprised that Alan J. Smithee's name did not appear in the script. I would be ashamed to have written this one! <br /> <br /> Oh, the madness, Oh, humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> The Horror, The Horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made with recycled material. material of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The script had to be in the compost heap ...
