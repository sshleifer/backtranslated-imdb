I was surprised to discover that Michael Moore or Bill Maher were not involved in this "movie". A US leftist list of axes to grind, with a clear dispersion of democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room as Hitler? We may have to wait for these doctors in California to kill Paradiso to show all their political figures as favorite ideologues. <br /> <br /> Cheap shots to religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists. Fox News, even SUVs. All the radical points of leftist discussion were too completely covered, while they omitted notoriously the references to the crimes committed from the "other side of the aisle", without having been a conscious effort. The only exception I noticed, in the hour and a half, is that JFK has to have sex with Marilyn Monroe for all eternity: the inclusion of tokens in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt to appear non-partisan.
