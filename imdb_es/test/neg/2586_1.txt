Last night I watched this movie and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as horrible as I did. <br /> <br /> Of course, obviously some people see a lot in this movie that I did not see, so if you're one of those people, well, good luck to you. But I am a patient person. I have enjoyed extremely long movies before. But this was an exercise in torture for me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I felt that this was one of those movies with little to say, and that it was more about style than substance, however, style too. It made me want to tear my hair. Almost everything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off the screen. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a film completely from shots: the bits that are normally reserved for the section of scenes deleted from a DVD, if they were shown to the general public. <br /> <br /> You do not 'I can not even discover, in the end, SOMETHING about the main character, Francois. I did not sympathize with any of the characters in this movie, except perhaps with the violinist and his goat, and the old man who believes that octopi live up to 300 because they are really intelligent. Seriously, I was thrilled when he cut off a shot from Francois holding a gun to his head. I felt so cheated when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be very boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? Do you smoke opium, too? I swear, I almost screamed every time I was subjected to a prolonged shot that nothing was happening, except maybe someone walking from one place to another, and finally, FINALLY there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene, and it would be a year later, and we missed EVERYTHING INTERESTING THAT HAPPENED AT THE MOMENT, and everyone was still wearing the same blood clothes ... I liked it - great But this review is intended as an antidote to the monster "you will love this movie if you like it cinema". Scum I've seen published here and elsewhere. (See, I hated the movie and I STILL included a wink reference to its content!)
