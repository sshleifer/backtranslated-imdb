The abysmal Indonesian action film of the legendary Arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for the future role of Cinemax as 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while at the same time burying the poor star of the action Pat O 'Brien with a three-dimensional script and three cans of gel to comb the hair to make her impressive mullet from 1984. The physical prowess of this type resembles that of one more woman, Mark Gregory, and her next credit would be a secondary role for Chris Mitchum as "Tom Selick." Powerful. At least, the action is unreflective and uninterrupted, with some daring Asian specialists who risk their lives for what is essentially a film poorly constructed by adolescents and / or addicted to methods without a concept of reality. A poor extra is destroyed by an electric hedge trimmer and many more die when hit in the head by strange objects, such as a motorcycle wheel or a cardboard box. The classic rape scenes are insipid and priceless, and you can cite a dialogue like "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" they are delivered with such exuberance and fervor by third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: a crazy crazy man who eats live lizards. The movie also holds the record for most cars driven through the walls. 2/10
