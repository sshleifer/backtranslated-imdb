I feel more foolish after seeing the first 20 minutes. Fortunately, I went out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better movies and take notes about why they are rated high, not because of the movie's budget or special effects. just act well and do simple things well, and MOST important - not be LAME - but I guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and without a hint of what is '' A good movie '' will not be if he is afraid to have a low rating of movies, save your lowest and least appreciated scores for "movies once in a lifetime". Keep in mind that many use IMDb for reliable comments and opinions, do not spoil the broth with sugars and zesty Peace & love
