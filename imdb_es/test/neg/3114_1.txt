A ridiculous film, a terrible editing job, the worst script, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely incomprehensible ... <br /> <br /> If God was going to decide if the movies would continue to be made, judging by this, the whole world film industry would be dead now ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie to show that movies should not be made by people who "think" they can make movies. <br /> <br /> I still wonder who are these two gypsies who appear in the film for more than half an hour and are never presented to us ... <br /> <br />
