Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate plan to hijack a casino, wing "Ocean's 11", and put it in the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels and the number 69 And with the true Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly docile. The Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie focused on them. It is not snoorefest. Luckily, this is one of the DVDs that includes comments from Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain of having to read them is greatly relieved. If you see it differently, let me recommend something to you. DO NOT !! <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD extras: comment from Joe Bob Brigg; The message of Conny Van Dyke to his fans (does he have more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
