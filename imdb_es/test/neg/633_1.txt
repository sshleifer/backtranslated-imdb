We all know that special effects cost money, but it seems that they could have used the money they saved by writing the script to get better shots. The train is obviously a model on most of the moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the end of Spaceballs, except it's a decade later and Spaceballs had an excuse. <br /> <br /> The smartest thing they did was to blur all the special effects to make them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Even the actors could not compensate for such a badly written script and it is quite obvious that they did not try either. . <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time. Please.
