Obviously influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", he does not get the problem. Limited special effects, a thin story line results in a production that even the average decent cast can not save. There is simply no credibility here. No one seems surprised to find Martians, like Earthlings, etc. Pass it on!
