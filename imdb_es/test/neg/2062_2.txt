I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". It is not a classic, and since the plot was updated at the time of its release, it is not historical either. The real title on the DVD is "Indecent" and, furthermore, subtitled "Becky Sharp's private life". Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she has a horrible script and a well-worn dialogue. As with many of the early fans, and especially those made by smaller studios, there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew. Loy wears some dresses that are quite elegant, but her costumes and makeup in later scenes are exaggerated. The only one who saves is a tolerable performance by Billy Bevan, who plays one of his many suitors.
