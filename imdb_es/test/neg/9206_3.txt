After the success of Star Wars, there was an increase in interest in science fiction movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to charge quickly. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors of a spaceship landed on a planet inhabited by dinosaurs in motion, where half of them are systematically killed (people do not The dinosaurs). Performance at the level of porn movie. Cheap special effects, even for the moment, although it seems that they have put a lot of effort. <br /> <br /> The costumes were from the 70's pure, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70s. I was hoping a disco would break at any moment. <br /> <br /> Nothing to really recommend in this movie.
