I'm also a fan of House Party ... House Party I is my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is an embarrassment to all HP and Kid n Play ... This was supposed to be part of a series really ... there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans .. Yes, Kid n Play is probably too old to release a House Party movie b / c that focuses on teenagers ... but Kid N Play could have made at least one cameo ... you can see how good it was b / c It did not even reach the cinemas. Immature was in House Party 3, so it made sense for them to continue with the legacy ... but they should have represented the right ... they should have left it in House Party 3. I'm 27 years old and I've been watching House Party I ever since I was 11 years old when it was published in 1990 (16 years ago) and I've been a fan ever since. When I saw House Party 4 for the first time, I thought about what they were really thinking ... There was nothing familiar in this movie that compared to the 3 previous films ... I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller on the days off.
