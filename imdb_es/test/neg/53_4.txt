I do not understand The teen protagonists of "Horror Star" are supposed to be fans of horror, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) dies, they dig up his body and do all sorts of disrespectful things to him, like dancing in a club in the house. and throw the leftovers of food to her. That does not sound like something that real terror fans would do, right? I am a big fan of terror and I become a huge idol of deceased icons such as Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it never occurred to me to ridicule his memory. No wonder that Conrad returns from death. Is it true, after a session? To erase everyone from the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was no longer known for his kindness in life, as he occasionally killed directors who did not agree with his visions, and even after his death, suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his grave there are video messages to petrify potential visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the business of murder outside of his film sets. "Horror Star" (a.k.a. "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a rather boring horror movie from the 80s, but there are a handful of outstanding cheesy and gory to enjoy. The movie suffers mainly from its own stupid plot, since nobody? Not even a student of film school? he's stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and really think he'll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to fight. Conrad's video speeches from beyond the grave are too talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his methods of killing are pleasantly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of being cremated alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) He loses his head in a lovely decapitation sequence. In the most disorderly sequence absolute, the head of a poor girl is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to classic horror films and, obviously, how to make cinema seem sinister. The locations and the stage are excellent, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with adequate continuity and editing work. Acting performances are generally decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs playing the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be considered a must-see or even a good movie, but it's worth tracing in case you're a B-horror fan made with enthusiasm.
