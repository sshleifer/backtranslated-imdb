We all know that the world is full of false and distorted horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch, because of their stupidity, their terrible effects and the dubious dialogue. But Raptor, who could have been in the same league as the equally useless Carnosaur series, does not even TRY to have any pleasure in it. It's so badly done, it's really unbearable, even if you look at it with the intention of having a brainless day at home. Where do we start? Well ... the sets are pretty monotonous. My old drama group created more realistic scenarios. The genetics labs seem to be from a university, and it looks equally amazing on the outside (even to cover up, why do you stand near the civilization where people can easily hear the roars of dinosaurs), while doctors do not they do it? You look believable at all. Next on the list of complaints are the effects of the creatures; Well, what can I say? Absolutely regrettable Also, I think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. The two main female characters have had such obvious jobs, and knocks them down, since one woman is a respected member of the police, while the other is the sweet and "innocent" daughter of the city sheriff. Acting, however, is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for at least trying to give something to his role. That is where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer for making his mediocre performance look even more pathetic, while the female lead looks so bored (although, with this movie, you can let her go). The other character that I will point out is the daughter, who allows her tits to act in the "lascivious" sex scene (Ten minutes of endless shots of rebounding her bounce on a guy). <br /> <br /> In general, and summarized as one. do not bother, just do not do it
