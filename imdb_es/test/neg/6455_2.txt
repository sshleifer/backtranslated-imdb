Yes, this revision may contain spoilers, but you will thank me. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I came to this forum hoping to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this movie and Spacey's performance in particular. <br /> <br /> Some will reprimand me for saying it, but I think Kevin Spacey is acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a bad version of Kevin's "American Beauty" role. His character in this movie is exaggeratedly ridiculed, even the insults he makes to his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are boring and boring scenes from around the world, like when Spacey is tearing Whaley apart to bring him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected that this particular scene should be fun, but by then I was ready to press the stop button (this is about 20 minutes inside the movie). <br /> <br /> What about the faux-tribute? to "reserve dogs"? Whaley proclaims: "I think I saw this in a movie once," as if it were going to cut off Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut it? A wrap! That's right, he's going to give you paper cutouts! That has to be one of the worst scenes of all time in Hollywood, and the fact that the actors and the director tried to carry it out with a serious face makes it even more frightening. <br /> <br /> I admit that I did not. I do not see the end of this movie (my DVD was kept mercifully half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say it could avoid the line that I had missed a big turn and that everything would make sense. Well, I do not care what happened at the end, because I could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly exaggerated dialogue. I even had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as badly as I did.
