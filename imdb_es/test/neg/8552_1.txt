Sad, very sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, well, maybe Sybil Danning) to keep you watching. It also hurt to see Linda Blair in this exploitation film. She certainly deserves something better. <br /> <br /> So, what is the story about? Let's see ... Warden John Vernon records the inmates in quite inspiring positions, while prisoner Sybil actually runs in prison and little Linda must fight to survive ... It looks like a B movie, huh? Is.
