The future of fantasy never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert confronts the evil demon Grendel in this dreadful fantasy game of poor quality. "Epos" I said? Hey ... there's only one place, so you really can not call it an epic adventure, right? The location is a 5-inch-tall medieval / futuristic castle, so how did they manage to cram all the actors? Oh, I understand, those are the special effects. A miniature. Stupid of me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why you might want or NOT want to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert is back to doing his tricks with the sword as he did in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and the costumes are incredibly great (if you are a 12 year old boy). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a pair of voluptuous ailerons that she likes to brag about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> - ... er, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - every time they start fighting, this The techno rave soundtrack gets going . So, why do these types of medieval killers fight while they should be dancing? <br /> <br /> - They do not have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed that seem to work well. So, where is the amplifier? I guess they borrowed it from the techno-dj that delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Watch it for the climax at the end, which features an extravagant CGI demono√Ød creature that comes straight out of any Playstation 2 horror-survival game. <br /> <br /> If all this interested you, go see it (at your own risk), but do not tell anyone that I told you. I strongly suspect that Pinhead visits the set while filming, because this movie has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin, then look at HOLLOW MAN, by Paul Verhoeven.
