Greetings to all, <br /> <br /> Is not it amazing the power that movies have over you after the first viewing? <br /> <br /> I was so delighted with the first viewing of this movie, I could not stop talking about "Flatliners" with all my friends for weeks. Keep in mind that I was an 18-year-old very impressionable at the time and my liking for movies has become a bit more conservative since then. <br /> <br /> Then somehow I forgot about this movie until I saw the DVD in my local store and remembering how great it was, I thought "Right! I will tear you off the shelf when you take out the Special Edition". <br /> <br /> Last week, I was filled with joy when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this movie even more in the second visualization ... How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Verdict: after 11 years, my opinion about this film had changed from a very scary first class movie to total trash that exaggerates in the religious and supernatural aspect of things rather superficially. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts' acting (except for Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem With this film definitely falls to the director and such a mediocre script. I left this movie with the feeling that it had no real substance or potential, and only a couple of thrilling emotions that were not very well made. Not even James-Newtown Howard's score, whom I prefer as a film composer, could captivate and excite me. <br /> <br /> In 1990 I would have given this movie to 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be lucky enough to give him 2/10 at the most. <br /> <br />
