Hilariously inept, like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon", remade by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead: despite its title and the high number of people, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun. battles instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a B movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the Cinecolor process of short duration, which caused the faces to change their tone in the same shot. But there was definitely some false scrimp in the main set of the movie, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Bare Necessities" for Disney "The Jungle Book", provides a score full of original ditties that would have been wonderful for a cartoon, but that fit Western action like a diffuse shoe stuck in a stirrup. A song tells how "the hooves of the horses hit, and their melody sounds, like the serenade of helmets" ... during a scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate filmed history, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures, as they occur on the screen, and even stop to announce the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br /> The script sends fierce Navajo. The way of war to avenge the murder of two of his bands by an outlaw trio. At the end of the film, what seem like a hundred Navajos and cavalry men have bitten the dust (thanks to the repeated images of the same characters who die again and again). But the boss is satisfied once he sees that the trio of bad guys has been killed. While the singer informs us that we do not pay attention, the Navajos leave and their battle ends. The cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerfully expresses his appreciation. <br /> <br /> The address could be described charitably as wood, or more specifically, Wood-en. The Navajos are constantly expelled from their horses in pairs, never just one. Virtually all red men on foot die by throwing their hands in the air and kneeling. The film also employs the most cautious Hollywood specialists, who crouch before dropping a one-story roof (and still can not stay on the landing) or turn to look back as they slide, "dead", for a rocky slope. br /> <br /> The protagonist is Brian Donlevy, who surely deserves an Oscar for not blushing. After the final endless battle scene, "climax" is hardly the word, he scans a list of the dozens of his slain soldiers and shrugs, "It could have been much worse." Private Andy Devine sings and thief / murderer Gig Young laughs at Andy's pranks ... he leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to unleash Gig: "I'd know it anywhere!" <br /> <br /> And so that no one forgets what could be an unpleasant job for Howard Hughes, remember that as the head of RKO, Hughes was first on the blacklist of the original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC I report. It would take another six years for Hughes to finish running that once-famous studio, but it did not help when he insisted on rescuing every Da Silva scene for this movie, replacing Donlevy. <br /> <br /> It was almost a decade before Da Silva could return to work in Hollywood. But considering all things, to get him out of Slaughter Trail, he should have sent Hughes a thank-you note.
