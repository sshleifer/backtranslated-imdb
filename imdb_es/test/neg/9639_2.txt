It is unfortunate that between this film, In the Valley of Ela, Lions for Lambs and Home of the Braves, all are based on common stereotypes about the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The boozing, the combats, the short fuses, the broken marriages, the boys who go crazy and dig a hole in their front yard when they are drunk, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Does it happen? Yes, but not as often as one might think after having seen any of these movies. I think it's unfortunate that these directors / producers / writers choose to reject their ax against the political establishment by portraying the soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce did not even throw us a bone, like showing the new children who were born while a family member was deployed, or the boy who grew up in a ghetto who can now pay for college thanks to the GI Bill , or the couple that can pay for a house, or start a new business, obtain their citizenship, etc. etc. Instead, stereotypes are treated because the people who made this movie just want to show him the negative side. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems with the film itself: 1) someone made a mistake by putting Phillippe on a Bronze Star with V after he led his squad through a narrow alley after been attacked by an armed man in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The humvees did not have any tower armor, so we are supposed to believe that it is almost the beginning of the war, however, all the soldiers and their brothers have an ACOG and all the possible accessories for their M4. I'm sorry, I do not think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as Lieutenant Colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just verified that he turned 40 in May, so the time is not too bad. 4) Beat two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying he would not return to Iraq (upon learning that he had been arrested). So he is a fugitive. Then, when it is finally delivered at the end, and they recover it, does it maintain its rank and deploy with the same unit? I'm sorry, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as a giant stereotype of the Army and the Infantry. Some of the events described in this film happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this movie you get practically all the stereotypes in the space of about 100 minutes, and in reality things are not like that for most returning soldiers. I wish the director would have done a little more research instead of starting with her agenda and then making a movie. <br /> <br /> Of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is likely to be Lions for Lambs, which is more a comment on the sad state of Generation Y + than on the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush Administration. If you really want to watch this movie, wait for the cable or Netflix, do not pay in cash directly to rent it.
