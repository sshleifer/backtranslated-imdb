There are only 2 reasons why I watch this show ... I invested the time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all the supposed science fiction fans who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some of the classic sci-fi novels of the real greats or watch some of the most important movies and television shows of yesteryear and see what hacks these BSG writers are. His only trick is "who is the fifth cylon". Bad writing and really, really has no sense of character development. If Adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father, it should have been once again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is such an annoying character that he has once been put on a starship. Out of the airbag with her. I could care less if it's six more months before they end. These aspiring writers ran out of gimmicks in the first season. If you do not know, you just do not know how to write.
