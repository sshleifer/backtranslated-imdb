As the horror movies say, "Rest Stop" could have been better on many levels. The director / writer John Shiban shows that he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, I was not sure what to do with the material, or maybe, I was under pressure to deliver a different movie than I intended, either by the studio or by the sponsors. Several endings were included in the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psychopath traveling along the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first. After Jess's disappearance at the spooky rest stop, things get out of control. Poor Nicole is left alone to defend herself from all the odd bugs she meets on the way. <br /> <br /> It was clear when one began to hear "Amazing Grace" in the background that there were forces trying to take revenge on the roads. in which Nicole and Jess desecrate their neck of the forest practicing careless sex that the natives do not appreciate well. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. There is a lot of gore for fans of the genre.
