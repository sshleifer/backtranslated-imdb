As with many sequels, it does not have the quality or impact of the original. The first belongs to the rest of the greats. This simply does not cut it. The first film had a magical "good time" feeling that is totally absent in this movie. We fell in love with all these characters (except Richard Dreyfuss) in an era of innocence. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are very different people. While this is what happens in real life, we do not expect this to happen with our favorite movie characters! The film does not have the humor that the original had, and we expected to laugh. The little humor there is dark. The first film also presented what is probably the best soundtrack in history, while this one is good, but it does not even look like the original. This movie is so different from the original that it is not even a sequel. I gave him a 4.
