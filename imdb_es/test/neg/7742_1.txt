Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy and funny way, either. Even MST3K could not prevent it from being boring, and it is also confusing when everyone leaves. But the most annoying part of this dullness is the horrible high-pitched voice of Ireland, which was tired of listening in the first five minutes. Not to mention how really disgusting his character is. Even her dad ran away and abandoned her! I can see why, frankly. If he had had to listen to his moan in his little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do him great harm. As I was, at the end of the movie. In addition, it is useless and annoying. When she fell down the long hole in the ground like Alice in Wonderland, it would have been over in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably accented Australian miner had not continued to save her from the various situations in which she continued to fall. . He should have linked her to the Atlantean version of the train tracks and finished it. And this subterranean Atlantis with the strange and confused obsession with bone density, I have to ask: where does the light come from there? Did they have generators that imitated the sun? No matter. Anyway, there's no real plot, just a bunch of gothic wannabes with strange costumes trying to catch Kathy (probably so they can put a gag in her mouth). Stupid, meaningless movie. Thank you Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
