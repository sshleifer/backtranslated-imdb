I remember all the exaggerations about this movie when they killed Aaliyah. Being a fan of Mrs. Rice's novels, my first thought was "how can Queen Of The Damned be made without doing Vampire Lestat first?" <br /> <br /> Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it. that. If you have read these books, imagine taking the bloody parts of Vampire Lestat, putting Marcus and Marius in a single character, and eliminating everything related to the beginning of Lestat (the hunting of wolves, his violin, the Theater of vampires and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then, in the last 15 minutes stuck in Queen Of The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important piece of Lestat's character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he tries carefully to select murderers as his victims, and his love and hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> It is also important for the story that we lose the "Story of the Twins", which is the genesis of Mrs. Rice's vampires. And although I'm sure the cannibalism was too intense to show on the screen, they could have done something closer and show us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we have this love interest between us. Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni, it's about relationships between gay men, told by a woman. While I am sure that many men are opposed to the "homosexuality" of the characters, in this film they went to the opposite extreme. Instead of Lestat chasing murderers, chases the young female groupies. <br /> <br /> And the other flaws in the logic and the plot are huge. At first, Lestat emerges from a dream of a century, and then later asks Marius how he came to the 1950s with red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept during that period. It makes you wonder how Lestat knows about the fashion and music of the 50s, since he himself slept during the same period. And nothing is ever mentioned about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a great shame. It's like watching "Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> In general, the movie I thought was really bad. The only good thing about everything was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was deficient, the accents took me to the wall, and all the really deep parts of the book were eliminated, leaving us with only a hollow shell, something like Enkil after it was sucked. <Br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about modern vampires, get Lost Boys, the original Interview with a vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this piece rest, with a stake in the heart, garlic cloves around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> To finish, remember that before killing Aaliyah, this was meant to go directly to the video, no theatrical premiere was planned. It is obvious now why this was. It's just sad that someone as talented as she is is remembered by this dog from a movie, instead of something where she really could have shone. <br /> <br /> I qualify this with a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
