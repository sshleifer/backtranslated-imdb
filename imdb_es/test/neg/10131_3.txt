THE AFFAIR is a very bad television movie of the 1970s, starring the team of the then husband and wife of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a secluded existence as a writer of pop songs. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and is absolutely in love with her. Her adventure, as it is, is doomed from the beginning, and she knows it, but she goes ahead anyway. Two things to keep in mind if you are stuck in seeing this: the hairstyle of Jane Fonda de Wood who is never mistreated, no matter what, and a melody that sings at the beginning of this terrible movie. She sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's a classic filling between ads. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who sings the voice of Wood should have been shot and taken out of her misery. Also, check out all the tapas and dresses of the peasants. In comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with very short hair and wearing a series of classic suits.
