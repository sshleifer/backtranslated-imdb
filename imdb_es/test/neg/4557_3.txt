Another stinker from the PM Entertainment group and, fortunately, one of the last ones. <br /> <br /> 'Firetrap' is effectively a new version of 'The Towering Inferno' on a low budget. I do not mind the low budget of B movies for a long time. As it puts a little effort into them, there is no effort in 'Firetrap' are the stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously has all the acting skills of a porn star, but it turns out Being the best actor here and saying something, the rest are just a group of non-hopers who have received the loot of several day soaps. The special effects are just garbage, the shots that show the burning building from the ground are among the worst I've seen, the fire seems like someone wrote an orange pen on the front of the camera. In addition to that, there is not a single character to disappoint: you hate everyone and expect everyone to die well before the 90 minutes run out. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing: the red herrings are well signposted in Adelante, someone else has mentioned this, but "the scene in which the concierge fights a blazing fire that envelops the building with his broom. .. hilarious, or the same doorman who enters a room marked as "dangerous material", these scenes were supposed to be tongue in cheek? somehow I doubt it <br /> <br /> The only good thing and the only thing It was good that there was a bit of action between the daytime soap opera that kept my attention, but little attention was paid to everything that was in the film, I can not recommend it, look at 'The Towering Inferno' instead. <br /> < 3/10
