I'm a big fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic one. I consider that the best features of zombie films are the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This movie focused more on a "let's just make it bloody" view. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the ground and bring down the boy, there is blood coming out of the hole. I did not realize that the holes in the aircraft floors bleed so much. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst performance I've seen when she woke up and started feeling sick. I laughed quite hard when she died. I deserved it in every way. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused as to why Dr. Kelly could speak after becoming a zombie, but then another zombie said nothing because of the annoying screams and shrieks. And they seemed to be killing the zombies quite efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen, but when Dr. Bennett is ejected from the plane to the engine, eliminating most of his lower half, he can still live at the end. br /> <br /> I felt that they altered things to make a "good" scene. When one of the malicious girlfriends (I did not take the time to learn their names, they played a nonsense role) was in the bathroom, was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a bidirectional mirror to see Mile-High Clubbers? I've never broken a mirror on an airplane (bad luck and all that), but I doubt there's much space behind, with the incredibly limited space of the bathroom and everything. <br /> <br /> The few Redeeming qualities were too little too late, sadly. One thing that the film had in its favor was that of the flight attendants who smoked, although they felt the need to kill all but one. And I must admit that I laughed rather badly when the old woman bit Frank's arm and he said, "She's killing me" or something like that. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sad. I wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it from a minor redeems it a little, but still ... It failed on many levels. Stay with Dawn of the Dead and 28 days later.
