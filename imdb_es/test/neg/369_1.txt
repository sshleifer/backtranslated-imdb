I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and fake them in every episode of South Park (if they do not show them, then mention them) and they love to tease and tease and make fun of themselves too, but I felt that this mockumentary was too far. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the most common execution theme in the "documentary" is that their episodes are pieces of meaningless garbage that they put only for the money. Obviously, that is completely false if you bother to watch any episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." is said at the end of almost all episodes of the main characters. The creators are also represented as pompous and arrogant asses who only care about money, including a scene that is supposed to be fun but does not involve Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (by phone) and Trey Parker screaming and shouting He by sucking and hanging. I guess it was supposed to be fun, but his pretension really did ... he shuddered. <br /> <br /> The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to The Limit, all just for money, in the end. Completely false, obviously, and a whole joke, but it's not funny. It's disturbing, even if it's just a joke.
