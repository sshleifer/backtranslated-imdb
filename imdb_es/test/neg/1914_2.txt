I saw him on the cable because he was a big Leelee fan. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You do not care a bit about any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a complete idiot in the movie, and steals Josh Hartnett's girlfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this movie would have followed the proven formula and would have made Hartnett's ass, and Leelee as the girlfriend caught in a bad relationship, which she has saved thanks to Klein. But Hartnett is a really cool guy, who shows a lot of emotion and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> Then you hate Leelee, because she cheats on Hartnett with Klein, who is a jerk to everyone in the city who is trying to help him and really stayed. <br /> <br /> It is also very cheesy, and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and synchronizing their lips, and using brushes and spoons and fake microphones (although they are very close). <br /> <br /> What a horrible horrible movie. You do not even care what happens at the end because the director never lets you worry about the characters.
