A confusing, meaningless script with raster holes the size of the Eiffell Tower. Terrible performance of everyone involved - it's no exception! Ridiculous and cheesy dialogue Lick attempts at humor and romance. Extremely cheap special effects. All this makes for a giant mess of a movie, it is best to avoid.
