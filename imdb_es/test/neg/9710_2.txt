This movie is just bad. First, the story is rare and not well written. It leaves you with questions when you are finished. Sometimes that's fine, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> The acting is not nothing special. Adults do a good job, but children, considering they are children, do not do a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was the worst. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure that that was the main role. I never imagined who this movie was about. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some shots that stood out, but above all there was nothing interesting in the cinematography. The sound, however, was better. There was a good score. A small score of adventures, although it did not seem like an adventure movie. I had some elements of an adventure movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to say to whom this film was directed. Children? Barely. There is too much language and violence for that. Adults I do not know. I had many elements of a movie for children in it. It was like an adult movie in a children's movie. <br /> <br /> The story was simply strange. I do not have much idea of ​​what it really was. They threw you directly without knowing anything, but there were always references to something you felt you should know. The fact that the parents of the children died for example and that Mickey blamed Pete for it. You expected to know what happened, but you never did. <br /> <br /> All together, this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no impulse in her. Nothing that really advances the story. This is not what you spend your Saturday night.
