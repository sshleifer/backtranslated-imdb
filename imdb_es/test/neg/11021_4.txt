... BREAKER MORANT AND BREAK STOMPER. He has also provided us with films that can be seen, such as BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for everyone involved in this disaster, THE WOG BOY will not join to appear on any of the lists. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title, so politically incorrect that when it aired on BBC 2 late at night, the announcer did not even mention the name of the movie, so I expected something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw would fall in disbelief. He descended in disbelief, I realized that he could not believe that the financiers thought that this was going to be a great international success. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the cast and the script. I know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a lot of actors, so I will forgive most of it, but this does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this kind of comedy to work, you must be impressed with the comedic abilities of the main actor and I'm sorry to say it, but Nick G simply does not have the skills. I had never heard of him and had not seen anything else in what he was, so maybe it's much better in other performances. Here, however, it is simply irritating, unconvincing and I lost count in the number of times the camera was assaulted. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and, returning to the script, it seems to be very underdeveloped. I mean who I thought a joke about a female Minster Of Work that was taking her out in the back of a limousine was fun. You have the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said: "Look friend, this script is not good enough, go and make it more subtle and structured" <br /> <br /> I've been hard. and the severity has been requested in this review. I gave the film four out of ten and I would have only gotten three if it were not for the really funny sequence in which Steve is watching a current show just for himself flashing on the screen and labeled "Dole Blodger". This shows that the writers were aware of the comic moment and the social commentary. Too bad they did not come with a much better written film.
