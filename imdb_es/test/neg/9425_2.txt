First of all, let me clarify that I love airplanes, and it's usually worth watching any movie with them, and I've sat through some shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this movie. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this promotional film of the Strategic Air Command. The acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop seeing this horrible garbage halfway. This was despite some really good aerial photographs, maybe even the best ones. The problem is that, even for an aviation madwoman like me, doing something with the shocking plane that appears (B-36 and B-47) simply causes the nerves to become too entangled. It is a pity that the film was not made when the B-52 appeared, so the superlatives used for the airplane in this film would have been valid. Then I could have been able to sit through it. Maybe I'm missing the point of the film, which may be the anguish suffered by loved ones, while their loved ones are in active tasks. In any case, it could have done much better. Recommendation? Well worth missing.
