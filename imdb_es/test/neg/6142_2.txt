My grades: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character attachment - 1/10 Chart - 2/10 Character development - 2/10 General - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show is very official . For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I do not know, in the other CSIs you enter the episode you're watching. But in this, you can not enter the episode, no matter how hard you try, so in my opinion, it is not worth watching this program. I know that people have different opinions and I respect that, but for me, this CSI is not good enough. So, if you like the suspense, the real acting, the good plot, the direction, the development of the character / attachment and a good show in general, I suggest you see CSI Miami.
