I wish there was a lower grade than F to give it! I rated it with a 1 in the vote count. I'm calling it not like a regular movie, but like a T & A movie, and this is the most horrible movie, the worst, the most horrible and the most horrible I've seen. The acting, the history and the music is terrible, not to mention that there is not even nudity for the T & A connisuer.it about a male animator and the viewer is forced to sit through many painful scenes of him making cheers. Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! This is the worst of the teen movies of the bad 80s.
