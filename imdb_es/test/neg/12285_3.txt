1ยบ seen on 8/7/2004 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, a film focused on juveniles on three children who are included in their favorite cartoons with the experiment of their parents. The script left a lot to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara as the scam on some Saturday morning "live action with people in dinosaur costumes showing the kids" with some silly cavemen hanging around. Nothing to really admire about this and not much more to say. It just amazes me that I found this in a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and how the stores are getting rid of the old VHS movies. I guess they could not even sell it, so I went back to the rental rack.
