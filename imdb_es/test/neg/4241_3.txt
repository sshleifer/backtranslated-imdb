The female numbers in this program are impressive. They can also talk as if there were no tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would go to the bathroom quickly. How much money do they earn on all people who send text messages, with the hope that they will be called back to win, $ 100, or whatever? Boy, now that's a scam !!! Can I buy shares in this money maker? Let's face it, with the technology now, thousands of people could be calling every minute. And, with ten thousand channels and nothing worthwhile, thousands of people see this program. "Oh, I know this answer!", It's probably a very common line among listeners. With these super beauties constantly saying that the 'lounge' needs callers, I think it's a lot of B.S. Often, someone who does, sounds surprised that he is actually talking to the host. Many of them sound depressed and exhausted, probably waiting so long and trying so many times to go up and score some pocket change. Wow, the producers must be just raking. No wonder there are so few ads. The commercials are only available to give more time (mainly losers) to send text messages and wait, wait, dream and fantasize with --- what? --- Earn enough money for a gas tank and a dinner at Mc..something? I only see it from time to time on my brother's television, because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer. I will sit there for 15 to 20 minutes, I will look at Mel (one of the women with the best looks on TV) and I will laugh at the scam that is in front of me. Then, I have to go; even if I do not! People who have an active life, can only take this show with extreme moderation. Mel, get in the movies, or in television comedies, or something like that. Many of us are in love with you! Even with the super ties, I'm surprised that this show is still on!
