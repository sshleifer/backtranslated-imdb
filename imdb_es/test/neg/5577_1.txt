I checked carefully if there is another movie called like that, and there is not! But I really do not think we all saw the same movie! There is no way ! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie? The idea of ​​this film let's say it's acceptable. Oh, and the performance of Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. But those are the only two things acceptable in this project. The others are ... horrible? It is a very delicate word to describe the performance of the other actors, the direction, the "special" effects (as was said), even the way the crew was filming! I do not even like the way the camera operators moved to record the scenes! This may be the most miserable movie I've seen. I do not really remember a film that is lower than this ... Maybe there is one, but ... I do not think so ... Ehh, what's done is done ... That's the movie and it's too late for anyone change nothing. I voted "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (less) in front ...
