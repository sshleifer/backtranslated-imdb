Looking back on the year 2006, one of the things I will most remember is the "Snakeamania" on the Internet for a movie called Snakes on a plane. But for me, however, there was a scam movie called DVD Snakes. in a train! After seeing this, I feel that a B movie is better under the pair. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A husband and wife get on a train to Los Angles, to get help from the husband's uncle, who is a shaman. This is because the wife's family does not approve of marrying him, so he has been told that snakes "will become her". drive to Los Angeles and a group of passengers, including a former Narc policeman and some drug traffickers. Will they arrive in time before the snakes take her? <br /> <br /> Movie View: Effects first: I have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a bloody way, the main effect shots have to wait for eighty minutes to see them ! Unfortunately, it's so bad that they completely kill any good memories of the movie (the movie makes the 198o Video Games look like T2 next to this!). One of the things that I noticed is that there is no script credit in the movie! and the directors make the movie so anti-climactic that it ruins the whole movie. Final view of the film: <br /> <br /> A B movie below par, with an incredibly bad ending.
