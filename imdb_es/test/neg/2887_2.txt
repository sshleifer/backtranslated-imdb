However, once again, it is not bad enough to make it pleasant. In fact this is just boring. It is reasonably well done, even though the script is bad, the effects are fine and the average performance. (Apart from James Mason, which is always great, but in this underutilized) <br /> <br /> I guess it's hard to write something about this movie because it did not provoke any reaction. br /> <br /> Bored, no shine, no shine, no shine, no shine.
