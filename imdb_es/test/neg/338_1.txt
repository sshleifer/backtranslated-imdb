I have more than 10 years of computer games with better special effects! The plot is choppy and very predictable. Most actors look like extras without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a team of Scotties from Star Trek without personality or charm. Unnecessary scenes of people putting up tents! Tents with all the supposedly high-tech equipment! The actors seemed not to be sure that the camera was on them. Nothing that makes you worry if these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in the backyard and in the garage of someone with a low-end team! Nothing seems original or even a little entertaining. Do not waste your time!
