hey ... I really do not know why this movie has been so appreciated, maybe I did not understand the subject. In my view, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that have treated "schizophrenia" and informed, excited, shocked, evoked emotion and forced the audience to depart from their own reality and think ....... .. although it is true that the effort of aparna sen was ambitious, in light of all the other films, it falls short ... miserably ... it was too slow, there were no details about anything and the end ... it was completely ... useless ... it was not opened or something ... simply pointless ... so look at it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted ...
