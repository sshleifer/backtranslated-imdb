I could not stand to see much of this shit. This is your standard garbage that some annoying women love the old drama of the English era with many disguises and clichéd characters that seem to have been taken directly from the trick of Oliver or some other Dickens novel. This uses the usual clichés of the Victorian era. Certain idiotic people really think that all the emotional torture of that bloodily repressed culture is somehow fascinating and romantic. This is sap, pure and absolute and boring garbage like watching the grass grow. As such, it is perfect for women who crave some kind of romantic drama from the English countryside in a Victorian setting, but for this man this movie is nothing but a cruel and unusual torture and punishment to watch a lot of boring and monotonous scenes with non-original characters that speak in that forced Mischief and false English accent.
