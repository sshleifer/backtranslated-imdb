In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was an unknown unknown, an unproven actor who starred in one of his first films. And, as it was unknown, the film they gave him was clearly a B movie, a fast movie with relatively low expectations. After watching it, I could see why Bogart would still take many more years AND another film studio before it became a household name. While the movie is not terrible, it's certainly not good, so it's more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of building his own airplane engine. company. However, when a rich and empty playgirl appears in your path, all your dreams seem to be held in suspense. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water: they just do not mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart leaves his promising career, his sister leaves. At full speed on Road to Skankville, having met a man of poor quality who convinces her to sleep with rich men so they can shake them for a lot of money! Bogey has no idea that his sister is NOT the actress he claims to be and he does not realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose lover is ... Bogart's SISTER! All this leads to an end that is reasonably pleasant. However, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I've seen in a long time. At this point, the rich woman is not going to marry the boy who is sleeping with Bogey's sister (what a shame!), But since she is poor now and not good for Bogart, she is about to fly and commit suicide. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps to the plane as it takes off and crawls through the fuselage to take control of the plane and save it. This is so ridiculous and ridiculous that I laughed out loud. Until then, I could have obtained it with a 4 or 5, this has sunk the movie to a 3 (how a critic gave it an 8 is bigger than me). <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that this was a talking and silly movie. On top of that, everything is wrong for Bogart, since the action hero in the end and the lover simulator are horrible coincidences for his character that was created so wonderfully in the early 40's. Manly and Solid is better suited to man: one of the great actors of the United States, but it is clearly out of their element here. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love Pre-Code movies and their very adult sensibility may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes and practices premarital sex and Bogey curses at the movie, things that they would never have seen after the hardened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.
