I'll give you this: I did not stop looking, and it's not corporate, which is great. But my inner critic blew it to pieces, I guess I see too many movies. Writing wood, the jargon simply cracks without any flow. The edition, mentioned before, is unpredictable; sometimes it evokes a good ghetto sensation, but above all it is irritating: interspersed and peculiar angles and very muted facial close-ups. The actors were marginal, although Letisha had her moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the audience cares about Curtis, it's a total mistake and the actor has no expression and is not particularly funny or attractive. Management does not help you love or hate it, not even; I just wanted him to shut up and they shot him. I did not care about his impotent revenge when it was spinning. The completely predictable ending is not credible at all. I'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some of the old successful distributors he deposits are stupid enough to fall for their little scams. "Oh, they just got out of jail and they're on probation - here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, run around the corner for me, now do not steal from me, etc." <br /> <br /> A good sex scene at first gave me hope, but in the end I was disappointed. The handling of a rape scene was a little high, although only a little interesting. There are better films in this genre that do not insult your intelligence by trying a kind of authentic ghetto realism while resembling more a film school offer. 4/10, an F.
