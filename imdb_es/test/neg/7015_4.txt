In 1967 I saw an outstanding musical at Wintergarden in New York City, where Angela Lansbury plays the stage as Mame. But, did Hollywood give him the leadership? Not Lucille Ball great as Lucy was given the role. She killed the movie. That mistake. There was no chemistry, as there was on stage. Bea Arthur and Angela, what a great couple when they sang!
