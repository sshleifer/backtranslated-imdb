Each film made by Quentin Tarantino has progressively worsened. I would like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing that "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has an 8.5 / 10 of more than 100,000 classifications, it does not seem to be the general public that goes to the movie theater. It makes some sense Even their best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that affirming that you like Tarantino's work has become fashionable. As soon as that happens, you'll get lots of people ready and willing to get into another car. They will ignore the ridiculously terrible performance and the totally indulgent writing so that they can be part of the exclusive club called "todos". This movie is so terrible, I swear it must be some sort of crooked Tarantino joke to see how much torture its fans will tolerate and still praise it. As another critic said: "Tarantino's previous films were of a guy in love with other movies, this one is of a guy in love with his own writing." I could not agree more. This film is nothing but self-indulgent and enigmatic writing combined with the ability to act out of a high school work. But, thanks to the fact that the general movie will be made public, I'm sure it will continue to be one of the best films ever made. Bravo, tarantino. You have achieved one of the best practical jokes of all time.
