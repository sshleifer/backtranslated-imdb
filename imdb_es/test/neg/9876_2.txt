I never read the book. Now I really do not want to. I had no idea what this movie was about when I entered the theater. I still do not really know what point I was supposed to convey, but I do know that two good hours were wasted from my life. Two precious hours that I will never be able to return. <br /> <br /> The story was so predictable, it's ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... a plot very Romeo and Juliet. Predicted the end within five minutes in the movie. And he was right <br /> <br /> The acting is not horrible. The only two great characters in the film were the British cousin and the dubious graphic novel Rambo. The other characters are also ... the dialogue is very insipid and predictable. <br /> <br /> The MOST POWERFUL part of the film is the transformations between "humans" and "wolves". If you wanted something great like Van Helsings, you'll be really upset. Imagine a dancer, a bright light, and then a wolf. If that is all. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you've read the book, because you only want to hit the babies.
