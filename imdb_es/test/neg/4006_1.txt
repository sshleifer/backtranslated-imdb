The fact that I was one of them was probably having a brain problem at the time of renting it. Anyone who really buys it, will enjoy using this as a roller coaster. Maybe a frisbee? This is a DVD that I actually found in front, where children could find it. Since the DVDs do not seem to be in the position to be placed in the back room of a story with all the big boxes that have the tapes, I find it quite annoying that they would play this next to a Disney movie. Yes, going from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost has shown what we all think of Disney, right? I still have not come down so low. There is no performance here. The only interesting thing is the old movie trailers of 1973 for old erotic movies that I'm surprised they escaped being burned to hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allows zero, it would be 0/10)
