When Kristy Swanson receives an attack from the culprits on what she does, she wants to leave. Unfortunately, Madsen is his immediate superior in a company where "giving two weeks notice is not an option". <br /> <br /> As a teenager killing vampires, Kristy did a very good job. The image of the valley girl seemed to fit. But as a killer in the race ... well, Kristy keeps running. Run, run away! This film is not a concept that has not been done before, but it has become better! <br /> <br /> I did not want to see the rest of this movie, but I felt I should do it if I wanted to give a review of this movie. I've always liked Madsen, and his character was a little predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time to see and do ... no wonder it never premiered theatrically!
