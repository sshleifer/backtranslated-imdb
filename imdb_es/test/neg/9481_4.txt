This film is quite predictable nuff said ... from the scene of late kisses to the inevitable arrival of grandpa ... this is a great movie for the age group of 10 to 12 years, but beyond that has no market ... I give it 4/10 only because it achieved exactly what it was proposed to do and nothing else.
