This movie was a complete and disappointing one. There was no development of the story. The spectators were involved in the story without explanation and allowed themselves to try to solve what was happening. The action sequences were fine but they were confusing. They were not The Matrix and they were not Crouching Tiger. It is better to leave this movie on cable TV, where you do not have to pay to see it or convince a friend that you should hire it and then go see it. As a big Jet Li fan, I expected more. How can someone involved with Once Upon a Time in China put their name to this one?
