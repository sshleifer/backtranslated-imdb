Dear reader, Beware! This movie is not really a movie, although its creators have the impertinence to call it that. If you have not been warned about its content, here goes: the film is simply a sequence of images that flow continuously and are trying to convey a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, its purpose is to create an atmosphere as well. However, the images that the director has chosen can only convey feelings to a US audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons. Although the film tries to express the idea of ​​"civilized war", it does not do it not only because of the general chaos but also because it is too long and boring, and I felt that many of the scenes have not got to do with the "war", in any conception. To conclude, I was very disappointed by a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in the processing of images.
