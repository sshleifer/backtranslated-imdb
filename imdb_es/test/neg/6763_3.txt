Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Along with auxiliary personnel of the Air Force and a comical geek, they are in charge of a super secret underground laboratory on the west coast. Morrow is excited when he discovers a meteorite that passes through the atmosphere, but baffled when the meteorite decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows what this colossal is. , the structure in blocks is. Obviously, it is a kind of carpentry artifact because everything is made of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on the top. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, nicknamed Kronos, is by far. planet and has been sent here to steal the land of energy. You see, here on earth, we have learned how to convert matter into energy, but on the planet Kronos you have discovered the other half of the equation: how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Are you taking notes on this? All right. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can inform me about some of the scientific questions raised by the Kronos mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why do not they simply convert some of their spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to the ground to turn off LA lights? But it is doubtful that the writers can explain it either. Reversing the polarities of two antennas is described as an "anthropic conversion," meaning a "change to the human," which makes no sense. But it does not seem that any of the sciences makes sense for that matter. The diagram that Morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Kronos locomotion. March along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read Southern California), but has no joints on its two or three legs. These stumps just slowly strike up and down, crushing some people. The movie does not make much of these people crushed. They show themselves as Mexican peasants, so maybe they do not count too much. The US Air Force UU He also launches a hydrogen bomb to Kronos: while in Mexico, of course. Nobody raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> It does not take much action and there is not much happening. Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, ideal for radio or for voices on TV. His face is less expressive. He only has one expression, no matter what the situation: a tense smile, as if he were being photographed at the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a good golden quality when she did "Street With No Name" a few years before. She was a thin seventeen-year-old woman like Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her grooming and behavior reduce her to the level of B movie actress, although she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies. He did many, I confused them. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the movie is flat. (However, there are some good pictures of a B-47 in flight.) The sets reveal a low-budget company. That is not necessarily bad in itself, but there is nothing to compensate for the sterile configurations. Little tension in the script, no presentation of direction and little effort in the proceedings. <br /> <br /> It is possible that I give you a kick, a relaxed stop, because this is clearly challenging. It's just that there are many better films of the genre out there.
