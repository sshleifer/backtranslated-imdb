A lot of teenagers gather to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has appeared and is killing everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror movie of the 90s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only movie that could challenge him for that title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations to decorate a screen of TV. The so-called surprise ending is horrible, as is the rest of this movie. A little entertaining at such a bad level is good. My rating: 2 out of 10.
