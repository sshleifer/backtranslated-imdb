I admire the effort of trying to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the movie is VERY GOOD that most people I know could not read it. The film was relevant for me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it is written in a horrible way and it does not manage to catch the attention of someone who does not know anything about it. The music options do not flow well with the movie, it seems as if someone had put a CD player in the background to put the actors "in the mood". The acting ... well, what action? The only people acting are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. As for the development of the relationship between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it's like watching a train crash. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments". This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to spread a message (it could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. This is a failure and anyone who says otherwise makes me wonder if you are trying to promote it. In fact, as a native of Estonia, I feel offended by this miserable endeavor. This tragedy deserves more than a simple excuse for a movie made by low budget ghosts. This could have been much more!
