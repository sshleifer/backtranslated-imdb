I am the kind of person who loves Hood's films from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from grade b to Hollywood. But this movie was something different. I do not hate and this movie was a little nice. But some bits were rare. Well, the performance was not good, compared to the performance of Silkk The Shockers in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in Jack and SVU (great). In the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills who wants to be a Jamaican uncle, says something and sets fire burning both Ice-T and the other uncle, this kills the Jamaican. The film Urban Threat (which stars these two actors) in which the character of Snoops is supernatural, however, after this is not suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) is stabbed at the beginning, he fights, but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh, WITHOUT BLOOD. and when MJ confesses to killing a policeman because the policeman was hitting his friend Benny was strange, Benny did not show up in this movie and the scene is not in the film. He does not care about the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but still makes you scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to the character of Miss Jones explaining what happened to them after this, does not mention what happened with two other main characters, MJ and Lisa. The film showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto, which plagues the lives of Latinos and blacks around the world, was a good part of the film, although the clip of the projects was reused thousands of times. and the scene in which Miles kills the Latino brother crashing his bicycle at full speed (without wearing a helmet) and hitting the car of my Latin brother, would kill him. The film was similar to the movie Urban Menace and half of the actors were in both films, as well as in the production team. It was fine though, but I'm from poverty, I love Hood's movies, however, if you do not love them like me, you DO NOT. The only thing that saved me from leaving is that it reminded me of the first movie I made, which was made with 100 dollars, and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
