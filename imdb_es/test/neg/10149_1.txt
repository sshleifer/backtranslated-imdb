I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local box office success and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one, since we have seen almost all the movies created. We decided to look at the low budget horror section. We look for the most attractive cover with women with little clothes. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Wow, we made a mistake. It seems that this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart. The actors were picked up in a Salvation Army, and as for Steven Tyler. We will leave that to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT While watching the movie, there is absolutely no closure. Then come to discover that all the events were just a dream. This movie should also have lasted about 30 minutes. If the whole camera were focused on fixed shots and the scans were removed from the walls, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is that I'm glad there is not a sequel.
