One of the last great survivors of the terror screen, Conrad Radzoff, dies and places his body in a mausoleum with televised fragments before the death of the great Conrad, who greet him while he visits him. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls, and taken to a large mansion where they drink with him, toast, dance with him, laugh with him and then put him . He lies in a coffin, which happens when lying in a room on the top floor. The news about the lost body reaches the widow of Radzoff and her friend (who turns out to be very skilled in the black arts) and she celebrates a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he, in his own words, can Get an eye for an Eye, tooth for a tooth Well, Frightmare is an interesting "bad" movie Sure, it's cheap The sets look like they were borrowed (which I'm sure they were) Special effects and blood and the entrails are performed liberally and with little credibility, the performance is average below average with some exceptions, Jeffrey Combs, of Re-Animator, has fame, but in reality he has recently in this role quite ungrateful as a teenager obsessed with the terror that needs to steal the body of a dead man to kick it in. None of the "kids" except the pretty girl who plays with Meg is good, Nita Talbot plays the Radzoff "friend" with great interest. , look for the big one, I mean the great man who plays the policeman. That is the same Porky of Porkys fame. But fortunately for all of us, a performance exceeds the material. Ferdy Mayne, a German actor often overlooked who had the characteristics of Christopher Lee and starred as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a job more than worthy of praise as the icon of horror aged in public life and the real devil of a man in private life. . Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life, lives only for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is dead (obviously, none of the teenagers at that time). Mayne can look very real, speak very smartly and transmit threats with ease. If for no other reason, one should see Frightmare for his performance. I make; however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used images of Christopher Lee (does anyone have any ideas?). Anyway, one can guess what happens and, indeed, it happens: Radzoff goes out and chases the children who disturbed his peace. Once again, the formula is trite and over used. The acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction is so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ​​ineptitude. It is definitely worth taking a look. Seeing Mayne continue to appear on the screens in his mausoleum brought an ironic smile to my lips each time.
