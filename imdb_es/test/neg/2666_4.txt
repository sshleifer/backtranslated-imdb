Michael Myers, the deranged, no longer so young psychopath, who seems to grow stronger with each appearance, is resurrected by his druid brothers to destroy more threats on his family members and anyone else who gets in the way. The gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who originally preferred chokes and kitchen knives, learns to swing an ax and use the necessary means to eliminate his victims, and the result is a horrible, patched-up dollar movie, almost unaided by a few really creepy sequences. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story simply so that "someone" can be considered the star. You will not want to cover your eyes during this, but you will shake your head down on the downward slide of John Carpenter's classic creation.
