I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfying experience. <br /> <br /> It is a visually rich film but with a slow direction, a poor plot and a two-dimensional characterization. <br /> <br /> I did, however, I knew this when I entered. I was willing to trust the two gentlemen with whom I was (knowledgeable comics connoisseurs) that the images would be out of the ordinary and they were. Unfortunately, the inexperience of the management meant that scene after scene passed with little dramatic tension or conflict. However, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to the screen and who are in charge of the address. The rhythm of the story is lost as the camera dwells lovingly in the beautiful images. <br /> <br /> I would not have gone at all without the assurance that it would be worthwhile to see the style of the film. I have tried with the work of Neil Gaiman, but I always have the feeling of "the emperor's new clothes". I live with hope, but last night was no exception. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman's work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all their faults are described eloquently. However, I can not understand how he imagined that he had an understanding of the mind of a fifteen-year-old girl, nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum of human knowledge about how to grow up and take on adult responsibility, or change. of relationship that a girl could have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and are handled ineptly, stereotyped and without depth of imagination. All the beautiful images of the world can not compensate for a defective work piece in the nucleus.
