Others have mentioned the inane dialogue in this series and I agree. <br /> <br /> If mom and daughter were really that ingenious, they should be the queen and the princess of the universe, not kicking in a small town. <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch some episodes, but when the clever buzz of pop culture starts turning the channel. <br /> <br /> I saw a bit of a new episode to see if something had changed (for better what I had expected) but no, the same old man "we are so smart with our references to pop culture" that I almost vomited . <br /> <br /> Long time fans I'm not happy with the new seasons, they may just be getting up and getting tired of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.
