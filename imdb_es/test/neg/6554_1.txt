<br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly funny, makes any man want to cry, the clich√© is placed in more than 5 years of peanut butter and in such a way that it actually extracts humor from his heart. all the jokes were badly programmed and would not have been fun if they had been timed correctly. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie, there is a real possibility that you will never be able to enjoy going to comedies again. ...forever.
