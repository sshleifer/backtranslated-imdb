I know everyone said that this movie was crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing him telling other people that he was shit. I recommended that they not see it. But when it came out on television, we saw the ad. I went to my family and said: "I know this is sad, but I'm thinking of seeing it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, me too." And you know what? It was fun. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie in any way. It is absolutely a waste of time. But it is a good waste of time. You can still think it's crap and it's fair enough, but I thought it was a really fun slapstick comedy. I did not like a couple of things, like when the car hit the fish, but other than that I thought it was good. I loved sitting there and choosing all the famous faces of Australia: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, watch a drama or something like that.
