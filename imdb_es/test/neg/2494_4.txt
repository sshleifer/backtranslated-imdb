It is easier to see this movie if it is seen as a scenario created by Lieutenant Reginald Barclay of Starfleet during his addiction to the holodeck. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz). <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is a villain like Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow two-dimensional figure from a telenovela. Paul Newman is also a villain like General Leslie Groves, but the problems of this film go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The factual errors and the great freedoms taken (with the chronology of the events) for the political agenda of the advanced screenwriter Bruce Robinson makes this film shameful. That's probably why this movie has found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combine bad science, bad history, bad screen writing and mediocre performance to produce a film that should not be seen by impressionable high school or college students who do not know anything about the Manhattan Project.
