One day I thought: what is the worst that could happen today? I answered with a simple, "Oh, it happened, I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the film cuts scenes of sex and death scenes. There is a funny phrase that I can remember, and the performance is much worse than the first. It seems that there is no lighting in the "set" (the forest somewhere) and the murderous clown known as Killjoy (which makes Leprechaun look like The Exorcist) is less than spectacular. This time, he is not represented by Angel Vargas and he has completely changed as a character from a crazy and irritating clown to a different kind of crazy and irritating clown who says a lot "CHILD". Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass ... is this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of lies lies Killjoy 2. His evil is underestimated. This film has no redeeming quality, except the song at the end of the credits ... which, at least, provides some enjoyment. Killjoy 2 is not even really a movie, but an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie I've seen. SPOILER MINOR ######### Let me describe one of the supernatural death scenes. A girl is locked in a wooden shed of some kind (maybe a dependency?) When Killjoy peeks through a hole. He has some small teeth chattering (like those you can buy at Spencer's Gifts) and does something with them (maybe he rolls them up!). Then he has them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can not be written in IMDB). From what I gather from this scene (not from what is shown in the movie), the teeth entered the unit and killed the girl in an interesting way, but not shown, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were those teeth I would have run. Run away from Killjoy so I can never get my hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is the last Killjoy that we will have to endure. Even as a fan of movies, others would say they are very bad, I think this "movie" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this movie and anything that reminds us of that would be destroyed. I give it 2/10, simply because the creators managed to make the images move.
