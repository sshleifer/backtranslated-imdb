"Two wildlife photographers travel through the Amazon basin in their last task, while trying to capture the wildlife of the area in a movie, our photographers come across a hunting hunter, who is stalking the animals for another reason, seeking to eliminate Witnesses from their illegal activities, the hunter decides. " According to the synopsis of the sleeve of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The handsome guide Peter Brown (as Jim Pendrake) brings the beautiful blonde Ahna Capri (as Terry Greene) and his handsome brother Tom Simcox (as Art Greene) to the Venezuelan jungle, to admire the view , and take pictures of the wildlife. After they hooked up with the hunky big game hunter William Smith (as Caribbean), the psychological dramatization emerges. <br /> <br /> A fundamental scene, with Mr. Brown resting on the "v" of a tree and sharing a cigarette with Mr. Simcox, is very well organized. The circular direction reappears in the later "fight" between Brown and Mr. Smith; and, it is effective. Simcox's early sexual romp does not add anything to the story; could have been cut, to take advantage of what seems to flirt between the characters of Brown and Simcox. An attraction between Brown and Mrs. Capri could also have been played. <br /> <br /> The music, including "Love All Things That Love the Sun" by Jim Stein, is fine; but the film needs to be traced, to cut out animals that do not appear on the screen. And, there are too many superfluous images on display. "Piranha" is a case where less would have been more.
