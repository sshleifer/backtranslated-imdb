Imagine Diane de Cheers, the egoist centered on the intellectual character, now imagine that she was trying to make a moir√© movie. That's all. If you just looked at some of the shots without any sound, you would think Hmmm ... this could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now, if you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you quickly realize that the person who made the movie knows nothing about movies beyond what they read in a book. I continually thought that this is a foreign movie, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you do not remember Cheers, then think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the DeFoe character that made the horrible movie ... well imagine that horrible movie without Mr. Bean saving it. That's what this movie is. I'm not saying anything about the movie, other than an attempt to make a bad-tempered movie about a successful man who returns home ... at least that's all I can get out of that.
