This movie started out as a pretty decent movie, but it never really started, instead it became predictable and even a little silly. Some scenes were done quite well, the photography and the cuts were used in combination with the sounds and that made it a bit more interesting to watch, but since the story was quite slow, it did not keep the interest alive. And most importantly, it's not scary at all! It's supposed to be a horror movie, but there was not a single scene that was so scary or even exciting ... <br /> <br /> To be frank, the actors were not so cool, or colorful characters either. he will remember it for the rest of his days .. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie that can be seen, but does not add anything and once you finish watching it, it will not last long until you have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> The reason I saw it was because I had read a review giving it the best grades, but I do not agree and instead I would rate it 4 out of 10. If you still want some Japanese horror, I suggest you watch it Ju-on instead! <br /> <br />
