sdiner82 clearly had not seen the movie in decades, and his memory is frightening. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving scene as a suspect are completely wrong, as are his inaccurate comments about the bad boy "peeping into the child's body". Lester is dressed the entire time the man is in the room, and the man just glances at him. <br /> <br /> The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body. <Br /> <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's badly done, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Even sdiner82's comments about the character of Savalas who "casually sent a German family to his death by pushing his trailer from a cliff" is nonsense (she was a single woman, she was already dead and I was in a car). <br /> <br /> I suggest that the revision of sdiner82 says much, much more about yours, far from the liberal mentality. , what he does with this film without value. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I even bothered to look for it, was out of curiosity to see if it was done before or after Kojak. <br /> <br /> The movie is a useless piece of garbage from the 70s, but the revision of sdiner82 is the worst kind of slander. He concludes his review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is absolutely wrong in almost all the "factual" matters he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he searched for, which is disturbing. Now you can re-burn copies of Catcher in the Rye.
