So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but neither are many. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe I'm the only one). Apparently, Boll bought the rights to use Far Cry a long time ago, even before the game itself was finished. <br /> <br /> It should be noted to people who have enjoyed killing mercenaries and infiltrating secret research laboratories located on a tropical island, that this is not Far Cry ... This is something Mr. Boll has planned along with his legion of schmucks .. Feeling alone on the set, Mr. Boll invites three of his compatriots to play. These players have the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names that have actually made them pretty big in the movie business. So the story is this: Jack Carver, played by Til Schweiger (yes, Carver is German, say hello to the guys who eat sausages!) However, I think Tils acting in this movie is pretty bad. People have complained that he is not staying. faithful to Carver's entire agenda, but we only saw Carver in a first person perspective, so we do not really know what it was like when he kicked a ** .. <br /> <br /> However, the story of this history The movie is beyond the demented. We see the crazy and evil scientist, Dr. Krieger, played by Udo Kier, making genetically mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called. Perform your top secret investigation on an island that reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver for some reason. That's right there are no palm trees here. Instead, we have some nice rich lumberjack woods. We have not even left MUCH before we started crying (mehehe). I can not go on ... If you want to stay true to Bolls' shenanigans, go see this movie, you will not be disappointed, it offers you the true Boll experience. most of this will stink. <br /> <br /> There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good job in some areas of the film, like a good pot and fight scenes. Until all the chromed / albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything makes me laugh ... The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you, simpletones) of a fa, r if you want to take a fight, go ahead. BTW Carver gets a very annoying companion that makes you want to shoot the first three minutes that is on the screen.
