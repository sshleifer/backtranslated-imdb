Interestingly, I have very little to say about "The Box", so it will be quite brief. I have never read Richard Matheson's novel "Button, Button", on which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation", it could not have looked like the work of such a legendary author. "The Box" is about a family that discovers a strange gadget on its door that has a button. Frank Langella appears and explains how they will be given a million dollars if they press the button. The only "catch" is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere ... SPOILER? They push it END OF SPOILERS? The whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow managed to extend the film to a fake Stargate star that completed it to a decent enough ending with a pretty deep message. While I try to be as "just" as possible, I must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me very much. I guess it's from the same director as "Donnie Darko," which I remember liking when I saw him years ago. "The Box" would have worked well as a short film, but since it was adapted in this way without life, I can not come close to recommending it ...
