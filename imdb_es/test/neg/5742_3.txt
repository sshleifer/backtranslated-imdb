Slayer begins in the tropical rainforest of South America where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a group of Vampires, who barely manage to escape with their lives. Advance six months later and Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) informing him that other sightings of Vampires have been seen and that his ex-wife and his goddaughter, Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) have stepped out. there, on an expedition to study beetles, he worried that he would ask Hawk to take a squad of soldiers to South America and officially provide a backup to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while at the same time unofficially I was looking for Laurie and they did not kill her because of the vampires that have decided to venture out of the caves and into the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook, this is another original from the Channel of Science Fiction badly done, which simply is not Not very good in any respect. As far as I could see, the script without humor has nothing to do, it is one of those modern vampire films that decides to choose and choose the rules of tradition of the vampire movies you want to use, since these vampires can be killed with bets Through the heart and the fangs they have, but at the same time they can walk freely in the sunlight and do not sleep in the coffins. The film moves at a reasonable pace, but everything is very boring, soft and lifeless. The story is poor and quite stupid, the characters are terrible, the dialogue is forgettable and there are very few recommendations. Slayer also tries to have some kind of ecological message while the vampire boss claims that they are only starting to kill human beings due to their systematic destruction of the rainforest where they have lived in secret for centuries, unfortunately there is no conviction there and it is more like a line disposable to fill the time that a statement would be. There's not enough exploitation content and it's a pretty unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The creators do not even do anything with the environment of the jungle, hell did not expect Predator (1987), but expected more than this. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook has made several horror movies, all of them What I've seen has been equally poor, I'm sorry, but he does not do anything here and it becomes a completely forgettable movie and appearance . There is no atmosphere or tension, and as for the real fears, forget it. The blood is restricted, there are some bitten necks and a bit of blood spray, but it's nothing that we have not seen before or it has a lot of impact. There is also a huge vampire monster creature at the end, but it does not seem so impressive and it kills too easily. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of around $ 2,000,000, it actually had a decent size amount. the money spent on it, but it's still a garbage movie, it's reasonably well done, but it's nothing special or memorable. The performance sucks, I'm sorry but that's the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another poor, stupid and boring garbage made for television that I can not recommend. . It should not be confused with the excellent British film "Sasty" by Nasty Video, The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this, so keep track and look at that.
