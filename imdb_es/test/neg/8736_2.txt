"A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being, his work has reached the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult in a few days. it is a (spoiler omitted), but the side effects of the process (spoiler omitted), "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. <br /> <br /> "Embryo" starts with the promise: "The movie you're about to see is not all science fiction, it's based on the medical technology that currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb. a possibility tomorrow or today, "according to Dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Right. And, later, Dr. Joyce Brothers appears at a party with Roddy McDowall. <br /> <br /> First, we see that Rock Hudson (like Dr. Paul Holliston) lights a cigarette and drives recklessly (watch the speedometer!) during a storm; Unfortunately, he hits a dog. Mr. Hudson takes the injured canine home. She learns that she is pregnant and manages to save the life of one of the puppies, due to her experimental knowledge of fetal growth. What really comes down to this is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo, so that it can survive outside the mother's uterus. The dog, the "Number One", grows to become an adult and passes as his mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (as Martha Douglas); Since his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident.

Then, Hudson decides to use his accelerated growth of embryos in a human, Barbara Carrera (as Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast do their best; but, the plot of the "Embryo" is an absurd nonsense. If you take away her stupid opening and closing scenes, Ms. Carrera's brave characterization almost works; She could have been a bigger star, if they offered her better movies than this one. The infantile ending suggests a sequel; But, happily, the idea was aborted.
