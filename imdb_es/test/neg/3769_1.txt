On the cusp of being unbearable. Somehow, I was only interested a little, but was it because I really wanted to know what the "secret" was (which, I must say, is quite obvious) or because I expected Scarlett Johansson to put on a sexier outfit? This film is poor and, what is more, it is a disgrace for all the lonely and alcoholic teachers of southern literature. Travolta wants his Oscar to be so bad that he is willing to cry drunk in the bathroom after urinating blood. I'm sorry friend. . . You were more credible is "Stay alive." Not everyone can get Peter Fonda in "Ulee's Gold". If you want the Oscar against the brave hero against the guy you have to, um, really act. . Not just pouting on the screen. Stop this director before he / she (the name is vague as to gender) redirect!
