I made great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I do not really have time to write reviews, but I felt that this was my duty as a fan of science fiction horror. This is just the second review I've written. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucks. Plain and simple. I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those "lovely" comments. I've seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, whatever and I've seen it. But this really sucked. I do not care how much it cost or did not cost, movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and all the cast and crew were arrested and jailed for murder in time. By the way, did I mention that this movie stunk? I mean really sucked. The plot did not exist and the performance was weak. It seems that the writer saw Pitch Black and was upset because he did not think of a plot like that first, so he decided to make his own version scammed. But instead, the suction factor took over and possessed it. Do not look at this You'll have more fun if you take off your pants and sit on burning coals.
