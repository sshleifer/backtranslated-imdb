The Hell's Angels did lose in this movie. Sonny told the director that NO ONE does this to the Anglos and gets away with it. His version was that both types would be shot dead, but his suggestion was ignored. They were inclined to appear, let alone be "technical advisors" in a stink bomb of a movie like this. The angles of hell on JAP bikes? Let's go! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, "F $ # K Harley Davidson!" and that if they were smart, they would be riding Hondas.) (ST1100) He reads his car ... he hates Harleys. sewing sounding Japanese bicycles? Not too intimidating.They laughed outside the city.
