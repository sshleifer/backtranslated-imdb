Although this movie was fine. I do not think it was great. It was a bit too slow for my liking. A lot of drama, but not much action until almost the end of the movie. This movie was basically a dramatic one. film, with the reward, if you can call it that, not until near the end. For me, the scenes of the dam and the water flooding the city were fine, but too short. The movie itself is fine, The acting is decent, but in the long run it did not do it for me. I think it had something to do with the fact that it generated very little suspense or tension throughout the entire movie. At least that's what I think. The other factor is that I just saw '10 .5 'and its sequel '10 .5: Apocalypse'. They are 2 large budget event films ", which, in my opinion, are a very difficult act to follow, in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction, as a result, I have to qualify to Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke in 4/10
