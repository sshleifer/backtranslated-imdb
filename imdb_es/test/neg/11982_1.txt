It just came through the whole movie ... Acting is bad, the dialogues are even worse. I was a little surprised to see it, but it was named as one of my favorite games, so I fought against it. They even ruined the sound. In certain parts of the movie, the background music is so loud that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great, if it were a competition over who can fuck more. <br /> <br /> Oh and PS: I do not know what this "Uwe" guy is capable of creating ... I certainly do not know. I think this movie is bad just because he is the director. I checked the list of his work, and this is his first (and probably the last) creation I've seen. <br /> <br /> again and again.
