Oh no, one of these attacks from Japanese ghost girls movies ... I do not even remember how many I've seen. Maybe it's sold ... but not to me. It is not scary at all. Japanese horror movies have been very similar since the first of them ... also the pull of the child. I've seen that so many times on stage in so many horror films. the cell phone scene is nothing new either ... the dramatic thing about the boy getting hit by a train a little bit sucked ... I mean it lacked all the drama ... Well, this is for children from 14 to 16 years old They listen to Japanese rock and think they are so unique ... let's let you tell you. there is a million of you = D this is one of them. 3/10 I've seen it worse, but you will not miss anything by NOT seeing this!
