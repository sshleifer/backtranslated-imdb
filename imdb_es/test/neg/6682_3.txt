This was the first feature of Clinton, I was there, while he shot in Adelaide around 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I was not directly involved in the production, I witnessed the typical delirious behavior, set of publications, which was reduced: the parties, the drugs, the illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a by-product of young and talented people who are trapped in the classic ideologies of Fama and world position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another opportunity with a more mature script ... there are the problems, and I'm sure it's much better. The work will be done, if there is a next time. Because, frankly, certainly did not do any favor with this in your CV and neither did the cast ... but hey, it was a paid job, in a country where actors die of hunger regularly <br /> <br /> In summary, it is fascinating to see "the creation of" basically, it is not so fun to experiment (alas!).
