As the above suggests, ultimately this film did not impress me. It is beautiful to see it, the landscape is exuberant, but the detail of the story, in particular the characters, is totally incredible. Movies do not have to be credible, but movies like this, with a political advantage and a social commentary, yes. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this should not make casting decisions based solely on the box office draw. This is absolutely the case of Sutherland, which frankly is a garbage like Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent IS his performance and we ended up with a caricature of Irish without personality outside his nationality. It seems totally implausible to me that someone involved thought he was the best man for the job. In general, this is a clear case of commercial interest on quality and when you try to be The Mission, this kind of thing ruins your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there was a couple of other problems, one of them is the surprising modernity of Boy's accent that acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. More surprising was the acclaimed Irish accent of Samantha Morton, which was variable to say the least. His voice snaked between the strong north and the soft south, even in the voiceover, where I would have expected such discrepancies to be detected. <br /> <br /> However, these are minor complaints compared to Sarah's motivation and actions. She never seems to be at home with English, and almost instantly at home with her son and her tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she was offered, simply seems to be a truism. Maybe a lot was lost in the editing, maybe it was a three-hour movie or a mini-series where these things could have developed, but I can only judge what I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now the biggest problem, the relationship of Sarah (Morton) with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that his affection for him is not transmitted in any way until he has to choose between him and his son, the conflict he goes through at this point was downright ridiculous and he killed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. This movie did not work at all for me, but it's top notch, you really will not see anything more impressive in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.
