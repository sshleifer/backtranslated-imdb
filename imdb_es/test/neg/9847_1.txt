This film tried to capture the naive idealism that many young teenagers have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that I could not establish these things at all levels; so he did not manage to build a decent story around him. I could not follow the point of any part of this story, or any reason why I should care. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an exploration of pedophilia at all. Basically it is a girl who is in love with her sister, and her sister is in love with the idea of ​​"men". While the last one tests her love for men, the former tries to recover her sister by "matching up". <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the reality is similar. to an amateur pornographic filmmaker (without the sexual substance).
