The best scene of "The People Across The Lake" is the genuine night scene that presents a house, a murder and a lake. After that, it's pretty downhill from there when it comes to horror. A family (mom, dad, sister and younger brother) is fed up with the (slightly) dangerous environment of the suburbs, and decides to go live near the titular lake. As of that moment, the film presents too many happy nonsense related to the family near the lake, and occasionally some corpses appear here and there. The pair of scenes in which they discover the bodies are quite convincing (in terms of chills), but they are in sharp contrast to the rest of the events (with things from the daily life of the family that are installed). The truth about the issues (the mystery about who is killing) is learned too soon, leaving only the family without knowing and the spectator yawning during the uninteresting end (presenting a discovery in a basement and running around the house), as if This thing done for television suddenly remembered that it was supposed to be a horror movie. It's not really badly done; The content and the story are not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, although his acting / character is too ridiculous to take it seriously. The beautiful blonde Tammy Lauren (the daughter) could also be a recognizable face for the avid horror addicts, as she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997), and TV shows like "I Saw What You Did" (1988) & " The children of Stepford "(1987). Although he does not have much to do in this movie. Skippable, but observable, in any case.
