Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She needs to be the center of attention and will act stupidly to make it so. With their attitude, they send her to the school of charm. <br /> <br /> There he meets the typical characters of the current cinema; The nerd, the clumsy, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and in the end Adela "learns her lesson", so to speak. The plot tries to take a deeper meaning to the state in which Adela is, but fails completely (at least I did not buy it). So, what you have left is the superficial interaction within the same stereotypes that you have seen in a million movies before. In addition, the director seems to have a fixation on the breasts, Adela shows her tits several times, at least I do not see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is fine, but if you're like me and you do not like to see a teenager get angry at people and make a behavior change in an instant, which I thought was incredible, think twice times before looking.
