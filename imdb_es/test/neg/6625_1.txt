This is what they came up with for the first feature film by comedian Prop Carrot Top. <br /> <br /> A stupid surfer (carrot character) inherits a research and development company from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things are not going so bad, but they get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate robbers. The most unlikely of this movie is that Courtney Thorne-Smith, a smart girl, would find this red-haired step-daughter fascinating in the least (but simply inherited millions). The "classic" moments include comedian Larry Miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try the funny humor of the UN toilet, and that's exactly what it belongs: in the toilet ... unload twice.
