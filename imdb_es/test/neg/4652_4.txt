Along with his turn in the super-sordid "classic" "THE TOOLBOX MURDERS" (1978), this is considered the worst horror effort of Cameron Mitchell. He's a little too slow for my taste, he does not have any sympathetic characters and there's not much action to the end, but the dedication of Mitchell's central psychopath as revenge strike work, Vincent Rinard is fun. Anthony Perkins is not good, of course, but he's definitely funny enough. Like a parody of the superficial conceit that is Hollywood, it's just regular; Like horror movie is also fair. And even as a simple vintage exploitation image, it's fine. I am a big fan of the unnecessary free dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the appearance of the Gazzarri dancers, who simply rule. Five of them do a crazy dance routine of go-go with crazy moves, that slide across the floor and shake at the hip for "Do not Cry, Look for the Rainbow" of the T-Bones. Seeing these ladies jump with big smiles on their faces with their fringed bikini top and a set of pants with a parachute is one of the reasons why I give it a slightly higher rating than usual. <br /> <br /> Former film makeup Vincent Rinard ("The best since Lon Chaney!") chases people at Paragon Studios. A flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, threw wine into Vinnie's face just as he was about to light a cigarette. He is engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before healing one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). Now employed by the "world-famous" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, Vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Centrum Care !) To paralyze the victims. They disappear and the dense detectives in the case (led by Scott Brady) act bewildered when new "statues" are displayed in the museum. Vince talks to himself ("I'm a terribly good man!"), Smokes, whispers, whistles and describes how he gets "turned on" by a woman's scream. <br /> <br /> He also has to deal with a handful of self-absorbed squads and witches, most of whom deserve what awaits them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a drunk, inept, museum guide who sees a "statue" blinking, but does not go to the police. Apart from Max (a real Grade-A imbecile ... who does not even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are quite atrocious. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this vagabond has committed himself to no less than five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the wax mannequins / missing male stars (I guess she never had time to prove the only missing girl). For some reason, he also begs and pleads in his irritating baby voice for Vince to give him a "replica" of the head he is designing for the missing new actor (and his fianc√© number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince already put a syringe in the neck, but I love it when Mitchell agrees with his demands "so you can completely retire to reality." He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means that they eventually have her imprisoned in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole through which its head peeks out, so we have to continue to be assaulted by its sharp moans. <br /> <br /> The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the go-go girls mentioned above. She has seen it for the first time, which shows that she is completely deficient in rhythm when she flutters on stage with a lime-green bikini. Theresa is tolerable before speaking, but when you realize that her presence in the grid combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco with the mentality of head of the Landers sisters, you would want Vincent to inject the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, first we are subjected to a scene in which she asks the studio director infinitely and runs through the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely unpleasant, but I guess they work as a way to make fun of the Hollywood system in general. And I'm probably giving this movie more credit than it really deserves. The advantages are few and far between, but include (apart from Mitchell and the dance routine) a colorful and slightly stylized lighting and a strange ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Oh, that's really scary. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast is director John "Bud" Cardos (also production manager) as a police sergeant, James Forrest as a film director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as barman. Many of the people who worked on it (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) also worked on Al Adamson's BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
