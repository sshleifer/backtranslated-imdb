Let's Get Tough is one of those movies that people will probably regret years later than they did. This story of East End Kids, full of terrible talks and jokes about Japanese, details how children want to join the army to defeat the Japanese. Because they are too young, they decide to cleanse the city of those unpleasant Japanese. They find one, they throw fruit (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls out a short sword to threaten them. The cops say stop bothering him! It's only Chinese! He is on our side! When the children come back to apologize, the Chinese is dead! Everything is part of this huge ring of Japanese and German spies! Children make sure that this stops at all costs! I'm sure all this was fine when it was made (1942) but seen now, you realize, of course, that this is clearly a product of your time. Filled with stereotypes, Germans and Japanese. It is curious that East End children have a black child in the group, and it is not free either. Caramba.
