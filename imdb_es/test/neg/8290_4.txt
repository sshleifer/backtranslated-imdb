The "Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday the 13th". Both films deal with bloody and creative murders, rather than suspense. If you like that kind of movie, I recommend "Graduation Day". If not, I would not. There's nothing new here, just the same old murders. <br /> <br /> Although I have given the movie 4 out of 10, I will say it is not a disgusting movie. It's observable if you're curious about it, it's just not creative.
