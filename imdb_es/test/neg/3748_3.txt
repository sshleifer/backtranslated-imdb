First of all, if you want to make a good movie, do not expose all your exposure in the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be baffled for almost two hours, only for Margo's father to explain everything to Alex very late in the film. To make matters worse, the screenwriter decided it was not enough to solve the basic mystery, but adds a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (in relation to Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> There are some serious errors. Motivation problems with the characters too. The election of Margo's father does not seem to make sense once the film ends. Why did not he just kill Philippe's father and end it? Instead, a complicated plot is made to hide the truth, but one that guarantees that everyone will be in physical danger for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who is killed by the thugs of Philippe's father). Although Alex is a doctor (whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but also those involved in an unpleasant stacking on the highway. Why was Margo's friend so interested in keeping her promise to Margo, once all the shit hits the fan for Alex? And should we think that Margo's father would rather commit suicide than go to jail? What's wrong with his wife? Did you consider your wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some unpleasant details, such as: why was your father there the night of his false death? How could he grab the body of the drug addict in such a short time and retrieve it quickly to bury him with the other two? Alex's friend, Bruno, seems to be anxious to be part of the chaos, in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex, despite the debt owed to Alex for saving his son's life. What good would the photos of Margo? They do not involve Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the key to the safe at hand that night for the kidnappers to take? Did I miss some other things? Probably. My minor irritations include the fact that, although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a demon. What makes his marathon run away from the police, even more impressive. Also, when you travel in the convertible with your lawyer, none of them is wearing a seatbelt. How bright could they be?
