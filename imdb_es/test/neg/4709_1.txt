There should be some kind of prosecution to punish the producers for funding this stupid scripts. I feel that some kind of criminalization of a bad movie could prevent more films from being made by this idiot. Of course it has an interesting cast of characters, but I do not think I've ever seen more cardboard performances of a complete cast as in this piece of shit so unique. That director must be punished in some way for not getting at least some kind of performance from these people. So detachment is a theme (no, actually, they will hit you in the head with this), it does not mean that all the characters have to recite their lines as if they were in NPR. Did I mention that this movie was crap? Finally, I'm not sure what connection memories would have to terminal bone cancer, but I'm reasonably sure that if you had a total brain death, your cancer would continue to grow in spite of everything. This movie is an insult for cancer patients, medical professionals and people without delay. Oh, and finally, bumblebees fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by flapping their wings like any other flying insect. Absolutely disdain to people who present false knowledge as a fact. Next time, investigate a little before using an improper imbecile concept of a whole movie. ONLY COLLECTING BELIEVES IN JESUS!
