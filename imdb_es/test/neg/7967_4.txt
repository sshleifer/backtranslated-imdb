This is unique in the Hitchcock films I've seen, because I really did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found this quite predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of "adorable rogue" character you've seen in many movies, never being so kind as far as I'm concerned! <br /> <br /> In fact, it was a hardly credible relationship, and at times it seemed particularly false and implausible. <br /> <br /> Unable to keep a job and try to lead an opulent lifestyle, Grant is taken to request a loan that he can not pay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her to get the money she is insured from; and, presumably, the value of his late father. <br /> <br /> It's actually quite uninteresting, but as usual, you can see the influence on the films that have been presented at a later date.
