The story of "The Stranger" reflects in a way the 1969 film "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (performed by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson of "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999"). A parallel universe Earth is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" presents a totalitarian regime to crush the freedom of citizenship, "Journey to the other side of the Sun" simply showed a true world of mirrors where handwriting, roads, houses, machinery all kinds and of course, the internal organs were all in reverse order (or reflected). Then, the similarity of the Parallel Lands is the only connection of both films. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the television series "The Land of the Giants" came before those two films, having been executed from 1968 to 1970. a world that was almost parallel to Earth, with the Except that the planet was populated by giants 12 times larger than the humans who landed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and contain the "small people" was similar to the premise of "The Stranger" rather than the premise of "JTTFSOTS". Maybe due to the similar to "LOTG", a series of "The Stranger" was filed. If it had turned into a television series, it would have been a science fiction version of "The Fugitive", with the star Glenn Corbett being chased by the bad guys from one week to the next, hiding in different places, etc. By the way, a stronger script could have helped this movie along.
