Great spoiler here: this movie is B! TO! D! But enjoy it, it's good, bad. <br /> <br /> Bugged is the kind of movie you can not believe exists, with dialogue, plot and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern video looks like an IMAX experience. As it is a Troma movie, there is a lot of gore on the tap, but it is even dumber than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the production money seems to have gone towards buying soft drinks and sandwiches for the cast and crew. The brilliant dialogue is best summed up in the immortal, "% @ # $! What was that?" which is surpassed only by the often shouted: "And now what?" <br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to Ronald Armstrong, the writer / director. When it is discovered that one of the friends is eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / chiapet thing, Armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with a cute, but silly latch, "Divine." While they beat her, Divine is cooking a steaming pot with a rat poison / rat oat mixture on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, without falling from the fumes! <br /> <br /> Killer insects are as frightening as pi√±atas, to which they are too similar. The effects used to move them include dragging them across the tile floors very quickly with their legs crawling backwards. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie was probably the explosion of the house, but they ran out of money or I never had any, so instead of seeing even a burning model, they just let the screen turns black (your ILM heart is eaten). <br /> <br /> The cast is practically all black. How can the NAACP systematically censor something really funny like Amos and Andy (which represents characters no less similar than those in 99% of all white comedy shows), but does not say anything about something like Bugged? Oh, well, you better not know how degrading this film is to everyone involved (as it would be if it were performed by just one ethnic group, frankly). Before they put the kabosh in Bugged, gather some friends and get ready for the films of Plan 9 of Bug Exterminator.
