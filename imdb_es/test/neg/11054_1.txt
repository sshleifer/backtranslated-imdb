Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology, so he built a horror movie about a similar cult. The twist is that, instead of the frail old L. Ron Hubbard as cult leader, there is a centennial space monster that turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty-life college student who is investigating the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to cleanse his life with the help of the cult. It does not take him long to realize that he is only behind one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was filmed very cheaply in a video and I just ugly. The space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually crazy and has no skin) is alternately a clay miniature and a large-scale animatronic puppet, both of which look very bad. The acting and writing are terrible and the director does not even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. Avoid this little excuse without fear, regrettable.
