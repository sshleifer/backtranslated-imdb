An unreliable plot, an unreliable script, almost everything ugly. The most convincing performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not rescue this useless and unpleasant film. The implicit invitation of the director to the spectators is not simply to suspend the disbelief, but also to suspend the trial. <br /> <br /> Presumably, his intention is to be hot and threatening, but although the film has its erotic moments, they are few and far between. This kind of thing has been done better by many others. Do not go out of your way to see it.
