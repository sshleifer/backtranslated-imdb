I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his performance is made of wood, he portrays a tough "leader" character. Same here. This film is about a group of young, enthusiastic scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The initial scene was very interesting, with a group of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Let's move forward 30 years and we have a team of divers called by a scientist and his team to explore a cave with some unknown scientific purpose. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of clich√©s, useless conversations. Women are too hot for their jobs, let's be honest. I hate to see the lips of these women talking about the boys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I mean, it was like we were in a bar with fraternity types and brotherhoods talking about the opposite sex, not a group of scientists and divers. All the characters had ZERO personality, perhaps with the exception of the scientist, who at least was not one of the young and beautiful people. Therefore, the performance, although laborious, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was bad enough. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the leading diver, his iris transforms into the wireless symbol of Cingular and stays that way. They make us believe that, since he was scratched by one of these monsters, he is becoming one of them. Fair enough. But first of all, no one tells you the obvious: "What's wrong with your EYES, friend?" No. Everyone just talked about how he "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says: "You see he's not HUMAN." Eh If you really believed that you were a monster, then why not act like that? Instead, the group is divided into two: those who go with Jack and those who take separate paths, I guess he thinks he is a monster. Has no sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie was this blonde diving woman who crawls through a wall in the cave and is attacked by this goblin. His scream really stung, but he fought like hell to dispatch the goblin. <br /> <br /> The picture was fine when the camera STILL. But in any sequence of action, the director found it useful to confuse hell with bubbles, lanterns, dark space, God knows what. I wish we were shown a scene from time to time. The fact that you move the camera all over the place does not make the movie become HIGHER, folks. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if the following changes had been made: <br /> <br /> 1. Each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the leader, it's fine to let him be the handsome one. I'm getting tired of seeing about 20 supermodel scientists. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The director of photography was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and stood still. This could be the director's fault, I do not know. The Jumpy camera (as in Constant Gardener) is aging, friends. <br /> <br /> 3. We were able to see the goblins devouring people. How about a little blood? There is not much else in this movie. We could barely see the creatures, I felt a bit scammed by that. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was quite lame. During the denouement, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what that is? It's a bit canned. The ending would have been better if they all died instead of Black (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to feel a certain sympathy for his character just because of his expressions of concern. All the other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4 out of 10, because after all, the performance was without noticeable errors, and the concept was quite original. I'd like to see Cole do more military functions, he's good at that.
