What has Rajiv Rai done with himself? Once a successful film director like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad movie after another. Initially, I was enthusiastic about the idea of ​​Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre, but that soon faded. As a fan of Rajiv Rai, I thought that I should at least try, but I left after one hour. One of the reasons why I left the film so early, because of the amount of paki that hits the film, this was not in Rai's previous company. <br /> <br /> Many directors have tried it, but I did not expect from Rajiv Rai Another disappointment was the music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music so far. There is only one good song and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to scratch, not even from Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Avoidable rate of once my favorite director.
