The initial scene of the beach in Fircombe, although fun in itself, unfortunately provides an adequate metaphor for the film: tasteless and washed. Actually, it's not as cheesy as most of the others in the Carry On series, but maybe because of that it's not really fun. It is a fair bet that the title is attractive to fans of the Benny Hill show, but those who look for attractive women in bikinis and miniskirts, although they will see some in this, will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series, such as Continue in the "Foreigner" or "Continue in the jungle." The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a plot device that seems quite counterproductive.
