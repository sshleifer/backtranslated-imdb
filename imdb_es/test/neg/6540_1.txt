"The Puffy Chair" was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life that can not be recovered and spent in a more valuable way (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a better use of the precious moments of life). It should be called "The swollen chair" because only the "swollen" chairs could accommodate the extremely "bloated", self-important siblings who drooled for public consumption; and, obviously, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed that the public would really want to consume their slime. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" look like a cinematic masterpiece. "Valley of the Dolls", "Beyond Valley of the Dolls", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob", all this being a better use of his time, what to see "The swollen chair". The portrayed characters are too predictable or lack normal emotional reflexes, even to approach being sympathetic or credible. Also, at one point in the movie, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if you look closely, you can see that one part of the city is apparently in the south of the United States, and the other Half is located in Maine. That's a town, huh?
