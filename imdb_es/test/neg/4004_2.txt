This film is included along with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired in terms of their impressions on DVD. First, both films are very dark, which sometimes makes it difficult to see exactly what is happening. Secondly, none of the films have subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie, although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dubbing. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for those who are not purists, this is not a problem. However, these DVD problems are not the fault of the original filmmakers, only the indifferent package that is commercialized four decades later. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a major problem, since Van Johnson looks as much like Garfield as Judy Garland. In no way does it look like Garfield. He's missing his beard, he's got the wrong hair color and style, and he's not even close in any way (trust me, I'm a professor of American history and we're paid to know this kind of thing!). Garfield's real life was a Civil War general and he looked like the guys in the Smith Brothers cough boxes. Also, using some other actor to provide Johnson's voice in the voiceover is simply surreal. Never before or since then Van Johnson has sounded so macho! He was a good actor ... but he was certainly not a convincing general or a macho president. <br /> <br /> Besides the stupid casting, the death of President Garfield did not look anything like this movie. It is obvious that the filmmakers are really taking advantage of the crazy speculation about conspiracies related to the death of JFK, not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a lone gunman with serious mental problems, not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (more than two months later) were incompetent doctors, who investigated and probed and searched for a bullet (unsuccessfully) and never bothered to wipe their hands or implements in the process. In other words, like George Washington (who was killed basically by repeated bleeding when he suffered from pneumonia) died due to bad practice. In the film they did not get anything at all ... apart from that, indeed, President Garfield was shot. <br /> <br /> Because the movie has almost no similarity to the real story, it's like a history lesson as taught by someone from another planet. or someone with a serious brain injury. Why not include ninjas, combat robots and the Greek gods while you're at it?!?! Apart from some decent acting and production values, because the script is a cow shit, I do not recommend anyone to see it. It's just a complete and complete disaster.
