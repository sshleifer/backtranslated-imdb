I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and I really could not understand those who did not like it. But I can not defend this nonsense. The spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: <br /> <br /> So, if Starbuck thinks he knows where the Earth is, do not send it. Out in a raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third officer with more experience? Would the Quorum choose its new member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust. Would Adama send Gaeta and Halo along with Starbuck, staying out of the top officers? Would Adama put a man in sexual relations with Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I just do not buy any of this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, although I accept that I have had miracles and references to God until the end of Season 3, now everything is totally exaggerated. I started seeing BG because I thought it was science fiction, not a biblical epic. I expected the characters to behave reasonably intelligently, and I wanted some satisfactory explanations about some of the weirder developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the show, but now he seems to be totally crazy. It is not illogical considering what has happened, but it is very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to be just puppets dancing at the behest of an unknown third party (a divine entity). This is not a good drama, it's annoying and a writing mistake. <br /> <br /> Well, what are the good points? Nice battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well acted) when seen in isolation. A good final scene, a beautiful hanging curve ball of a development. <br /> <br /> But this is not science fiction, it became fantasy. I can not imagine how writers can recover this.
