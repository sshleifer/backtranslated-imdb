I absolutely hated this movie. Although the film wanted to convey some kind of social message, it was made in a clich√© and melodramatic way like a Mexican telenovela. <br /> <br /> The acting was also terrible, especially Charityn and her son. That is one of the problems with Dominican films: they use celebrities that can not even act to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more embarrassed by the positive reviews that, unfortunately, mean that Dominicans are only being patronizing with what is done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry to be based in quality
