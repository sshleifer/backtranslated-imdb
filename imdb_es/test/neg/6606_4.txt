A very mediocre movie based on a magnificent series of stories and novels. I hope someone, someday, can film it in the right way. Meanwhile, look for the books (by A. Sapkowski), a very intelligent and postmodern fantasy. For now there should be a translation in English, surely there are translations in German.
