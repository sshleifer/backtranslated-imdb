No no no. That is my advice to you if you want to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is the only and ONLY Norman Bates, as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This looks like a colored version of Psycho, with some slightly different touches for more modern appeal. Vaughn is bored as Norman is sick, and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too cowboy compared to the original. Please friends, do some justice. Do not bother with this. One can only wonder what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins would think at this time ....... <br /> <br /> * of ****
