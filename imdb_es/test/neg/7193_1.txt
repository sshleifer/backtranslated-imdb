Well, do not bother. This movie looks so tired, the acting is so old-fashioned, and the plot and the characters so monotonous, they should be studied instead of seen. It is really a horrible waste of film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, meaningless, and amateur cinematography. I saw him with incredible amazement with his mouth open. How could a movie like that be made? And, what is more interesting, how could someone find it funny or visible? Old, tired, careless ... a high school sketch, at best. There is nothing visible there, except for a study of a very old movie. It's not a good movie, just old. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. This makes no sense. The acting is so bad that maybe it's worth looking only for laughter. Some movies are so bad that they are good. But, this goes around the corner and returns to evil again.
