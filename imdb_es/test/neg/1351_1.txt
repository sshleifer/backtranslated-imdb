I really wish I had read everyone's review before going to see the movie ... it was one of the most unbearable movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater at 5 minutes from the movie; I should have followed my instinct. The film did not offer anything new or intelligent, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to discover that it was run by a woman! The characters did not represent any woman I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, bad makeup and hairstyle. Recently it was compared with the movie Sex and in the City; It was not even half as good. My suggestion, do not watch this movie!
