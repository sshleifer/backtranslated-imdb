I only saw the first part of this and I came to the conclusion that I would not miss anything if I did not see the second episode. The cinematography was fine, but apart from this, the plot was as common and common as any other war story. The actors and actresses play their characters without any passion, and the makeup is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger respectively, as if a dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if he's seen more than two or three movies about World War II (like most of us), he would only take the trouble to see a third or fourth if he promises some new ideas or twists in the plot. But Roland Suso Richter seems afraid to do it, you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejun expectations of the conservative TV channel ZDF while watching this movie. Millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative German cinema. These millions of dollars could have been spent making three or four independent films, but no, let's give something to a director who will make a movie that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what the war is like! Or give me a million euros and I make a better movie than this load of BS! And another thing: why are German films only nominated for the Oscars when the film is about the Second World War or the Holocaust? Probably because that is the only thing that German cinema does well. And that should make us think, is not it?
