Lance Henriksen was paid something to appear in this. I hope it has been a lot. <br /> <br /> The former gymnast of the US National Champion UU., Kristie Phillips, starts as Charlie Case, a secret gymnast's agent (because it's very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) <br /> <br /> There is a truly hysterical opening scene in which the routine of irregular bars of Charlie is sabotaged by a competitor of the Eastern block. What follows is one of the most ridiculous action scenes I have witnessed ... and they want you to take it seriously! Do not worry ... she takes over your disassembly. <br /> <br /> Everything after that is just a messy spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes for country gymnastics, then run to cover yourself.
