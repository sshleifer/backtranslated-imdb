I felt compelled to write about this film after joining IMDb because I thought it was the worst script I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting / direction / other areas of the film are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. Works. The witty jokes were still there too from the first movie. My question is, how in the world did you leave this script out of the writing process? I thought that not only the plot developed like a slug that ran to the end of the sidewalk, but that turn? (Can I call it that?) It was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go and ask for a refund from the box office. I had never felt so played and used in a movie in my entire life. Here I expected something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to discover that they had taken my $ 8 and mocked her. <br /> <br /> The part that reassures me is that this movie has now raised more than 125 million dollars. <br /> <br /> In short, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel that the only part that the writers focused on was a bit with Julia Roberts acting as Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
