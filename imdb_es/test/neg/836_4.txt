Without a doubt, the least I've seen among the Spaghetti Westerns lately: basically a Leone scam THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three different characters that make fun of each other (and sometimes form unstable alliances) in his search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin called it a PUMP; although it is quite harmless, it is also totally routine and, fatally, the three main roles are the stereotypes, that is, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is an employee of the bank with ideas about his shipment by train; Gilbert Roland is the "legendary" Mexican bandit but he is getting older (his frequent lapses in Spanish when they are excited are pretty cheesy!) That, apparently, is still irresistible for women; George Hilton, as an enigmatic bounty hunter, tries too hard to emulate Clint Eastwood's nameless Man. The director Castellari, whom I saw in the retrospective of the Italian film film held during the Venice Film Festival in 2004, where he became the most pompous cult film director of all! - shows little genuine feeling for the Western style (thanks to two efforts of Franco Nero above the average in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... Now I'm crossing my fingers!) and the film Irony Focus is equally unfortunate.
