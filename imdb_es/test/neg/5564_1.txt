I hate this movie! I have never seen so much complete junk in my life! I live in France, so it turned out that I was in the front line to see this horrible movie. At first, it looked great, something like something about a cursed forest that bites people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something VERY different: a good start with a girl who knows a boy and everything else, then the girl receives threatening messages in the form of crows locked in her bathroom closet (ridiculous), from that moment and thereafter, the film begins to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate movements in the process. The film ends with druids in abundance and ugly and stinky old creatures that return from the past to kill a few people. By then, many questions were rushing around my head: why the hell did they bring that fake monster? Do the druids look like maniacs dressed in sheets? Why did they bother to make this movie? The "climax" of the film was so ridiculous that I laughed the whole time: the "horrible" stinking monster wrestles with the two young women (who seem to be masters of kung fu) and the teacher is cut in two or something. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and lanky in battle, was not it supposed to be a war god or something? Anyway, the movie in his death shots was a sad sight. A brief condensation of the content of this film: Kung fu mayhem + druid stones + mysterious murders "Ã  la thriller" + ancient prophecies + crows in poor condition + ancient awkward god of war without bones + mad professor = complete and absolute, sick, without bones, eaten worm! Things I learned from this movie: -The gods of ancient war are evil in kung fu . -All young women who study archeology at university in France are experts in kung fu. - The teachers are so resistant that they can survive if they are cut in two by a saw-what-chamacallita without injuries.
