By all appearances, this series could have been done at any time since the mid-forties. The cardboard games, the kings of the moon with lightning stitched on their aprons, you know the drill. This is an adventure of Rocky Jones, which presents the space police with the unbearable Bitch Queen of the planet Offeecious, a communist planet that will not join United Planets. When the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is on course to collide with this other vaguely Slavic planet, Queen Bitch decides to fly the other types instead of evacuating her land. This introduces a moral in the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in its land, but in its people," which is hinted five or six times in the festival of conversation. BQ's constant nasal rant over "OffEEEEcious" provides relief to some spatial effects that are really wanted, is this a television show?
