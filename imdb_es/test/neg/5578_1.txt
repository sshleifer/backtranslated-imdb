Predator Island begins with six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend some time in Kevin (Michael Wrann) ) Father's boat party in the open sea. What could go wrong with such a great idea? Well, to begin with, a large green meteorite could crash into the sea near your ship and an extraterrestrial life force could emerge from it and try to kill them all, then, again, that's just a ridiculously stupid idea, is not it ? <Br /> <br /> Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was crap and it's really simple and straightforward. The script is the worst kind, you know the kind of abomination that is full of very annoying teenage characters who do and say the stupidest things, they are full of clich√©s and they are completely predictable, it does not make any sense, things just suddenly, without accumulation or explanation, it is boring even at just 70 odd minutes and has virtually no entertainment value, not even the value of involuntary laughter. The film really does not have much of what I would call a plot, no explanation is given as to why or how this alien creature can take over the minds of people or why it can be selective in the sense that in a moment the person will be "the normal thing is the following, when history requires it and without apparent cause, suddenly they turn green and have a sudden impulse to become cannibal." There is not enough horror in it, the so-called scenes of action are lamentable and I really do not want to waste another second thinking about Predator Island and much less wasting my precious energy writing these words ... <br /> <br /> Director Castle does nothing to make this visible and the "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this kind of alien creature would not even get into a 50s science fiction movie. The filmmakers even reproduce some false images in the credits. Inal, but this has to be the funniest collection of mistakes of all, I mean you can not even make mistakes if you know what I mean. Forget about any decent gore since there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and some intestines placed in the stomach of unfortunate actors so that another unfortunate actor can pick them up and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 150,000 I have to admit that the filmmakers were working with a very low budget, that's not an excuse to make a film so poor. Everything seems very cheap and the acting is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is a crap, I'm sorry, but that's how it is and I just do not see what would come out. In my humble opinion, this is probably one to avoid.
