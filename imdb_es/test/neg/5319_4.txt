Peter Hunt started out as a very talented film editor and got his first directing opportunity when he directed the James Bond movie "In His Majesty Secret Service" (considered by many Bond fans to be the best in the series). Other titles in his filmography include epic-scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil," both adapted from Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is strange in his movie list; It seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and experience chooses to direct a film of this kind. A half-life / half-animated action from Jonathan Swift's classic satire, the film looked obsolete even when it was made, and in all honesty it just does not work. And there's no damn thing that Hunt (with his usual eye for accelerated action), or the star Richard Harris (who can normally animate the most forced roles) can do to rescue this one. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in the 17th century in Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to make his fortune; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving a fairly lower salary, but a lot more adventures as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called 'Antelope'. During a trip, the 'Antelope' veers off course during a storm and hits a reef. The ship sinks and all are lost, apart from Gulliver ?? which is washed ashore in the kingdom of Lilliput. As he approaches, Gulliver discovers that the strange land where he has washed on the coast is populated by incredibly small humans, no taller than his toe. For them, it looks like a giant. They persuade Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver does not like to be manipulated for war and devastation purposes, so he makes plans to escape. <br /> <br /> Harris is allowed to take the whole movie here. His first couple of scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the film walking on his knees and performing with his animated counterparts. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but certainly not much had been done. Some Disney movies such as Song Of The South, So Dear To My Heart and Pete's Dragon had manipulated the idea, but it was still in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly animated movie, but the scenes that show the interaction between Harris and his fellow cartoonists are performed at least competently. Occasionally, the film tries to be true to its satirical origins (there is a scene in which we learn that Lilliput has gone to war with his neighbor for the eggs.). But deep down, this is very much a children's movie and the satirical nuances just run out. Did everyone involved have done better things during their career? "Gulliver's trips" could fill an empty afternoon, but other than that, it's a forgettable and disappointing experience.
