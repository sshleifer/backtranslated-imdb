The title of this review summarizes how I feel about this movie. I can not imagine what audience there would be for this, if it were not for the fanatic of the movie fans of the 80s who simply have to do - all that - of that time. Otherwise, do not even waste your time on this. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most movies of its kind: something terrible happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty murderer to go on a rampage assassin. I've been there, done that. In fact, none of these 80's slasher was known for their originality, so I can not see the point of insisting on the movie simply because of this. <br /> <br /> But where the film fails, it is in suspense. and sequences of murders. I've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had much lower budgets than this. He simply can not create any real suspense. The director presents some nice camera angles and some semi-professional direction touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not scared. The gore is also quite docile, so anyone who sees these things with the intention of seeing some great makeup effects of the 1980s will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film manages to endure quite properly. Honestly, the key ingredient for almost any slasher is the tight rhythm: you have to keep things moving fast and let the killings take place at regular intervals, because, let's be honest, we do not look at these things for big characterizations and stellar plots. But the rhythm, either due to the script or the editor, is off. The murders are spaced at odd intervals, which leaves us with some very breathtaking scenes (no doubt, designed to build a "character") that only serve to bore you and leave you praying for the next death (which, as I said, Anyway, it usually does not perform as well). <br /> <br /> As for the killer, do not expect anything original or even remotely terrifying. He (or she?) Wears a running suit, a fencing mask and his main weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just thought that he came up with an original and "cool" murder weapon, but the idea becomes impractical and silly. Nor is much emphasis placed on the nature of "whodunnit" of the film, as if they had forgotten or did not care to put any false trail in the mix to say goodbye. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that the people behind this were trying to do something decent and respectable, and on occasion, it shows that their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film, in opposition to countless other imitation slashers of the time. The attempt fails for the most part. However, there is a good performance (at least, for this type of movie). There is an attempt at characterization, but none of them means anything at the end, so ... Here, all he manages to do is get stuck in the plot and make the sequences of murders feel like they can not get there soon enough. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you really like this Of course, take a look at the old '80s, if only to say you've seen it. There is a complete in all of us. But do not expect to be surprised. or something. What we have here is a very entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression.
