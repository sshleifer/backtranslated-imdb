Can not liberals like Alec Baldwin understand that they lost the 2000 and 2004 elections? The ridiculous the lame bruises at WalMart, the non-union workers, George W. Bush and the stock exchange, not to mention the intentional accent of GWB that Balwin's character uses in the movie alone make him look silly and bitter on the screen. As the credits accumulate, the sour grapes continue as Ken Lay and other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone receive "Special Thanks." Let me tell you something: if you invest all your money in shares of a company, YOU ARE AN IDIOT. We do not need this excuse for a movie to tell us that. What a waste of the talent of Jim Carrey, of the trailer. I expected a completely different movie. What I got was a 90-minute DNC commercial about how to scare people so they do not invest in their own future, keep them stupid and keep them dependent on the government. I'm not surprised that Hollywood is in trouble and can no longer make a decent movie; maybe you can have an original idea and put it on the screen for once ... although I should not be surprised since Jane Fonda was chosen in the original.
