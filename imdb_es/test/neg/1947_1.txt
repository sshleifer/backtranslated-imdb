This is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring and there is no sex scene. In addition, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal, which makes it extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but they only have one kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger who pick up from the high road. The couple invites the stranger to stay with them, because they have no home. At this point, you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife, right? No, they just kiss and that's it. In addition, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, not even suspense. It makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script !!!!
