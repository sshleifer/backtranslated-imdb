"The Brotherhood of Satan" is an amazing combination of conventional horror elements mixed with an imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with Father Charles Bateman (like Ben) driving west with his beautiful blondes: Ahna Capri (as Nicky), and his daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get rarer for the trio, as they approach the city of Hillsboro, which is being trapped by a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> When boring travelers hit Hillsboro, the "action" changes to the most interesting set of characters in the movie: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete, the sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, the priest), and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). His game is sometimes fun. Very soon, everything becomes very foolish and predictable. Mr. Martin is the outstanding one (as one might expect); considers that the possibility of a satanic cult is a "history of roosters and bulls", but it is (of course) its leader. The end of "Come in, kids" is disconcerting; Unless, maybe, it was the original title of the movie.
