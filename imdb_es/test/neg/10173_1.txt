As you can read, the only good comment about this movie was made by someone who really saw it AT HIS CHURCH! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a good start to science fiction movie B, everything was there to make a good movie entertaining and easy to see, then everything felt in this brainwashing mode religious of Jesus to save everyone. <br /> <br /> the story begins with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but they quickly give the first role to that monster of Jesus that is there to save the soul of all with this concommitant attitude. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie goes from entertainment to brainwashing in about 30 minutes <br /> <br /> A waste of time, a waste of money ... AVOID IT
