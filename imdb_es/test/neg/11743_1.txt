A horrendous, ill-conceived and raw movie. The performance of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version as to see them believe. There was no reason to make this image, which only highlights how successful and brilliant Hitchcock was and the inimitable. In addition, there is a drag and generalized insensitivity in the film that does not appear in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was terrifying and shocking, but one could really feel it for everyone involved, even the unfortunate Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and false humor that the remake does not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of when to cut and when to show something, whether to use a close-up or a remote possibility, whether to make an actor sympathetic and understanding. when to make it scare, and so on. The remake does not have any of these qualities and does not even try. It's an idiotic exercise that surprises me, even freed me.
