According to the budget information provided on this website, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money was spent I'm not exactly sure. Let me see ... costumes ... no ... location and sets ... mmm, do not think about it ... f / x special ... NO ... acting lessons ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend tells him to take his friends there to see the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great-grandfather used a unique method to grow his crops and now is the time for revenge. Scarecrow killer to get revenge! Ewww is scary. Well no, not really. We all know that there have been some great movies made with very little money, but this is not one of them. This movie contains practically one of the worst performances and dialogues I've seen. Terrible clich√©s with terrible delivery. In general, do not be fooled by the average decent coverage and avoid at all costs. I'd like to give the filmmakers at least one D for trying, but I'm afraid they did not even do a good job with that. GRADE: F
