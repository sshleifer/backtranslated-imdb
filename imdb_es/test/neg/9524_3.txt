AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 within 2.39: 1 frame (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978 : A working The adolescent of class (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and faces high society, where he learns hard lessons about the divisions between rich and poor. <br /> <br /> Director Duncan Roy's autobiographical feature (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an exposition of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a lowly "plebeian" rent whose vision of the world is transformed into his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy's script says very little that we did not know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly lit by Leitch's relationship with an attractive but self-destructive boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the same people you're looking to emulate. Also starring Diana Quick (as a scandalous snob who believes that the working class is "ashamed to be alive"!), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT) FOR THE CHILD) and Georgina Hale in a typically extravagant cameo, showing her tits spontaneously, without any worries in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by Roy's insistence on using a triptych effect (three separate images of 1.78: 1 are in letterbox format within the 2.39: 1 frame, each of which provides a different point of view of individual scenes), which reduces the image and moves viewers away from on-screen events. A long film, meaningless, too personal for a great attraction, and hindered by a film process that fails to reconcile the story in question. A one-image version (theatrically framed at 1.85: 1) is also available, with the title on screen AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.
