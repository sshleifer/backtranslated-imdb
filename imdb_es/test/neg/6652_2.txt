I can not believe I've seen this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" in which I kept waiting for him to improve, which never happened. The sound is terrible, going from too low to hear the conversations, to a shrill sound in seconds. The plot is absolutely implausible, the performance is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being pigeonholed in that role could certainly be considered negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medicines, science or anything of a technical nature. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they came up with that diagnosis. There are so many mistakes, nonsense and things wrong with this movie that if one lists all of them, it would possibly establish some kind of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? A motorcyclist on the highway with a non-DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco??? The paper walls move when they touch, the helmets simply appear out of the air, the guns point in one direction but hit the other, the lighting appears and disappears and there is hardly a scene in motion that does not contain some kind of error . My wife, who is RN in an oncology unit, finally left the room before the end of the movie, so upset by all the medical mistakes. I gave him a 2 only for the performance of Keaton, otherwise, I would surely have obtained a 1.
