I would have more excitement cutting his testicles than seeing this, clearly a trick to rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent", which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> This is a total robbery of "The Core" and much, much worse in terms of special effects, could do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of aluminum foil, I mean Come on ... that "Mole" thing, it had more like a vibrating dildo than an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it; if you do, you will find that the room you are in has a strange smell during the following days and you will have an annoying feeling. in the back of your head you should kill yourself or something like that.
