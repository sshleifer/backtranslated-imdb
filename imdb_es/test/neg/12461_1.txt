For the first time in the movie review, I found myself immediately without interest in this story. I do not know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt insipid, overused and completely original. In the first thirty minutes, I found myself quite apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was not providing anything new to surprise me. After thinking that it could be my mood, I stopped the film and decided to start again in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. I just did not care. That is not a good sign. The characters were bland. When I say soso, I literally mean that when you see them develop, you will never have a taste that reaches your palate. The story seemed recycled, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now, I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she did not add anything new to the prospect. The cast was horrible, the symbolism and the underlying themes were lost until the moment that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and neglected. You did not know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of insisting more on the characters, we found drugs, unimportant sex and money in our faces. These are themes we've seen in all the movies since the dawn of the movie's time, but somehow they could not be captured creatively by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What got me away from this story right away? They were mainly the characters. I have seen most of the work of Brad Renfro and, honestly, he needs to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined it, and strangely can not get out of that stereotyped character. Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I got bored. He knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular or impressive, just repetitive. He needed to bring some emotion or suspense to his role, instead of simply interpreting this random socialite. Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes as a disappointment. Renfro did not show the best of his abilities in this movie. While I'm in the subject ?? No one showed the best of their abilities. What is happening with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I do not think that she really has emerged as an actress, and following roles like Cat Storm does not help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I witnessed who tried to bring something extraordinary to the screen, which, unfortunately, due to the horrible performance of everyone else, was lost. To wander here and there, and honestly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a useless cast and most of the budget for this movie probably went to the TWO scenes she was in. Maybe the rest was for the random kid from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to get away from this. draft. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, apart from acting, was the rhythm of this movie. Nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing came together. There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no real substance was formed. Thefts, the "anguish and anguish" of teenagers, the rich addicts to society who learn how horrible real life is, the random kid from Kids in the Hall, and even the end they felt rushed and horribly edited together. With this poor quality craftsmanship, the whole story never formed any true form. The family structures were never defined, the characters were never given any emotion, and all we have left are bits and pieces of honest leftovers. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. <br /> <br /> While I hate to put all the burden on the director, with this movie I have no other choice. With a horrible title that just shouted the opposite of what was this film, with an ability of amateur direction, the cast was able to give every emotion in each scene, leaving us with an unpleasant performance and poor developments, and with vague narrations is Difficult to place any "good" behind Tart. This was a movie I had not heard anything about, and after watching it, I can see why. All Wayne has done with this movie is to randomly extract excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the previous elements and cutting them all together to make the movie Cake. It's hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this movie. While I do not think there's much to be drawn from the story, all the remaining elements of emotion were exhausted when Wayne took the helm. While most of the time you can accredit part of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even music, in Tart you can not credit anything. From the initial sequence to the end, I felt I was swimming through a very lumpy oatmeal. Without consistency, without strength. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a waste of time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some joke in our society, you will not find it in this movie. Although I know that was what Wayne was trying to show, the final product looks like it was edited in an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing movie to sit on and not encourage anyone to pick it up. Wayne tossed all the teachings of his education at Columbia University to the wind and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of *****
