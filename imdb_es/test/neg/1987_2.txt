This film tries to be artistic, but it is as childish as the first attempt of a student in a film school. Then try to be erotic, but it is as clumsy as the first attempt of a virgin. Finally, try to be cruel and exciting, but apart from Kinski's performance, which is powerful but visibly out of place in the midst of amateur melodrama, it's just as exciting as your hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering the little erotic). this movie is). It presents a scene of blowjobs that is even slower than the performance of ChloÃ« Sevigny in The Brown Bunny. Run away while you have the opportunity. Look for a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog: it's more artistic And more erotic than this gut.
