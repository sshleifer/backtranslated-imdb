I'll be honest and say I gave up seeing it somewhere in the middle of the road and then move on with a few breaks. then I came back here and read many of the criticisms already made ... <br /> <br /> maybe it's just me, and I can not help it, but this caricature for American society seems to have a purpose "let's save them from themselves "And iraq comes to mind immediately. It seems to me that this is a justification, or a part of, for another invasion with "good intentions". <br /> <br /> The lady seems to me a self-congratulatory person and frankly I got angry for her portrait of trying. To pity and "feel" for her. Well, in this case, this could never happen because, just as a history teacher already mentioned here, I NEED to know why your family was so rich above average, I can keep that (were you playing on both sides perhaps?) And send it to Paris !? Now, if this had been done after the biography of a poor girl, I could see myself having certain emotions. but as it is now + its release time is just a pure propaganda movie; Worse still, because of his caricature, he too far exceeds the "soft" side of Tings for his own good, to possibly be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> in addition to those clich√©s regarding gays. Well, a woman who struggles to earn her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdog of society like her? the message is obviously self-indulgent from the point of view of a member of the ruling class. <br /> <br /> I only give it 2 stars because of its production and related things. A propaganda film, obviously, has an interest in convincing and manipulating my thoughts and, therefore, in general it is well made to attract certain visual emotions that I can not deny that I could have too.
