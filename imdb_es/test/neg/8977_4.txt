Deep Sea 3D is a surprising vision of an underwater world that only a few have had the opportunity to see first-hand. <br /> <br /> From the opening sequence, when a wave rushes towards the audience that momentarily envelopes us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A field of jellyfish seems to fill the entire theater, a shark takes over, predators jump from behind the rocks and devour their prey. It is a feast beautifully captured in the sea for the eyes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our ears do not receive the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so ridiculous that they positively spoil the enjoyment of the visual. Depp sounds a bit bored, while Winslet sounds like she's reading a story to sleep the town idiot. I was surprised that an actress from her state could have thrown her performance so badly. The script is quite silly and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange and unreal sound effects that I suppose are fun, but actually divert attention from the material that should have allowed to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has provided an excellent score that quite impacts the ups and downs of life under the sea, when you can play without the foolish sounds of bubbles or the crawling crayfish footsteps. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical marvel, but with a children's script, an annoying narrative and misplaced sound effects, it can not be taken seriously.
