The "Head" of Monkees is one of those peculiar phenomena that I have noticed: that when something does not make sense, people will try to read things and give it great deep meanings, which its creator never intended. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The movie is a stream of consciousness show from The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, scenarios, etc. similar to those of your television program. . But while the television program was played for laughter, this does not seem to reproduce at all except for a kind of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that imposes this mark of psychedelia. All in all, it is The Monkees doing the same, but now it is "awareness" because the track of laughter is eliminated. There is no point of humor or meaning for the whole thing; it simply lights up with colored lights. <br /> <br /> The music in "Head" should prove to anyone, beyond any doubt, that the Monkees did not have a shred of ability to compose songs. The melodies are mostly garbage; The only one that is even listenable is "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the movie. But the point is that this was a song by Gerry Goffin-Carole King and, although it is above average for the Monkees, it is below average by the standards of Goffin and King. It's like listening to one of Peter And Gordon's old songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you find out who wrote it and you realize it's a throwaway. The song of Mike Nesmith is perhaps passable, the rest is worth nothing. Davy Jones has, I suppose, what the filmmakers imagined was "the big number" in the picture, since it is the only song presented as As Show Biz and it is not cut in a film montage or sequence of dreams, but it is also deflates. Because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I always liked the Monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. Sure, they were cheesy, but they were very happy about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were corny and they agreed with that. But then they became ambitious. In "Head," they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is that they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and be taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something comes close to that. "Head" proves that they failed in all aspects. 1 * of 4
