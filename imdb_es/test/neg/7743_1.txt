And the title says it all: a title that sounds corny that is a joke from a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why not call it "Alien of South Africa", since this is the place where this movie was filmed? My advice for watching movies that have been featured in "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" do not look at the original version of the movie at all! Period! Always watch the movie with the shadow of the theater at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two funny and intelligent robot friends sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It just seems better like that. <br /> <br /> Movie as it was originally seen: Great! Movie as it was seen in MST3K: Genius!
