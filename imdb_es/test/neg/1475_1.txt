This was a horrible, boring movie, even for a documentary. Sometimes, it provided a vision of life and also had comical moments, but in general it was not worth seeing. Every time I began to feel sympathy for Mark and hoped he would succeed, I would be disappointed by his lack of responsibility and the abuse of drugs and alcohol.
