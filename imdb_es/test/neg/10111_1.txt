Where the hell do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? First, the script is one of the worst that has appeared on a movie or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King scam. At one point, the supposedly fearsome dark hunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man she is chasing, is as annoying as "a pickle in a hamburger." I would laugh if I was inventing it, BUT I AM NOT! Equally ridiculous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. She was given a cat when she held him during a car accident she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br/> <br/> Second, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat at all. This can not be helped by the fact that all the action occurs during daylight and broad. Not very atmospheric at all. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the acting is really horrible, Piñón proves once again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely credible. Jeff Fahey is obviously on autopilot, but how can you blame him while running through an imitation of Humphry Bogart as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We understand that it's not funny). The credit must go to Susan Paterno, an actress of whom she had no knowledge, does everything she can with the terrible part she has and shames the other more experienced actors. <br /> <br /> At no time is it even explained how the HUMAN character can understand what the character of Van Husen is telling him. She obviously has some kind of title in strange languages. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, one moment is well done, the car accident involving Susan. The sfx are totally credible and if it were not for the hilarious plot of the story, this would have been applauded. <br /> <br /> All I can say about the Dark Hunters is that the British horror will never recover from its endless collapse if films like this continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague would be much more terrifying. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. Suggestions in other reviews that the film is still too smart for some are honestly fun. It is a weak defense when some say that "you did not like it because you did not understand it". The letters that carry my name deceive me, not me.
