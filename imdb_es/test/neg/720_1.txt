This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo work, but in my humble opinion, a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters to begin with. It makes Miranda look crazy after being stuck on the island for so long, Prospero is no different, a mixture of madness and self-pity on his part. I could not imagine Shakespeare thinking that his characters resembled the way Jarman portrays them. <br /> <br /> Caliban's appearance is perhaps the only thing that happened, but again, he had the impression that Caliban was a tormented and deformed monster, but it turns out to be a street demented, northern who is constantly laughing, not as I would have imagined it. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance, naked most of the time and quiet. <br /> <br /> In fact, to the point where I stopped seeing this horrible adaptation, there had been so many lines cut from the work. In any case, I think Jarman was trying to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes most of the time. Both the text that is cut out in the first part does not turn it into a Shakespeare play, but into a melodramatic and absurd charge of the 70s. <br /> <br /> An attempt to interpret this work more realistically in the end , but this game was never realistic and was not done as the text shows.
