The imagination was due to the mind of Jim Wynorski when he wrote the script for this one. I do not care when the animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat lines from other movies they go too far. I enjoyed seeing how they ate Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert. Gloria does not bring anything to the movie, except her tits (the feelings of my husbands). Jerri Manthey should have stayed on the island of survival, her performance is rigid, incredible and she's just a mockery. I liked the scene in which the cobra that comes out of the ocean eats the man and then the added flavor destroys the dreary one. At least we know that the next plot of the giant snake man kills Komodo before he becomes a dad in a nest of eggs. Jerri would be great as the cobra mother. Sit with a 6 pact or a couple of joints. will relieve the pain
