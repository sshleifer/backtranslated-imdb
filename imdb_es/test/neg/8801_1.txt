I do not understand how some people can stand playing "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooter games available. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that does not use any imaginative idea in its armament. All the weapons in the game are real-life weapons, but there could have been at least one trick that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, such as the almighty BFG in Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player really has to reload the weapon manually. This can become extremely annoying, especially when you are in the middle of a gunfight when you are so close to killing the enemy. The delay in recharging also gives the feeling that the weapon is slow to perform its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many character options to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are 4 types of characters for terrorist and anti-terrorist forces. This means that many of the characters look the same, which really reduces the realism of the game. <br /> <br /> The game is quite sexist when it comes to character selections. In the first version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose from (in the Terrorist Force selection) that was good for the players. In the latest versions, however, the female character was eliminated and replaced by another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed with the newer versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the maps in the game are very small. The largest map seems to be the desert map, but it has standard details. In fact, all the maps in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> In summary, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most imaginative first-person shooter of all time. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste time in this boring game? You'd better play the Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this overrated and overrated game. <br /> <br /> I give the game a 1/10.
