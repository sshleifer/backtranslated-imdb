This movie reminds me of the old B movies, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it was going to be a parody of one of those early SF movies. The terrible performance, the plastic accessories and the remarkable visual effects gave me that impression. <br /> <br /> But no, the movie is really that bad. The story is complete nonsense, the effects are below the level of a TV production; Even editing is a disaster. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, although I was pretty sure it was going to be silly (and was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend your time and money.
