Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in Russia in 1850. <br /> <br /> This is a misnamed film, with June Foray making some of the voices. Unfortunately, who was supposed to synchronize the voices with the lips was blind, since the words never match the lashes of the lips. Anyone who says that Japanese movies are bad has never seen this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is instantly forgettable, so I've forgotten it at the moment the movie ended, and for me to sit down and write this. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves made in the hope of moving from action to more plot-based films. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but it is deadly for the audience that has to go through nooze feasts like this, where everything is an intrigue with very little action. <br /> <br /> In Reeves' defense, he was a good actor, he just did not have much luck in choosing movies that were good. They all looked great, but very few of them did not put them in a coma during the movie's execution time. <br /> <br /> This movie will put you in a coma. Look at it only if you have the need to sleep and all other milder means have failed.
