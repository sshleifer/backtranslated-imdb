This movie has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I only observed about half an hour and turned it off. The cars in this movie look like the two corners of the front of Geo's subway. This movie is not even good for laughs. The only time I laughed was when Dante said in a funny voice: "No one can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa." I said holy god and I turned it off. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
