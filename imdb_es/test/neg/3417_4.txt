Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 set. With blood, blood and more blood. And a good dose of nudity. This will not be for all levels, too violent for some too cheap for most. Made with little budget, they try it and they do it better, but it only works sporadically. and this macbeth seems to be missing, it just is not convincing. although there is some good acting on the part of the majority, you do not get in the heads, especially of the mecbeths. the best performance came from Gary Sweet and the mick molly stranger. If you like Shakespeare, then veil, but if you like ripe cheese, you will love it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that good either. Sam Peckenpah would have loved it, that is, if it was filmed as a western. I expected a lot from this, since I loved the overalls of Mamluk. But this was a vacant effort.
