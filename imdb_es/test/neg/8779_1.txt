I remember that this bomb came out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern cinematographic techniques of the time. There was a bit of an answer about the treatment of the original "lone Ranger", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued to portray himself as the true lone ranger. (Moore acted in children's hospitals as a solo ranger for sick children). For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the only and only solitary ranger. He had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and the legacy of the lone ranger if Moore had been treated better. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. However, this was not the case, and many of the spectators stayed away en masse. Also history and acting were weak. All this added to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. Personally, I'm glad the studio lost a lot of money after the way the real lonely ranger was treated. You do not treat an American icon that way.
