As Ben Elton once observed, nothing was faster than comedy. Steve Martin's last offer, 'The Pink Panther 2', was recently opened to bad reviews and pessimistic box office, while Mike Myers' 'The Love Guru' seems to have won few fans. <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis' turn to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, his character in this movie experiences a funny twist every time someone uses that word in his presence) when "What way to the front? " He effectively removed it from the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this World War II comedy, he plays 'Brendan Byers 111', the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored of having success), but is rejected because of his medical disability. He then decides to start his own army financed with private funds, recruiting other 4-F's. <br /> <br /> Dressed in absurd uniforms that resemble those used by the 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds', they train. Some good visual gags here. When they shoot rocket launchers, they are satisfied with themselves, until they discover that they have just destroyed an oil station in Texaco! Wishing to learn German, Brendan plays a long-playing album called "Songs To Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a dining room with little water, they are in an opulent room adorned with a spider. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny like 'Finkel', Byers' - So an English butler. His best scene is when he blackmails a mobster-type mobster to teach how to kill Byers' brigade. <br /> <br /> The script was not from Jerry himself, but from Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of several episodes. of 'The Monkees'. "Front" often has the look of a television comedy, in fact, sometimes you almost expect to hear a song of laughter. <br /> <br /> Where it goes wrong is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a Nazi Commander and after ordering the Germans to leave the front, he gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise it's not in sight!). As a commander, Jerry offers a performance of such senseless ineptitude that defies description. It gives Brian Blessed a race for his money in the bets of 'the most alive man alive'. It's a relief when the final credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe the time was wrong: pulling out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was at its height was not a good idea. Or the public simply had enough of Jerry (that beard probably did not help!). What I needed here was a good producer, someone who would take him by the hand and say, "That gag sucks, throw it away!" 'Do not Raise The Bridge, Lower The River' is a masterpiece compared to this image. <br /> <br /> As the 70s progressed, the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty. Python: fresher, more biting and, in the case of Allen, more human comedy styles replaced Jerry's slapstick brand. It would not be until 1982 that he would do something like a successful comeback, such as the presumed interview host 'Jerry Langford' in Martin Scorcese's brilliant 'The King Of Comedy'.
