I was attracted to this film because of its unconventional, discreet and "real life" story line. That is, a boy in his twenties collapses in the Big Apple and returns home to live with his parents and with an even more dissolved brother. It may have worked, but there is a problem. And the name of that problem is Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His mantra of action must be "make the least effort possible at all times." Or "why talk when you can mumble?" Or maybe "put yourself in a coma as soon as the camera rolls." Lips moving when speaking? Barely. Facial expressions? Any. Muscles on the face? Atrophied Anything? Nothing. Anything? Zipper.
