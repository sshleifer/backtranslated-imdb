This movie should have come with a disclaimer that was similar to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a movie of the Bible. I expected it to really be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment. As one previous critic commented, it would be nice to show it in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the prior knowledge of the consumer about the premise of the film. I felt cheated by my money spent on this movie, since nothing in the summary refers to its religious connotations. If you go to church, it is likely to show up there for free some time. Apart from the cover-up of its true subject, the film was good in terms of acting and script. But I must say that I walked an hour after the movie when I saw which way it was going and that they were not going to entertain me, but to preach.
