As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a "better world". I said 'better world' because it is a lie that the Chinese have been indoctrinated for a thousand years! <br /> <br /> I suppose the majority of the Western audience may not know Qin Shihuang (meaning the first emperor), the king in this movie is the most famous tyrant of ancient China. The Tianxia (Chinese word that was pronounced by the king, means "the earth and the people") that is spoken of its mouth is totally false. From then on, one after another, all the kings of ancient China spoke the same, but very few of them did what they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang empire only lasted about twenty years before. It was destroyed by the people. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes in this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
