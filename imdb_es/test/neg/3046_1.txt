This movie is bad. Very bad. So bad that it made me want to shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First of all, the plot did not go anywhere and there was something shocking about this movie in the 30-second teaser. Secondly, anyone who has seen the original in 1979 knows that it was also a bad movie and that it is not worth a remake. By far, the best part of the movie is the house in which it takes place. Which does not say much for the movie itself. There were parts in the movie when the music has a lot of suspense and you're sure that someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the maid or the cat, but when someone is around the corner, it's impossible to be surprised because you've been waiting for all movie. So save your money, save your time, save your headache and just watch the trailer. It does not make any sense to see this movie, not in the movies, or on DVD, or on television, ever.
