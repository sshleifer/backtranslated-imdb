Hey, if people thought Ed Wood was a bad director, they would not have seen this movie. I mean, there were open field spaces and a little used cast. Special effects of poor quality. I mean, I can not believe this movie came from a Hollywood studio. A high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. I mean they had Erika Eleniak, who is a magnificent Casper van Dien and a low-rated actress. You should shoot your agents to ask them to register in this dribble, do not read the scripts. I still can not believe that the little listener was a survivor in the movie. I was hitting my head all the time why he and not a descendant of Van Helsing was the last man standing. I'm a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst, you should bet it so you never see the light of day.
