I would think that this was one of those films whose director had not read the book on which it was based, if it were not for the fact that they are a bit similar. Certainly, it is possible that a great movie was "based" very freely in a book and this was certainly the last but not the first. <br /> <br /> There was a series of failures. One was that he was trying to look too much like the Railroad Kids, probably because the adults expected this, being from the same author. Another is that he also sought to be like Harry Potter, to music and to emphasize the stage. I do not have anything against JK Rowling or the movies, but the book does not look anything like Harry Potter's. I thought that the Psammead, although very well expressed by Eddie Izzard and in his character as well, was almost free in a completely inappropriate environment. I may have missed something here, since the comments on one of the characters' books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. There was also no need for additional characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other does not. Who knows, he thought he was fine, but he was not as enthusiastic as he was not. I'm not sure what this means.
