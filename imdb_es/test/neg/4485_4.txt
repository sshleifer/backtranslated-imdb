A girlfriend told me to see this ... John was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and he looks great shirtless! I thought it was a love story about both of them, but mostly about their reactions to their letters. Savannah was a nice character at the beginning of the movie, but once she left, I lost respect for her. She said that he was destroying her by being away from him and that it was difficult: he was a million kilometers away, he was killing people and the only contact he had was through his letters. She did not have it difficult, she had family and money and he had a duty shift. I was so frustrated by the end when he forgave her, it was too much love. I would have waited 3 years and would have welcomed him home with open arms.
