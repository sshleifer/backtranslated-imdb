I saw it recently at the International Film Festival of Palm Springs 2007 and I can not believe that this is the official presentation of Sweden to the 79th edition of the Academy Awards to be considered as the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony last year also had the official presentation of Sweden for the best foreign film with Zozo. I personally was not a fan of Zozo, but at least I had some production value. This could have been filmed as a high school movie project. As a short film it may have worked, but as a feature film it is as lost as its characters. This is a story about five friends in their twenties who live in a small Swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their childhood. Actually, Falkenberg is not like a remote town in northern Sweden. It is a popular summer resort with a population of cities and municipalities of almost 40,000 inhabitants, and is located between the two main Swedish cities of southern Gothenburg and Malm√∂. The characters are quite nice, but if they were high school kids with a dark or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives, I would undoubtedly worry more about them. However, the time has passed when they should be making plans to deal with adulthood. If you want to stay in Falkenberg forever, there must be some jobs in the tourism or fishing industry instead of just riding a bike, drinking, smoking marijuana and painting a house from time to time. Maybe if they were with one or two girls in their circle of friends, of which the girls are absent from this movie, which does not make sense. Jesper Ganslandt made his directorial debut and co-wrote the film with the director of photography, of which he used the term carelessly, Fredrik Wenzel. The acting is not so bad. I would give this to 4.5 out of 10, but despite his presentation for the Academy Awards, I would not recommend it.
