This movie has it all: it's a thriller, a chase movie, a romantic story, a mafia story, a comedy, a road movie ... well, in fact, it's nothing like this. <br /> <br /> You're always waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you're still seeing the same boring, uninspiring and shallow clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the performance of the star cast lacks credibility. A hit man with his whims, a girl who is playing hard to get, types of mobsters who act like tough and incapable policemen, yawn ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend not watching Backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go see "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" by Tommy Lee Jones. Now, that's what I call worth seeing.
