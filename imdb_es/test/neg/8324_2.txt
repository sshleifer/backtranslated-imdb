(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> The legendary unfinished epic of Orson Welles was just that: unfinished. It should have been left as such, not put together in this clumsy and boring compilation of available material. <br /> <br /> Although I am sure that it was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers not only have to do justice to Welles' vision, they also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version on the audience. <br /> <br /> The first thing that surprises the viewer is the amateur quality of the audio. The recently dubbed voices are not only misinterpretations, but they are also inconsistent: Welles' original recordings (using his own voice, as he used to do) have been preserved in a handful of scenes, and do not coincide at all. There has not been the slightest attempt at coherence. Add to that an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimum of sound effects and atmosphere, a long sequence during a big festival (including bullfighting) sounds as if it had been recorded on a deserted street in a suburb with approximately three people. the sound of a crowd that must be thousands. <br /> <br /> However, the real problem is the inevitable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete, and it is very obvious to see this. The film consists of a handful of scenes attached and dragged to ridiculous lengths only to compensate for the execution time. Case in point: the sequence in which Sancho seeks Don Quixote in the city continues forever. It's just that Sancho approaches the people in the crowd, asking the same questions over and over again; There is no way that Welles could have used all the shots in their entirety, but that is what appears here. It lasts more than twelve minutes, when, in fact, it most likely has lasted about two minutes at the absolute maximum in an adequate finished version of the film. <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the film is relatively complete and fairly well done, the rest has huge holes that simply can not be filled with an infinite overlay of the Spanish countryside and even more shots of Don Quixote and Sancho back & Forth. There is no end either. There is no resolution, there is no conclusion, there is no argument, there is no point. <br /> <br /> Although there is material in private collections that was not available to the filmmakers, it could not possibly explain what it would take to turn this into a complete and coherent work. Welles simply did not complete the filming, in large part due to the fact that his main actor died before they could finish. <br /> <br /> However, leaving aside the fact that it was not complete, and could never be, one. I would think that just seeing a collection of images of this masterpiece could be enough. Unfortunately, putting everything together in such a careless way, one is left with a very negative impression of the film in general. In particular, what was clearly an excellent performance by Akim Tamiroff as Sancho is completely ruined with the new voice and with long and prolonged scenes that eventually make it simply irritating. <br /> <br /> The vision of Orson Welles for this film was something much more ambitious and complex than a simple retelling of Don Quixote's story, but that is what has been tried here, and as such, the point He is lost. The only person who could have gathered all the material into something worthwhile would have been Welles himself, and he did not. <br /> <br /> The archival material could have been much better used in a documentary chronicle of the whole saga. From Welles trying to make the movie. Welles himself even got the perfect title for a doc of this type: "When are you going to finish, Don Quixote?"
