*** SPOILERS *** Cute and sexy Linda Blair as the witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and her rival witch in the city Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia is getting her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion in his job at the Giger & Greengrass law firm about the most deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who is married to Erica, has cast a spell on Hal. to lose control of his car and end up almost committing suicide. <br /> <br /> Larry discovering Erica's attempt on the life of his best friend Larry has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony until her death. It is when Larry returns with his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things begin to heat up, emotionally and sexually. The evil Amelia tries to get the dead spirit of Erica to take over Carol's body and end up murdering Larry, whom she considers responsible for the injury of her husband Hal, who left him confined in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Not much of a story but a lot of cheese and core action with poor Larry being manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica, who plans to kill him the first chance he gives her back. Amelia is a little crazy without knowing exactly who she is and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to first lose his family in an invasion assault on a bloody house, then his mind, being accused by the police of being the murderer, and finally life, being ruined by Ameila herself. While she is with him, she runs to the house of the Reynolds, under her control, as angry as a hatter who tries to assassinate her as much as Hal. <br /> <br /> Larry Parks looked and acted so strangely that you had the feeling that she accidentally walked into the "Sorceress" set and ended up in the cast playing her role as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script, he improvised in his own way and then realized how terrible the film is. The death of Stan at the beginning of the film was a great advantage for him, since he did not have to suffer, like the ones we are seeing, throughout the whole movie without brain and hallucinatory. <br /> <br /> It becomes evident. both for you and the creators of "Sorceress" that all this shenanigan on the screen has to reach some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and ends a trick to finally finish the movie. The ending is about the best, in addition to Miss Blair and the rest of the cast of very well-endowed women, which can be said about the film.
