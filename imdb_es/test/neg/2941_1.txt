I saw this movie on Blockbuster and I thought it might be a good Sunday night movie when there's nothing else to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to get through my foot. <br /> <br /> The movie started very well. A little dark and mysterious. I was always captivated by vampire and samurai movies when I was a kid. I thought the combo would be really cool. The scene of the first fight was very good. I was excited for the rest of the movie. Then, the film was submerged seriously. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was a great success in the East. I guess for the twins. Although I do not see it. This movie, apart from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many films in this genre have the potential to be great, and to explode terribly. This is just another coincidence. <br /> <br /> The role of Jacki Chan in this movie makes no sense at all. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete stupidity. However, he probably won a few dollars. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie are the swords they use. Good idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
