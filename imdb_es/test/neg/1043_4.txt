Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move into their new apartment in Los Angeles. They discover an old brass bed that Karen likes, unfortunately has a really sinister story that involves perverted sexual murders. it fails miserably. The action is slow, the performance is nothing special and there is no suspense at all. Even the sex scenes are boring. The climax is quite bloody and violent, so fans of the splash should be happy. "It's deadly boring and it offers some tired horror film conventions and cheap fears ... Definitely one to avoid My rating: 4 out of 10 and that's being generous Look at" Re-Animator "or" Castle Freak "instead.
