What bothers me with the so-called 'scientific' programs like these is that it is presented as if it were a FACT that dinosaurs live 'millions' years ago. First of all, no one can conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the Earth is millions / billions of years old. It is a superficial theory based on inaccurate methods of radiometric dating with enormous assumptions thrown into the evolutionary well. <br /> <br /> Second, no one can prove that evolution has ever happened. All missing links from Darwin are still MISSING! If you look at all fossils anywhere on earth or on land, they are complete animals of a certain kind, for example: a dog or a cat. Nobody has found the skeleton of a dog becoming a cat or, in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur becoming a bird. <br /> <br /> This is complete nonsense. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that becomes another type of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe was created and everything it contains. . <br /> <br /> This series IS NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious worldview that hides under the banner of science. Science is something that we can observe and repeat. What you're seeing here is science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a science fiction program that has the decency to admit it's a science fiction program, then look at Star Trek or Star Wars.
