"On a clear day, you can see forever" is nothing more than an update of the New Age of the story of "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady": a teacher tries to turn an ordinary girl into a woman of society higher. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the teacher attempts to do so through hypnotism and regression to past lives. <br /> <br /> You know that a musical has problems when the reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before mentioning the plot and the music. The songs are instantly forgettable. (I am afraid that there is no "Take me to the Church on time"). And the plot is not going anywhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "there" here. The characters go through the story without ever going from point A to point B. Professor Chabot affirms several times that he will get to the root of Daisy's problems, but it seems he never does. <br /> <br /> All significant conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when Chabot University demands that you stop investigating reincarnation or resign your position. Now there is conflict! Will you give up your career for Daisy? Oh! Nothing comes from this development. One or two scenes later, the university changes its mind and tells Chabot to continue with his work. A lot for the conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent certainly met for this film: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yeah, starring Barabara Stries and she was almost at the top of her game at this point in her career. <br /> <br /> But everything collapses. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the aforementioned "My Fair Lady," is as doomed to failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past. <br /> <br /> If you like movie musicals, there are much better options than this.
