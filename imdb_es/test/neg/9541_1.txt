If a copy of this film fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of the bad, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that can adequately describe this stale piece of solidified vomit. This film even goes beyond the "so bad that it's good" phase and continues with the "so bad that your world will seem a little less significant because you've seen it" phase. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what is more disturbing: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this thought that their political satire (I use the term very, very, very freely) was ingenious enough to film .2. They were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for, obviously, little or no money. 3. That someone really thought that it would be a good idea to choose this shit to distribute it in a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I were a weaker man, I would most likely have put grapefruit spoons in my eyes and then I blindly threw myself to death in the oncoming traffic after seeing this. However, as it is, I live, but experience has always marked me.
