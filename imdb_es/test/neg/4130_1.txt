Fortunately, I watched this movie alone, which allowed me to quickly move through the worst scenes (actually, most of the movie). Okay, some of them are not all bad, with partially good photographs (even some of the scenes under the water) and, sometimes, they're not too bad for the address. But he still does not keep the script incredibly poor and much worse acting. Also, when I do not find "hottie" movies to be all that, even the love scenes that seem to be wanting to be boring become boring. Really boring! And for the drama: you know it's always a bad sign when you dislike all the characters so much that you really do not care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet gotten Tired of the Survivor reality series, you can find something you like in this movie. If not, be clear!
