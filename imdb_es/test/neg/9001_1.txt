Being a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr., I had to see this. What I like most about this are the clips by Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr., with all the old clips, which do not fit. with the new black and white footage. not even close to Steve martins the dead men do not wear plaid, that was done very well. With all the technology we have now, why was not this done better? dollars and some changes, keep in mind that this is really bad. but if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr, then watch their movies. On the other hand, even Wood did better than this one. The new actor Mark Redfield is quite good as an imitator of Bela Lugosi. The clips they use are; The ape, Mr. Wong, the most dangerous game, lost world, indestructible man. and the devil's bat. That notorious Bela Lugosi classic. I think this production had a very low budget, and it shows 1 in 10.
