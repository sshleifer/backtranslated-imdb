It's the year 2005, my friends ... a time of incredible special effects and an era of technology. So, why can not we watch a movie a little more thought out than this low-budget corny movie? I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that take my socks off, but this one ... it's almost like I'm trying to be horrible. Just ... do not ... look at it. I can see beyond the lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the performance itself was at least good. I feel like a little boy produced this whole movie. There is not even an original plot. Vampire Assassins, in itself is a big hole in the plot with an attempt to make fun of himself. Can anyone tell me if, perhaps, this was designed as a comedy film and I did not know it? I wonder, what does the sequel we love so much the first delivery?
