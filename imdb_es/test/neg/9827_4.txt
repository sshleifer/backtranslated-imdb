"Jefferson in Paris" is a truly confusing movie. Presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unpleasant way possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, but does not offer a pinch of condemnation for those sins. That's how it was, the movie seems to say. End of the sentence, end of the movie, the door is behind you. <br /> <br /> After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of an English gay painter (the underutilized criminal Simon Callow) . However, a turn of events sends Mary to England, and Jefferson proceeds to forget her with an amazing speed for a man who, just a few minutes before, asked him to live with him in the United States. <br /> <br /> He has been spellbound, as you see, by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves who has just arrived from America. It's hard to say why he's spellbound, although Sally is undeniably beautiful, acting like a simple-minded girl in front of Jefferson. When he is not telling ghost stories in exaggerated "dark" speech patterns, he sneaks around his room, practically exuding lust for his distinguished massa. <br /> <br /> If his behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson's, he does not. does not work Jefferson condemns himself even more when Maria, tired of waiting for her letters, travels from England to see him. I have not changed towards you, he insists, offering weak excuses not to write. To her credit, Maria sees through her blatant lies immediately. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, in my opinion) in the very presence of Mary, the illusion crumbles completely. <br /> <br /> No one believes today that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were absolute. Parameters of virtue and morality. However, we are supposed to believe that the wise and distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "friends of Massa's Frenchsa do not repent" and who rubs against his forehead when it happens. Right in front of Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we let it slide, it follows the horrifying revelation that Sally was only 15 years old when this affair happened (Jefferson, 41). Oddly enough, this fact only manifests itself towards the end, when Sally's brother, James, is understandably furious at the announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's son. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is equally upset when they tell him that Sally is carrying his son, and condescendingly tells him that he would be much better under his protection than in freedom and that he would live in France with his brother. But, he promises, I'll release her when she dies and our children (even anyone else who comes, says Jefferson, in a creepy statement by Sally as * her *) when they reach 21. Oh, thank you, massa, it feels like telling the screen . Big Deal. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is yet to come, however, with Jefferson's daughter, Patsy. She is already angry with him, first for breaking his promise, made to his mother on her deathbed, not to remarry. (Obviously, the woman was not only talking about marriage). Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wants, despite an earlier moralization about freedom of religion (which seems to mean the freedom to agree with him). <Br /> <br /> Having promised Sally and her brother their freedom, Jefferson calls Patsy to witness the deal and promise to honor him in case something happens to him. Sally's brother lets out the boy's imminent birth, and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although he has almost nothing to say. His face almost contorts with agonizing pain at this revelation, but he controls his pain and whispers yes. <br /> <br /> In any case, and the filmmakers could have had something if they had emphasized this point more, "said Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the state of women in the late eighteenth century, seen even by men like Jefferson as an attractive property, nice but without intellect or true soul. We see Jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from Maria, obviously telling him where to go, but soon he's laughing at Sally's wild dancing, complete with his hair pulled back and his chest heaving. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is a precise portrait of Jefferson or not. I do not mind seeing it, though, just to see it. This Jefferson is not a hero or even an anti-hero. He is a selfish and a liar who mistreats children, and one who gets away with it is not the kind of man I want to see a movie from.
