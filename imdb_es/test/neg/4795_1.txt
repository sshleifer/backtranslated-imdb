So we're supposed to find it fun that this woman travels to the jungle, to the war zone, only to find out why her girlfriend did not travel to Switzerland. Or are we supposed to take it seriously? It's not even remotely fun, smart or entertaining, it's stupid, and so is the movie. The main actress is one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a movie, even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialogue is very hard to be fun (almost all the time) but never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the plot, did they even bother once to explain to us why the rebels are fighting (apart from being anti-government)? I guess that did not matter to anyone, not to the rebels or to the characters that flew blindly to the battlefield. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is not funny or entertaining.
