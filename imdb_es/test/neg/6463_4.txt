On Thursday night, at 10:00 p.m., my local subsidiary on ABC's west coast broadcast the pilot episode of "Northern Exposure." The ABC network usually broadcasts "Men In Trees" in that space of time, but the program anticipated a live sporting event. <br /> <br /> Even though both programs are in Alaska and filmed at a place in the Pacific Northwest (Exhibition in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC), see "Northern Exposure" again "(as well as some episodes of" Sex and the City ") reminds me how disappointed I am with the ill-conceived hybrid" Men in Trees ". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer that ends in a small town in Alaska bothers me. Maybe because I feel that Heche is a disaster, I am not convinced of his "fish out of water" character. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that the cast of support fits the typical extravagant stereotypes. The attractive looking place, the friendly owner of a bar, the pilot of Bush, the local police officers, the spooky but well-intentioned DJ of the radio, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that could have been broken was the teddy bear. and the veteran actor "ER" Abraham Benrubi as the local barman in love with two different women. Considering that one of the executive producers is the filmmaker James Mangold, (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had main characters that were big men), then it does not surprise me why Benrubi was chosen for a non-typical role. <Br /> <br /> However, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits the peculiar niche for the television audience. I wished the program could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better programs.
