Incredible in a bad / good way ... this film has officially become the worst "movie made for television" of my book ... except for the value of the camp it offers, I give it a quality 1 and a 10 the camp value. Suggestion: look with friends, champagne and a lot of popcorn ... you'll want to take a little on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City' days ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the races of all the cast members ... honestly, I do not know how they controlled the laughter when the lines were launched! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. ALL participated in the school of acting; and poor Joan Van Ark, I think she was the only one who took this theater of the absurd seriously ... although she is credited as a producer. His "mama" jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene thieves. This film also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. This is a dark movie that appears on Lifetime as {With Harmful Intent} ... Has anyone else had the pleasure?
