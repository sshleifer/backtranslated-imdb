"Scientists in a remote laboratory experiment (insert a scaly creature here) and create monsters out of control." Meanwhile, a military crack team / the daughter of the scientist / bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are threatened by the giant bugs, they eat them one by one, all during an "exciting" race so as not to be exploited by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that this sounds like a dozen films that have appeared in the Sci -Fi Channel. I have to ask myself what is happening? Of course ... I like the bimbos and the Hollywood-Hunk aspirants who eat the CGI bugs as much as the next person ... but where is the plot or the originality? Of course, there are times when the science fiction channel shines. Battlestar Galactica, although a bit dark, can be very good. The writers have continued to bring life to the various Stargate offerings, and the latest importation of Doctor Who on the BBC is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various "giant animal" films on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to be improving all the time. Compare the kommodo in this movie with the rather awkward version in the first giant movie of kommodo in Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> But for God's sake ... how about a different argument? Maybe some giant creature? On a whim, I started searching the internet. Among the garbage I found some interesting stories that could attract SF fans and Russian CGI animators without work at the same time. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that you contact the author to get the rights to the story. (The story contains violent images generally similar to those of several offers of Science Fiction channels). <br /> <br /> History has a secondary, ethical and moral argument about the nature of humanity and does not end with one of them. horrible "REALLY killed all the monsters?" Moments, but it leaves you guessing completely and with a completely different mentality. <br /> <br /> What is generally what science fiction is supposed to do, right?
