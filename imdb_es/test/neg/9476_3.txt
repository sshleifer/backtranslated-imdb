Now, I saw this when I had a hangover on a Sunday and my aunt and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We got stuck on television and Passport To Paris had just started. My cousins ​​had said they looked at Two of a kind sometimes and I told them they could watch the movie if they liked it. Since I was not able to get up, I stayed in the living room with them and I ended up watching the movie! I have to say that, as a person who has no interest in such TV shows or movies, I really enjoyed it ... it must have been alcohol lol, but I admit it, it probably only attracts more girls between 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or a program that you do not think you like, but to laugh, you enjoyed it.
