This movie is horrible Create characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a hateful Jewish boy and a politically correct black girl. Not to mention the elves who speak Yiddish. The book was a simple story about beliefs, and this movie is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary movie about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is great, but Hollywood has ruined the story. <Br /> <br /> The good thing is that this movie will take a bath at the box office and maybe the producers will learn to avoid manipulating a story that does not need improvement. Hanks was exaggerated and I do not see why the voices of other actors could not be used.
