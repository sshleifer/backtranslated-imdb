I really do not know why I agreed to see this movie, but like a fool I did and that's why I deserve a shot! I had seen the original Killjoy, well, I said I've seen it ... I started to see it, but it seemed so bad that I ended up watching it at a 4x speed to overcome it and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I said I would look at it and did it even if it was at a speed of 4x. <br /> <br /> To cut a long story short, Killjoy 2 starts where Killjoy left off. With this I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and low cost. I do not have anything against low-budget films, in fact I enjoy them, they are something different from the big blockbusters, but this movie is just terrible! The acting is diabolical and the script ... well, I think you could have given Stevie Wonder a pencil and a paper, and he would have produced something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh that the clown has, which is obviously nicknamed! Anyway, I did not finish with this movie, about three quarters of the time it was time to turn it off and throw it out the window. It may have been a scam to buy like a DVD, but like a frisbee it was a mega bargain! <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of humanity itself. DO NOT look at this dirt, possibly the worst I've ever seen, and considering some of the dirt I've seen that says a lot. <br /> <br /> My rating on this movie would be ... Nailgun to the head / 10
