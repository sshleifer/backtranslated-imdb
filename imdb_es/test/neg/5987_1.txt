This movie entertained me with a lot of laughs to the actors that made the film move in all kinds of crazy directions. If you like suggestive language and attractive girls, they were all in the picture and the girls and boys were exhausted before they graduated from high school. There is a scene in which teenagers drive their car to a very fake deer and then throw it into a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over again. There is no horror in this movie, except the word Horrible for the whole image, and Arnold, who plays a plastic cop, is really a sick character. Please, do not waste your time watching this movie.
