... And it is a documentary that is not very good, because the American film seems to have confused some people to think that it is a fake documentary ("Mockumentary") and even some television lists of the newspapers described it as such . because it is easy to confuse this documentary with a big turn up. THIS IS THE SPINAL FAULT <br /> <br /> What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary focuses on the incipient filmmaker Mark Borchardt, who is ... How can I say it? More like an illusion? Yes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because if we did not have dreams we would all be living in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror films should not be taken as a criticism. since both Sam Raimi (yes, that one) and Peter Jackson (yes, that one) started making low-budget horror comedies, so once again, it's not a criticism. No, it's just that Mark Borchardt (yes, that one) is a parody of American garbage. <br /> <br /> Remembering SOMETHING ABOUT MA RY Ben Stiller gives a shove to an untrained hiker ("Come to my office because you're screwed")? Well, that's what Mark looks like to most of Jerry Springer's guests, so it's very easy to see why some people thought this was not a real documentary. Nor is it a very good documentary, since Mark and company give me the creeps. Did you know that someone thought that Mark would become a serial killer? Does anyone else think that there is much time left for this to happen?
