I guess to say that this is a terrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. The history of sub-Disney involves dogs playing football and falling in love (how cute!) The performance is not bad, but it could definitely be better, especially the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who, throughout the film, looks embarrassed, As if I did not even want to be there. Anyway, children will love it, but parents be careful!
