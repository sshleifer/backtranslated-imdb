In fact, I was quite surprised to discover that a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something that I would consider a strong point in the game universe. Do not worry, however, as in the typical Boll fashion, the story of the film has very little to do with the game on which it is based. Now I understand that you must take certain liberties to make a transfer from one form of media to another, but it seems that you really do not even try to make a connection. Not only that, but the action and action sequences are so cheesy that they almost make you feel like the whole project was a big joke. It has been said a million times before, but why could not someone more talented get the rights to video games to create a movie?
