Tedium like only the French can do it. I checked my watch for the first time in 7 minutes, and with 143 minutes to go, I also considered leaving. I will not even try to discuss the incoherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be nice, because about 1 hour later, I realized that none of this mattered. It was not merely self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a void. A vacuum that sucks souls. This movie has no saving grace, no pleasant character, nothing funny or anything sad. It is not smart enough to be a drama and there is not a moment that is absolutely ridiculous. The most intriguing aspect of this film is how it has managed to obtain positive and mostly radiant reviews. Those comments deceived me, but you do not have to be, kind reader. All I want for Christmas are my three hours ago.
