This was bad enough. I really hope there is no sequel. Maybe that's giving away part of the plot to let you know that it's open to possibility, but no, it really is not. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing great. <br /> <br /> There were some hot girls in it, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see people. PG-13, definitely not an R. That also tells you that the slasher aspects were less spectacular. The shovel on the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame fear rate.
