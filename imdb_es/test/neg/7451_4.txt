This movie started very well; The first 30 minutes are very funny and intelligent with some interesting characters. That is the good news. The bad news is that the movie becomes too repetitive and then it becomes completely stupid. <br /> <br /> What we just got is a Santa Claus with "magical" powers with a lot of New Age nonsense in the mix. It's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "Christmas movie" that I would expect from Jim Erney's "Ernesto." <br /> <br /> To be fair, I still had a lot of laughs and it's free of profanity, but it's not like that. A movie that I could recommend.
