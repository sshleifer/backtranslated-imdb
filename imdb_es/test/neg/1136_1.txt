God bless Randy Quaid ... his lixorous cousin Eddie on holiday and Christmas vacation stole the show. It even made the terrible Las Vegas vacation at least worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll say that he tries very hard in this TV sequel, but that the script is not so much fun that the movie never gets anywhere. . Quaid and the rest of the returning holiday veterans (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even Eric Idle of European Vacation can not save the show in a brief cameo ... <br /> <br /> Pathetic and sad ... really painful to watch ... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst of the Vacation franchise.
