Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy was wrong! On the other hand, A-PIX movies have a way of showing incredibly bad material, even worse than you might expect. I think this is the first sequel to A-PIX, and may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more sequels to A-PIX. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which the children of Jack Frost (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) begin to Kill people with the typical comic dialogue and silly voices to accompany him. They are shown as puppets (with a stick under them to move them) and as a computer animation, I have to say that it looks very corny. The computer animation surprised me, since the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this (both would do it It would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get all the fun, and because it would make more sense ("meaning" it is a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now only if there was "Uncle Sam 2" ...
