This episode was boring and I was not even in the realm of horror. So far this season, Masters of Horror produced a really good episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I have faith that the episodes will improve. I admit that the vampire episode was fine, but that it lacked a solid story. The episode about the capture of the serial killer couple started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. However, I am simply disappointed by the lack of originality and horror that the episodes of the first season possessed. Please save this season John Carpenter! I have faith that Pro-Life will redeem the whole dull season so far. <br /> <br /> "You are an angry little elf!"
