I became interested in this movie because someone had made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips of it. So I saw the movie. And in fact it is amazingly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not continue. It starts well, with interesting plots about people who surround possession of the Bride Rosa, but suddenly the elevators are filled with water and lose their walls, people move away and finally, for no reason, Utena turns into a car, and a high-speed pursuit occurs. <br /> <br /> I really like Anime for its ability to create alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you're going to watch this movie, turn off the sound, it's better that way.
