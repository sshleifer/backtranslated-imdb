Oh boy Movies like this really bother me. If this film is supposed to be close to the truth, then I assume that Rommel met Hitler for a time before the Second World War began. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed before. Well, I can not imagine that Rommel had not known something about Hitler's government policies, so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life in the end tragic. Did he make his decisions and do we have to feel bad for him? I can not do it. Nor can I buy the theory that if the most competent generals were allowed to fight the war, the allies would have had more trouble winning it. If more competent people were in charge, World War II will never have started in the first place. From the aspect of watching a movie, the film jumps from one place to another and most of the time it seems to be a special story with great actors who play historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has a couple of good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accents. But other than that, it's not very essential.
