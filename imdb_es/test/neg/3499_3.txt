The crash is overloaded, over thought and overcooked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important movie with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point of view and extends into almost every category of the film. He feels very much in love with his own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a pneumatic hammer for the skull. Of course, race relations affect everyone and there is much ambiguity in the subject, but the 'Crash' universe operates to suggest that we are all victims of our own perceptions of race. It is a heavy thread that repeats itself ad nauseam and runs out in the first 30 minutes. The results of the characters seemed unsurprising and forced, and the film took an eternity to appear and die. The fact that this film is among the 50 best films in IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to be fooled by Hollywood Malarkey. one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This movie plays as a preacher, bored and masochistic.
