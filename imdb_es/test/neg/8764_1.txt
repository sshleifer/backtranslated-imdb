I saw the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. Emmerdale's girl was fat, so yes, she should be in a fat friend, but no one loses what she weighs. <br /> <br /> As Itv made a big mistake with this. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I feel like the whole show was just about big people trying to lose weight, but they never did. They tried to have a love story, oh my God, what a waste of time and also time of transmission. This program has not been repeated in ITV2 / 3/4, yes, that's how good it is. <br /> <br /> I would say that "not per box" is just a waste of money. <br /> <br /> BE CAREFUL
