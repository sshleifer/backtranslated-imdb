As a Scot, the idea of ​​"Macbeth" changed in Time and Space to America is totally absurd. I'm sure this does not apply to open-minded IMDb Users, but why are so many Americans unable to relate to ANY movie concept that is not established in their country? This attitude does no favors to the Americans in the Great Wide World here. <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that "The Wicker Man" was remade and set in the USA. UU., Totally stripped of its cultural context, and with a Politically correct gender change for a main character. <br /> <br /> One wonders what will be next, Robert The Bruce as NYPD? Mary Queen of Scots as juggler of "Soccer Mom", children, a career and relationships? <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, open up to all the other Cultures of the Planet!
