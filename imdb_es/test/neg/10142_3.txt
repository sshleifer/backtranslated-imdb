I liked all the characters in this program from the beginning, except for Reba herself. She comes out as a saintier than you write and frankly a great Bully. And that sucks because she is in every scene and in every episode. In recent seasons, Van becomes unpleasant too, like a parody of his old self. and Kyra walks around mocking and being miserable. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end it is quite gloomy. Basically, in all the episodes, Barbara jean walks around being silly, Reba is being mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants her to like her, which makes Barabara jean tell Reba how amazing she is . every episode I think it's pretty clear to see that Reba has self-esteem issues and wants to be seen as a whole forgiven saint. It's really a shame too because apart from her, the show had so much potential.
