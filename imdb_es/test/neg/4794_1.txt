This movie is as bad as it gets. If you like logic (or lack of it) in the National Treasury and bad acting, then it could be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, spend your time under the sun and your money in a beer. <br /> <br /> Actually, it looks like a poorly produced promotional or demonstration image to promote the people involved (ie, actors, special effects, etc.). Accidentally they produce a bad exposure of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, the film company should be ordered to return money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really lousy.
