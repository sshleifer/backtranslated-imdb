I rented this movie because I noticed the cover at the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, the time setting of 40, and I thought "hmm, it can not be that bad". Unfortunately, after seeing it, my impression was "not very good". <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Chinatown scam, but the worst part is that apart from Nolte, the other team members did not get enough screen time. But it's a decent movie to watch once, I suppose. And Melanie's role was small enough that they did not give her a chance to be a nuisance.
