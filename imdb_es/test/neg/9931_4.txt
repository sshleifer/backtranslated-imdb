I have read the 28 most recent comments from several people regarding this film and I was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown in bed with "lost eyelids", while the camera is moving up and away from his face, blink Yes, blinks I recorded it like it came on HBO last weekend and when I saw it, I literally had to repeat it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I was not seeing things. Of course, after that, it was hard to take the film seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give a 4 mostly due to the fact that the first victim flashes in one of the last frames while the camera moves away from the body / face. Too.
