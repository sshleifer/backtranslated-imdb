There are programs and movies that I have seen and, later, I read reviews of IMDb.com with which I do not agree, and I am pleased to accept that there has only been a difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Positive reading the reviews of this filth just make me think of a sinister conspiracy involving the employees of the television network who are ordered to surf the Internet, publishing unconvincing reviews for the programs of which they themselves are responsible. <br /> <br /> How else would you explain a review saying that this program is "sure to become a phenomenon" a year after it becomes clear that it will not be any of that? <br /> <br /> I will not waste the words that describe this disaster, but it is enough to say that if you enjoy, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands who emasculate their children, children who are disrespectful to their parents and absolutely no another thread of behavior or subtext to legitimize the characters that, basically, are not funny. this sh u. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to go through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Development Stopped - Canceled. The war at home - Renewed. <br /> <br /> There is no justice.
