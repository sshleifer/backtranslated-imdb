A film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in a beautiful environment, managed to present an amazingly trivial production of clich√©s, extremely awkward scripts, little continuity, intrusive music, sugary music and pale performances. <br /> <br /> It was a rebound between the script and the acting as to what was worse. The script probably won: the historical background, the background story and the descriptions of the characters were explained with painful details in the dialogue. .. Actually, words can not describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In a pre-launch projection, there was a massive exodus of approximately thirty minutes in. About an hour, many of those who stayed were Laughing outrageously. I must add that I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and I love historical cinema. This really was one of them.
