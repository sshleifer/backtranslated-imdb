Return to the sender, a.k.a. Condemned, it is almost imperfect. The only good thing about this particular movie was that I never got bored. Having said that, it is possible that the reviews that consider this film a low budget success have not seen the same movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling what happens and what works and what does not. It does not work, I'm just going to comment that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that can lead through a semi. The acting in the film is not very good, although that may be the result of a script so badly written that it could have been a ghost written by George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional outfits or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were some holes in the plot? At the end of the movie, you're wondering how a blind man can be so good with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client's death, how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that breaks down for the rest of the movie, why Aidan Quinn did not do it for a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc. <br /> <br /> With all this being said, this is certainly a B-movie, and a terrible one at that. The unfortunate thing is that it is not bad enough to be good. If you value your time, let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this.
