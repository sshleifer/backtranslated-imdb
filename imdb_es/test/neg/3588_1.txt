The only reason for the existence of FC De Kampioenen is its local popularity. It has caused this comedy to run for more than 15 years (and still counting). <br /> <br /> It is an amateur football team with the "amateur" emphasis. Each argument is about the same subject: some misunderstandings that take ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to be resolved in the end. <br /> <br /> The program has been running for more than 15 years, and production probably decided not to do so. to change a winning team. Which means that the program has had small changes over the years (in addition to a couple of actors who were replaced (almost all were left alone instead of being expelled from the program)). The mood has not changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it aired for the first time. <br /> <br /> I guess you have to be flamenco to get this, and more than 60 years, to enjoy a TV show as old as this one.
