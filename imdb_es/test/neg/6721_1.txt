There are films that do not premiere in theaters but in video. This should be allowed to age and disintegrate like the old nitrate film does. No story, inept violence, acted in excess, poorly written and unfortunate is that the star was not the only bad part in the film. And I liked them and enjoyed some of Siegel's other films.
