I can not believe that the actors agreed to make this "movie". I could not bear to see him for a long time for fear of losing I.Q. Points for every second that passes. I guess nobody in the network that transmitted this drip saw it before putting it on. The IMDB ratings only go down to 1 per horrible, it's time to get some negative numbers for cases like these.
