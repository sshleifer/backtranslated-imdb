I saw this movie as a preview before the opening of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction will depend to a large extent on your attitude to respect for Shakespeare's text. On the positive side: Pacino gives a very good performance in fact as Shylock; Lynn Collins is a good Portia; And the movie looks sumptuous. <br /> <br /> The negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is possibly the most difficult of all of Shakespeare's plays on stage today, largely because we see it through the distorting lens of twentieth-century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia does not present any problem. The character of Shylock does it, because we lack the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations, and an abstraction of the implacable quality of the Old Law. When he says "Does not he have the eyes of a Jew?" he is a character; when he proclaims "I will have my bond!" He is an abstraction. The long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut into ribbons) is the key to the play, since it restores universal harmony after the disturbing and evil forces (the Shylock of the test scene) are expelled It is possible to give a psychological sense to the character of Shylock showing that he is going crazy and is becoming a monomaniac by the time the test scene turns, the key is that at one point he must stop being understanding. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does it, but not quite. The film can not be decided: on the one hand, there is the correct movement in the character of Shylock, and on the other there are a lot of strange images of abused Jews and Venetian whores with rough nipples. (No doubt to show the decline of Antonio et al). Shakespeare was not writing a social drama similar to Ibsen; I was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love against law at the center of Shylock's plot. <br /> <br /> In this In a sense, the film is a farce: Radford's surgery on the work and the direction almost distances us from what the work really means. (Take the beginning of the final scene, cut most of it and move it before the test scene is the most extreme example). There are other important difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a good actor, plays Antonio as if he had an overdose of sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is beautiful but shallow as Bassanio. Most of the actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor who plays Duke in the test scene, murmur their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final verdict? A nice movie with a few decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. It really is not worth your time or money, although Lynn Collins, like Portia, almost swapped it.
