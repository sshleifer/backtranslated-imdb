Enjoy the opening credits. They are the best of this second-class but harmless time killer who presents passable performances of the likes of Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, is for the newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who looks a bit diminutive for this type of action, but who, nonetheless, occasionally manages to project a kind of belligerency of roosters. The first time we see him, his torso is bare, sweaty, and he participates in his favorite activity "meatloaf": chopping wood. After this, she has seven more scenes without her shirt, including one in which she was hung from the dolls and hit Mel Gibson with electricity in "Lethal Weapon." However, he could use a better script, since the way he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. There is also talk of millions of dollars that are apparently related to this research, but that are never explained. There are some advantages, however, sending "John Woodrow" secretly as "John Wilson" is a fun game with a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as a prisoner who, at the beginning of the process, It appears hung from the wrists and receives a punch by a corpulent guard. One final note: the low budget of the film is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to house about 12 inmates! (Note: the cast credits at the end are not very useful.) For the record, Bill Fishback plays the corpulent, bald guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag, and the young, blond guard who administers the electric shocks to Tommy Lee. Thomas are played by Marc Chenail.)
