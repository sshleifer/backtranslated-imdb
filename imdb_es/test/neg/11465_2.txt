I just saw this in the cinema. I have not read the books. There is nothing new in this movie. <br /> <br /> the bad guys seem to die with a couple of cuts, no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword that keeps looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very false. the filmmakers seem to have the impression that when they can not be bothered to choreograph a fight scene, they simply move the camera up close, move fast and upload the music ... This leaves me feeling cheated once again. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to address a dark story without the normal Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry to say that the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are 2 dimensions. We hardly know or feel them for them at all. The protagonist has a lovely farmer accent oo arrr ..... although it seems he does not have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Do not bother to see this unless you're bored and have it halfway . price of blockbusters ....
