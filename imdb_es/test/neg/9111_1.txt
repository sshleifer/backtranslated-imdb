***** I reveal two 'turns' at the end of the movie. Do not read if you want to see this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the best current actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the writers must have realized that someone as pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as great as Sean Bean. Instead, he kills it in what must have seemed a wonderful turn at the end, by the good guy who was destined to be killed by Bean, but in reality he was his boss and faked his own death. Do not worry I have not ruined anything for you. The performance itself is spectacularly disgusting, with the look of Guttenberg's hard man patented "Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris-face" that dominates most of the two hours of hell in the land. Added to a plot that could have been written while being tortured and hung upside down with both hands severed, there is also a completely absurd critical error in the fact that in a moment the virus will escape if they look at it badly. while at another time, Steve Guttenberg is running with courage, throwing, catching punches and, in general, abusing this "virus" that has the distinctive look of a collection of those balls of soap that you put in your bathroom. My last word? If you are depressed by suicide and you feel that you want to laugh mania at something that should be a bad comedy, but even worse it is not, record the next time you are on channel 5 at midnight, then remove it when you realize that I am telling the truth.
