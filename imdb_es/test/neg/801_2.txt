Established in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the toilets busy, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko'), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially despite the fact that both have successful careers: she, as a high school teacher, he as an optics specialist at NASA's Langley Research Center, Virginia. They have a son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). <br /> <br /> One day, the Lewises find a package on their door, which contains a black box with a large red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward 'indicates that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain about the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, appears at the agreed time, cleverly dressed in an elegant Savile Row costume. He is polite but professional, however, his most notable feature is his face, half of which seems to have been destroyed and taken care of incorrectly. Langella is the only thing worth seeing in the film, however, unfortunately is overshadowed by her own makeup, which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) of 'The Dark Knight' by Christopher Nolan . It's like the elephant in the room: you can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will be back in 24 hours to pick up the button. If, during that time, they decide to unblock and press the button, he will give them $ 1 million in cash. The only problem, and it's a big one, is that somewhere a stranger will die. It may be on the other side of the city, it may be on another continent, however, Steward assures them that the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a sign of good faith, leave them with a $ 100 bill, to keep the button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing that all this is a scam or an elaborate deception, however, it does not take long before they start to wonder what would happen if they pressed the button. Would they really get a million dollars? Would someone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma hits the button. Nothing happens. However, his initial relief gives way to the alarm when Steward appears the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to cancel the whole process, however, Steward tells them it's too late. "You have already pressed the button," he explains. When Steward's limousine moves away, Arthur writes down the license number, which he later discovers is registered with the National Security Agency (NSA, for its acronym in English). <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to deviate deeply into an unexplored territory like the secondary characters begin to bleed through their noses and blink signs of peace. Meanwhile, the city is invaded by plump, jaw-dropping geeks with bad shirts who start following Arthur as an advanced exploration party for a race of alien zombies. Arthur eventually gets trapped by the threatening library worms in the library (?), Where Steward's spineless wife appears, whom we have not seen until now, and informs Arthur that to leave the library he must enter one. of three vertical columns of corny-looking digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Arthur asks, looking much less bewildered than he should be under the circumstances, and certainly much less bewildered than the audience is at this moment. "Eternal curse," says the old maid sinisterly. <br /> <br /> Arthur enters the central column of the effects of digital liquids, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his cocoon of water, floating on Norma's bed. When he wakes up and sees it, the water bubble bursts and Arthur falls on the bed in a shower of water that, oddly enough, continues to drip from the water pipes that are out of the camera's reach while Marsden and Diaz sink bed. <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, we learned that Steward was once the public relations officer of the NSA, until he was struck by lightning that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but then he came back to life, transformed into a kind of superman who now serves "those who make the lightning bolt" and whose powers have allowed him to take over the CIA, the NSA and NASA. itself. <br /> <br /> And what is the point of all this gossip garbage? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical test (for example, the "Isaac Link"), to determine if it is worth saving humanity. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's superiors will save the race. Unfortunately, those people who do press the button, like Norma and Arthur, should be punished for their lack of moral spirit, so they are subjected to a series of sad tests of "Lady or Tiger" that develop as one of those " I watched movies, 'except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot. <br /> <br />' The Box 'represents the kind of useless mental masturbation that first-year philosophy students prefer to talk about after a few Beers: The tedious exercise of Richard Kelly in the existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility, the tortured mixture of unbearable ideas eventually freezes, as with the mixture of too many colors, in a gray pettiness of a film as insipid as one of those narcotics films in flight whose plot suffers no more or less than interrupted by a leisurely nap. <br /> <br /> There is a point in 'The Box' in the that Arthur, who is a technically minded guy, is curious about how the button works. When you open the unit, you are disappointed to find nothing inside. <br /> <br /> Having seen The Box, I know exactly how it feels.
