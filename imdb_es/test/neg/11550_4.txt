"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first show of Jeff Daniels who writes and directs talents. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse debuts, but this one is not so good. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. As we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the deer hunting season in 1989. He is approaching the oldest Soady record for not making money. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal clich√©s. But there is a warmth there that tells you that this is not being mean. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben is heading to The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a native. American necklace, your lucky hat and two forms of liquid that you probably do not want to know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she is really the only one who believes in him. He finally arrives at the camp where his dad, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will soon show up. <br /> <br /> All right, let's move forward. Here are some laughs, a few moments when I chuckled. But most of the jokes here are used several times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest disadvantage is the spiritual / Native American events. Just when you settle with the characters, strange things happen. But the special effects are so cheap that it's all, it's a great flash of light and then the head swings back quickly. <br /> <br /> And the end, well, it's not worth anything. <br /> <br /> The movement itself was not bad, the peculiar character and the funny parody were good. But I should have stayed in that. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from a movie of demon possession. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanaba in da Moonlight" a 4.5 out of 10.
