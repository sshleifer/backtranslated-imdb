SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I'll never forget ... by the way, my husband rented this amazing non-snitch up, almost a girl-looking movie. ... but I guessed why when I saw the cover ... girls in school uniforms ... duh .... hehe ... well, men, if you can not beat them, join them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorites on the independent screen ... too cute ...... not only becomes bestiality (your puppy is the best lesbian in the city according to its spooky and scandalous character) ... that would be the first scene worthwhile ... <br /> <br /> Then he enters a bathroom with a beautiful dress and enters a position ... After a while, she gets up, goes to the party in which she and the sadly pathetic character of 'Gato' meet, and hands her a bucket of bright silver ice to the host of the party ... the host looks at her beautiful silver ice cube and says: My God, it's poop. "<br /> <br /> I also love Bijou Phillips for his creativity and unusual film choices, this would definitely be one of them .... and um, I'd rent it for the poop scene if it were you ... I'm not a big fan of poop jokes, but it definitely puts the "party people" in their place (they did not). Anyway, it seems that they were having a good time ... hahaha ... You will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is that what we want in our data banks? ... Maybe you should not follow my advice ... hahaha <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is a bit squirrel and sad in her confusing nonsense role in 'Tart'. I do not know, I can not decide if I like it because she is so interested in independent films. The independent films are incredible and all, but could not she choose some good ones? I'm going to watch a little more of his films and reserve the trial ... but this was, (he forgives the reference to the beasts) a dog ...
