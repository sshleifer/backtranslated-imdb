I'm glad I did not wait too long when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite childhood movies. The story was boring and unconvincing as the characters were, and I was disappointed that some of the original characters were not in this sequel. Nor did I think that the characters were similar to those of the previous movie. Charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. The first movie had good music, but the music in this movie was memorable. In short, this movie just did not do it for me. And, seeing the comments of other users, it seems that it did not for many of you. It's not worth seeing.
