When I saw this movie, all I could think was: What a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I have seen many movies, but this is one of the worst in history. I do not care if an erupting volcano below the center of the city is possible or not. Maybe it is not, but even this could have been a good movie ... but it sure is not and I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much lava flows. of an average volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano in this film makes Vesuvius, Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo look like a small barbecue. I do not think there was as much lava coming out of a volcano as what we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really wonder why he spent it all on special effects and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying I should have hired a first-rate cast, but this is really the opposite of what I would call a good performance. Their performances are so incredibly poor that they make the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script probably asks you. Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea that people are a few meters or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for health? Or people who sink into the earth when the lava flow does not reach two meters in height? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would not be proud if I wrote a script of this type, but apparently there are script writers in Hollywood who do not care about credibility, as long as I pay good money! VERY good money! <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you will probably agree with me that this is one of the worst disaster movies in Hollywood, which is worth only 3/10.
