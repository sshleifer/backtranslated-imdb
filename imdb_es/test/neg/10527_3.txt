This movie was disappointing. After 15 years, when he remembered to review some information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regret I felt for the movie came true. Although I remember Peter O'Toole, I did not take into account the fact that the female "leader" (well, she was little more than an object of discussion in the story) was Mrs. Hemingway. I saw this movie in the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people not to do it, because the stories just did not work, and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to solve things has not yet made sense to the flow of ideas <br /> <br /> Part of this may have to do with the fact that it seemed that, after the original movie was filmed (in any way), an editor came in and tried to put something together. of that I do not know if this had been a project of a previous studio leader, so it was sabotaged to discredit it by the successor, or this was a disaster of the original script that the attempts to rescue were unsuccessful. The theatrical version just did not work.
