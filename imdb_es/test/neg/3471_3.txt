"Imperium Nero" is the second film in the series of six productions called "Imperium". I have already commented unfavorably on the first: "Imperium Augustus". This second film for television produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state network has the same flaws. It also contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him: "Nero, Nero". At that time his name was Claudio. He was named Nero after his adoption. Nero did not know Acte when he was young like in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his nomination to the Emperor. When he became emperor, his children were not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia is one year old. And many many more. If you like ancient Roman history, you can find other examples. The series "Imperium" will continue with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
