It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What a skin movie that is a bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite MST3K episodes ... Just a few things to point out ... <br /> <br /> 1) The incestuous mother-daughter interchange between lesbians was strange. I need counseling now. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God, there is only one Friend ... I love that quote from Crow. <br /> <br /> 3) Whatever happened to the Nuns That took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, do not watch this movie without MSTied ... You have Joe Estevez as the main star ... Go ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 for a -MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.
