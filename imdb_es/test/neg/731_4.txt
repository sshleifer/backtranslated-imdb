The absurd premise of this film has to do with that Argentina claimed the Falkland Islands, having failed by force in 1982, impregnating European women with Argentine sperm, thus diluting the ethnic purity until it favored Argentina. Yeah sure. Fabio, our hero / villan and cad, makes the reconnaissance and takes his fish-eye video camera from the column to the secret filming of his encounters with the Falklands, including his courtship and the eventual conquest of a woman, Camilla. An unfortunate and fraudulent independent documentary, this film favors us with a lot of boring sightseeing shots from the hip ... yada, yada, yada. The film has no potential for the plot and only begins to be interesting when Fabian and Camilla make their way through the usual moments of discomfort and uncertainty when they move from the handshake to the bed. "F * ckland" is only for the purists of the cinema who can appreciate the sombre austerity and without luxuries of the Indian Dogme.
