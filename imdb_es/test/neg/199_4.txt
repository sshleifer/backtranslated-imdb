I just saw in UbuWeb this first experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read correctly, Orson Welles! Years before he gained fame on the radio "War of the Worlds" and his debut in the feature film Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 years old and only found his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player here was a Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who is sitting on something that rocks by the courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in black face). During this time, a man (Welles) keeps going (courtesy of the scene that is constantly repeated). I will not reveal more, except to say how interesting the silent images were, as they jump and cut constantly. That does not mean that this was good, but it was fascinating to see it even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added to the 2005 print that I saw. It is worth visiting Welles enthusiasts and anyone who knows the avant-garde.
