This is "realism"? If Rivette was trying to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she could influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he has failed miserably. The highlight is that we never realize why thousands of men would have followed her into battle. Certainly, there is not enough exposure of the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, as far as God knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as presented here. Unless the Bonnaire wooden posture and the flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination. The use of the landscape is especially lacking in inspiration: we never lose the feeling that we are seeing twentieth-century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, in contrast to some affirmations of the commentators, occupy a good 15% of screen time), they resemble some History Club of their local high school that recreates a medieval siege, although children would do it. No doubt put more passion into it. However, I will give Rivette credit for imagining one side of Joan that other movies have left out: that of a petulant, naive and narcissistic teenager (played by a woman too clearly, at least twice the age of the character who she is supposed to have portrayed) she obviously can not understand her place within the movement that she is helping to create or the world that exists outside of her own passions. Joan's outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishing the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are incredibly spontaneous and credible notes (you suddenly realize that such moments must have occurred) in a historical "representation" that another way does not imply. Unfortunately, they also serve to pinpoint what is not addressed on the screen. What made Joan SPECIAL? I must say that I also remained baffled and frustrated by certain lovers of foreign films that equate boredom and lack of dramatic participation with "art" and "seriousness". Does this movie really increase our understanding or participation in the subject? Or with something for that matter? 4/10.
