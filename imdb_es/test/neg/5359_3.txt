Can anyone give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and when it does, it's supposed to be a very emotional scene, and yet when the Delta Force Operation team kills hundreds of Russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or Thousands of Arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, are supposed to animate and say "Take that, non-American monsters!" I know I used "action scenes in slow motion" a lot, but that's because every action scene in this movie is, you guessed it, in slow motion. Each one of them ... And this squad should be called "invincible Slow Motion Bullet Invasion Force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them dodge bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the entire non-American army that stands between them and the victory. At this point, nobody cares, since another action scene in slow motion that made them sleep ... That's if they are not laughing out loud because of the bad performance, the cheesy dialogues and the incredibly poor story. What did I do ... The cast is made up of unknown actors, who will probably remain unknown as they do not even play characters. They are just playing guys with weapons (and, let's not forget, superpowers) ... The only quality is that special effects are surprisingly not so bad (although they are in slow motion) for a television movie ... But it still stinks ... and at the same time it's so bad that it's good ... Well, maybe in the end it's too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
