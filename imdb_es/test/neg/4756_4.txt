I love B movies, but from the beginning I like to be aware that I'm watching one. I can not believe that someone could ruin a movie about aliens and predators so badly. <br /> <br /> Foreigners and the predator are AWESOME. This movie made a great joke of them. The creators did not take this movie seriously at all. I am completely disappointed in how Strauss pulls handled this movie. They made a mockery of incredible characters. It is as if they were trying to be serious at first, then their writers got high and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were terrible and they were not foreigners or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect for the original films. They should not be allowed to collect the names of previous films and should be ashamed of themselves.
