Although a well produced film for television, Dying to Love You reeks with a melodramatic, low-grade splendor. <br /> <br /> The film opens before Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking much older than I remember him to be), who is a businessman who struggles and leads an empty and lonely life after he his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves him quickly. Now all Roger has are his cats ... and his ad in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> Once your ad is answered, call Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh, it does not matter if I'm the one you want Lawrence to be. Then ... they have sex on the phone. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you are or when you were born, but I remember that part of the sex on the phone was played in the late 80s. Sorry, but that was of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and the broad are hooked and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas and then have sex with Roger's son in the other room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a fool who loves to sleep. God forbid that women only sleep with one man. Very soon, strange calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and she continues to talk about her ex-husband, who used to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe in all this. That's until a disheveled co-worker tells her to go snoop around among her belongings like a meddlesome housewife. He takes his damn advice and finds a suitcase full of fake ID cards, wigs, weapons and a crossbow. Immediately take the suitcase to the police and stop it. Despite all this jazz, he still loves the dumb. She says so many lies, it seems that her tongue will burn if she tells the truth once. <br /> <br /> Roger continues with his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something outside of Gremlins 2. She also has a son and Roger has a great affection for her. But something inside Roger's subconscious keeps him connected with Lisa Rohn (if that's his real name) and he keeps coming back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa is the "ex not going away", as she "earns" a card to get out of jail and shows up at Roger's door and her son Matt is so busy trying to Verify that you pour juice all over the floor. IL 'Rog is so stupid that he shoots Lisa and does not even change the locks. Boy, if all the people were so stupid, I would not even be writing this review. The end of this movie is so corny that you will not believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a king of the movie Made for TV. He only looks like a mummy like dawm in this movie. It is a bit of wood and rigid. The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trap seems to be true. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to see when you're in that nightly council, but, again, you could fall asleep, considering how boring and bland it is.
