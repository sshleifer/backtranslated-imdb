I saw "Gristle" mainly because of the presence of Michael Dorn, while enjoying his interpretation of Worf in Star Trek TNG, but I had never seen him without his makeup. Dorn seems to have a good presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. This movie, however, gave him a small dramatic challenge, except to show that he can, in fact, use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was made by someone who imagined himself as a forward. -type thinking, with a social conscience. Yes, by 1965. Today, the subjects are as complicated and sophisticated as the corn ball that even the hideous "Bamboozled" by Spike Lee looks good in comparison. -, triple and quadruple crosses, but the scheme of the plot is so complicated that it collapses on itself in the first 30 minutes. Above all, after that moment, I simply observed the impulse and a slight curiosity about how each scene would unfold. Here is a great cast: you will recognize almost everyone as an actor of much better movie characters. Why are you all in this? I suspect it was 1) Work, and some money, even modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these actors from the acting classes and the social connections in Los Angeles, you know, maybe they participated to support him, as a film partner who fights in the third and fourth level of the scene of Hollywood I do not know ... but the movie was half done, not really "finished". I gave him a 3, although my affection for the actors involved did not diminish due to my admiration for his previous work. Hopefully everyone has gone on to more professional, more carefully made and more comprehensive projects since then.
