In the mountains of Japan, the young abandoned artist Sessue Hayakawa (as Tatsu, also known as "The Dragon Painter") paints magnificent landscapes. He prays: "The Divine" will restore his girlfriend, whom he believes was transformed into a dragon, 1,000 years ago. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, an old and helpless painter, Edward Peil (as Kano Indara) regrets not having a son to carry the line of artists of his family. When Mr. Peil sees Mr. Hayakawa's paintings, he sees a painter worthy to become his "son and disciple". Hayakawa also falls in love with Peil's daughter, Tsuru Aoki (Ume-Ko), believing that she is the reincarnation of her lost princess. But, with his love fulfilled, does Hayakawa lose his ability to paint? <br /> <br /> An introductory note, "'The Dragon Painter' was originally released in 1919 by Haworth Pictures, a Hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by Sessue Hayakawa, an actor born in Japan who He enjoyed a lot of popularity in the period of silence, the film was the ninth of the twenty-two films produced by Haworth, each of which adapted to the talent of Hayakawa and his company of Japanese actor's actions. " Fortunately, a copy of this film was found, in France, and it was restored. <br /> <br /> The description, "The painter of dragons is a fantasy-allegory of love and the creative inspiration that is lost when the longing is fulfilled" is precise. "With his production, Hayakawa aimed to provide a different view of Japanese culture to American audiences, avoiding the stereotypes, violence and melodramatic conflict expected in the 'oriental' films of the time." Hayakawa succeeded in that part of his goal; Although, this movie probably did not and will not attract the majority of the viewers, and it is not the best example of its intention. <br /> <br /> **** The Painter of Dragons (9/28/19) William Worthington ~ Sessue Hayakawa, Edward Peil, Tsuru Aoki
