This film begins with children telling urban legends like the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra in a chicken coop. Unfortunately, it then becomes his basic anthology film. The first was about a concierge with a bit of secrecy. This is fine at best. Then it gets worse as the next story about this child obsessed with dead flies goes on and on and on and on. It's too long and not so interesting to begin with. After that you get the typical shock scene and it ends. You need more than this in an anthology film. You need at least three stories and one should not be so long that it becomes terribly uninteresting, especially considering you can see how it will end a mile away.
