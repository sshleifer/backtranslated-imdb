Obviously, this was the worst movie ever made ... ketchup was the starring role in this film and he would be the only nominee for a prize ... because the plot, the actors and everything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous. I could have made a better horror movie in my yard in two hours with a hand-held camera with grass-filled dolls as actors, at least the performance would have been better! Do not waste your time or money on this ... it's extremely cheesy and horrible!
