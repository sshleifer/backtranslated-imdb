This movie supports self-justice! It grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end frees himself from scandal! However despicable it may be, there is also adultery in this movie. The character of Connaughey has the sympathies of the character of Bullock and the film has some of those stereotypes of proof films (like the important news brought to the court at the last moment) that make any aesthetically demanding viewer like me sick. I really can not believe that someone would like this garbage. It is a film so bad and with false ideals that I can not put my critic in an eloquent and pleasant way. When will the American people wake up and discover that they are being manipulated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by films like these that turn reality into a BS where justice exists for everyone if they only take it in their hands ? This attitude of cowboy makes me sick and in my opinion represents everything that is wrong in America!
