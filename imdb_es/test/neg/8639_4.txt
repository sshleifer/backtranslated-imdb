Once upon a time Theresa Russell made a few decent movies, so I'm still hoping that one of her efforts of the last decade or two deserves a grade of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is only the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very difficult to see. The lines are delivered by the main actors as if they were being read in a first rehearsal or even in a casting session (in which the actors do it for the sake of their agents, but in reality they do not want the parts for which they are fundamentally reading). The sets and accessories seem "off" in some way (what kind of police department would allow a detective to have a whole wall in the living room full of case file bearers?). The screen is constantly full of time and meaningless data lines, which appear without rhyme or reason. Now, if the screenwriter was standing here after the lights of a film festival screening went on, they would not doubt that all these deficiencies are really clever clues that the plot would go crazy in the last five minutes of this failure. . Well, for those members of the audience whose only other film experiences are TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; They could be tricked into nodding agreement. But it's hard to believe that ANYONE who has seen 10 or more movies in his life, and is not a close friend or relative of a cast or member of the crew of DARK WORLD, could fall into such a lame canard. Despite what d.v.d. This box can make you believe, this movie is so similar to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrator device) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a bottle of Jim Beam that has been emptied and filled with urine.
