LOL. - Oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes, green eggs and ham make more sense than this movie. Where does one start? Many good things have already been said, so I will not divulge them in the same territory. I think you already have the summary of the movie, so I'm not going to paraphrase the movie. <br /> <br /> First - let's start with good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you. This is one of those films that illustrate the question you always talked about on long car trips when you were children (What would happen if I had to choose a family member to live, another to die or what would happen if I had to drowned or fired)? This movie is a great concept: the conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The costume group did a good job going back to the 70s. However, realistically, how hard is it to achieve that? ..... Okay, that's all for the good. Let's talk about the bad. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie feels like a 2 hour "Twilight Zone" episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That could have made the film tolerable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember the movie "From sunset to sunrise?" The movie started interesting, and then, in the middle of the movie, did it take a demeaning turn? Yes, the same here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept and then they had no idea what to do with it. I have obtained a deeper thought provocation from Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we have the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical nuances and the utilitarian approach, but the story leaped too much, did not give more details about the arc of current history, and took (forgive me) a completely insulting direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The end did not make sense. No way. Any. <br /> <br /> This movie would be a great role for the term in philosophy 101 of the university. If you embark badly, you get sick in bed or if you've ever liked to be pasted on your face with a cake, and you can see it for free online: by all means, go ahead. <br /> <br /> If you need to pay something to watch this movie, do not waste your time; It is better to see the old Howie Mandel standing on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation by reorganizing your sock drawer.
