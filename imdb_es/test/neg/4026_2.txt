I do not understand how this garbage came to the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie! It was amazing, a group of friends and I decided to see this one night and it was the stupidest thing any of us had seen, I could not believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes in amazement that someone really thought about this and then turned it into a movie. Are they in the crack? My guess is yes, in large doses. I doubt very much that nobody likes this garbage. Is this supposed to be science fiction or comedy or what? I do not think the idiots who did this cared, they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many fools could cheat to see it. Well, we put something in the movie, so let's take it to the movie store and see if it really was put on the shelf. No no no. This is not making movies. Acting is like watching wooden puppets move and read a book, that's how bad it is. I want to go to the movie store and complain and get my money back, nobody should have to put up with this shit. So I'm here to warn you: DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen!
