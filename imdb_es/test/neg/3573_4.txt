That's what he asked me during the many fights, games of shouting, insults and the general chaos that permeated the 84 minutes. Comparisons also stand up when you think of one-dimensional characters, which are so shallow that it's practically impossible to worry about what happens to them. They are just badly written ciphers for the director to support their multicultural beliefs, a subject that has been made much better in other dramas both on television and in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I must confess, I'm not really one to detect bad performances during a movie, but it must be said that Nichola Burley (as the best friend of the heroine) and Wasim Zakir (as the nasty and abusive brother) They were absolutely terrible. I do not know which acting school they graduated from, but if they did, they would request a full refund in a hurry. Only Samina Awan in the lead role manages to impress a cast of the so-called British talent that we will probably never hear again. At least, that is hope. Next time, hire a different explorer. <br /> <br /> Another intriguing thought is the horribly fashionable soundtrack with characters like Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now, I'm a bit of a music fan and I'm familiar with most of these artists' production, but I did not recognize any of the tracks during this movie (apart from the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, someone? We receive many, many musical montages that telegraph how we are supposed to feel. These images are accompanied by images as amazing as couples kissing in a bloated lake and get into the doors. This is a problem, since none of the songs transmits the mood efficiently, and we realize that the director lacks the ability to take the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposed to mean to be just desserts, since everyone gets their deserved and there is at least one big commotion in the store ... But I remained decidedly impassive because the script had not given me No one to encourage him. It is not enough to address a burning issue, you have to give us a plan that has not yet been made to death and people who are more than a showcase. As it is, this movie is a noble failure, with only the promising lead actress and a few funny pitches to save her from the trash. 4/10. Must try harder ...
