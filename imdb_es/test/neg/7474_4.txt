... a recommendation! Gloria Grahame directs the type of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver, the orphans are hung from meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept frozen so that they can be taken out for when the social services request it. It is known that the orphanage does not have enough money because Gloria puts all the orphans to work and also because there does not seem to be enough clothes to go around, especially for older nubile orphans (the age range seems to be 12 to 30 years old) . ish). The new arrival, nevertheless, turns out to be more than a rival for Gloria, and in fact it has just removed to its own mother and the lover of the mother (in an ingenious scene of opening of hammer and arson). As expected, Gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. This was done for roughly tuppence but it was / is a HUGE HUGE HUGE on the Grindhouse circuit. The cover of my DVD promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes", and I'm sure he was not lying. I think he's considered as the citizen Kane of the established orphanage torturing porn movies. 4/10
