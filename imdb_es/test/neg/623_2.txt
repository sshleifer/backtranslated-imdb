I'm an atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film was made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated as if it were a history book. Well, it is not. The film is about the novels of the 1950 version. Some actors were BIG, but that does not cover the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, man invents a super bomb for God and his friends to hold a court to see if they should intervene. The analogy of the devil pursues man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first accused Adam? Eventually, you get Christian propaganda from the United States in a fifth grade history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First we get the history of the caveman. Women are squalid stereotypes of maidens in distress. The true women of the caverns were as strong as the men and so resilient. Hard times, hard life, adaptation and survival. All this is diluted by mid-century stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Next, we obtain the first pyramidal construction of Egypt. Today we see a different story and we know that there were fewer deaths and also ordinary citizens at work. Losing the mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and no one else would try. As if there was only ONE pyramid built. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and a true god was as if the Spanish Inquisition asked kindly. The inquisition itself was not even mentioned in the movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's villain was so vile that I did not understand why so many were interested in her. In reality, they were only soldiers, following the orders of the commanders, who were "discussing" a political question of power. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was where I saw that this film was inaccurate and full of propaganda. Here the brother was much younger. I was not obsessed with poison, I was quite educated to restore the contents of the library and was politically competitive to drag Egypt off the ground. <br /> <br /> The part with Nero and the Christians praying in a cave was disgusting. Yes, Rome burned. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portrayed it was as if the Coliseum were built alone and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome. <br /> <br /> Attila the Hun appears in brief view and then we jump to King Arthur. Crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the East crusades to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The gentlemen went home and started to get together for fun. MANY things are put as if there were no indoor plumbing, hygiene and pests. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Juana de Arca, where she always has a lot of makeup and looks like a princess. The territorial policies were replaced by an unfair court. The side seat alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could stay here. In the burning here I wanted to shout "Hura! Die now! Cheap special effects, where's the fire?" <br /> <br /> When they mentioned Leonardo, he was fed up with the movie. Columbus, the Spanish massacre of America, shouting to Queen Elisabeth "kick the Spanish army" and so on. <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with Marcos' 3 brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Fun, but no more than a smile. <br /> <br /> The witch hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as the plagues (after the rebirth). When they start to portray revolutions, things are hungry for power and anarchists. The American revolution was persecuted by the French Revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can not blow away the old form of anger, you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we got Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace their motives for unity and unite it only by the title "Emperor." The conquests in Europe, the defeat in Russia are dismissed from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The civil war of the United States, the rich English inventors (Tesla not included). "Mr. Watson, come here, I love you" almost makes me laugh for reasons of adolescence. The arduous technological work was diluted until the final discovery and the comic misuse. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 85 minutes, we came to the world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. The words of Adolph "I invaded Russia, this is my last territorial demand" were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand. <br /> <br /> To create suspense, God sets a countdown clock for Judgment Day on the "wall" of the final words. Can not all the powerful ones pause in the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech, but the defense made a final pitch. <br /> <br /> The last time we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a man paradox, because the bomb was going to leave today. His toys are a music box shaped like a gun and a box of pencils. Now what is so wrong? The pens and pencils drew so many planes of weapons that their death count exceeds the atomic bomb. And making music from a weapon? The deceived selfish generals make music with guns. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> The way I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator of the death of man and the closed case. And, honestly, compared to all the barbaric things that our ancestors did centuries ago, we are quite human in the painless stabbing these days. <br /> <br /> To summarize everything, I will simply quote the episode of "Firefly" "Jaynestown": "It's my estimation that every man made a statue of himself was a type of bastard or another. It's about you, Jayne, it's about what you need. "
