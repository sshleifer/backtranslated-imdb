I thought that this film was preached and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie that shows the children who fight against the system, but it does not even present a positive solution. I guess I did not really feel for the kids. I can totally understand what his complaints were and I know how poor the state of the schools is, but I found that his solution and the way the outside handled it was a lot of crazy people. If this comes on television, do not waste your time. Watch Short circuit again for 235th time.
