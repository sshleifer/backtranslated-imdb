Wow. After watching this film, you will know why young people in the United States still lack intelligence and any trait to contribute to the welfare of society, except for becoming more inept to function. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two stars in some of the most repressible people imaginable, who at their core lack any kind of talent or intelligence to do something for themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve -O), and that the only option for fame was to make a living entertaining those as stupid as they hurt. existing. A boy drinking horse semen? Only flat disgusting. A man putting a hook on his cheek and acting as "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, it is evidence of institutionalizing it. <br /> <br /> In general, I left the theater without any hope for humanity.
