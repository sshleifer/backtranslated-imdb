These rubber monsters failed in their attempt to be great, terrifying or even comical. It looks like a movie of aspiring Porkys or Animals House, but the sequences and the story are not always clear. It also can not catch your attention. The whole movie seems cheap and with an incredible bad taste, the only thing that makes you laugh is the horrible rubber monsters that must cost a dollar each, because the work or they never seem realistic, the movements and expressions make the Muppets Look like a Pixar 3D movie when compared to this one. I hope that Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this horrible film bearable, and when she dies in the film, this becomes even worse than before. A film that should only be seen in a fast forward.
