The last of the sequels of the "Airport". This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all the movies at the airport) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as the radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a journalist in search of death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as president of the airlines; Charo in a terrible "comic" bit; John Davidson as a journalist (loves how his hair stays in place even AFTER the plane is turned upside down); Poor Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying child (stop rolling her eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinetist (what did I say about not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach (OK, you can laugh at that); Bibi Andresson as a prostitute and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Full of stupid plots and dialogues that will make you roar: watch Davidson get married on the plane near the end! The Concorde is taking all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, escape, land safely in France and are taken out the next day. Do not you think the flight was canceled or something? Most of the acting is terrible: McCambridge is a sight to behold with a red wig and a horrible fake accent. The only good performance is Kennedy and Delon (with a fantastic appearance) that offers a very attractive performance. However, that is not enough for you to feel through this nonsense. Too long and lousy special effects too. This was a mega bomb and (fortunately) prevented Universal from doing it again.
