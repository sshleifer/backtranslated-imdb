This third installment of the Scarecrow series is by far the best of all. I know, I know ... but how good is it? Well, let's not be stupid. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a good movie. Again filmed in digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a baseball team puts the new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they leave it in a field of corn, tied to a scarecrow. According to the legend, the soul of the child is transferred to the body of the scarecrow, which comes alive and causes a terrible revenge, well, almost everyone. The coedu head to the beach, which is somehow very close to the corn field. On the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistle of the scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing a much-needed drama to the movie. Unfortunately, the drama jumps on the good and lands on common cheese. Much of the acting was fair, but there were some really terrible fragments, including a horrible piece of bad lip-syncing. Some points in the plot were mostly unresolved, and most were used to get someone just so they could be sacrificed. Once again, better than previous deliveries, but still missing.
