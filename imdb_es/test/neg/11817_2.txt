This is a film of poor quality. Like so many "women in chains" movies, this one is full of lesbianism. However, unlike most of the previous films, which implied this to a large extent, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a lot of skins when a horny female prison guard watches the women while they bathe and have sex with one of the internal ones. By the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft core pornographic movie, something like GIRLS GONE WILD GOES to PRISON! It is also a bad scam by THE DESFIANT ONES, although in this case they are two hot females who hate each other and are chained when they escape. While the original film is considered a classic, it can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. That's because there is no subtlety and the movie is simply cheap: cheap emotions, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black recluse with an attitude", a lady who was set up and sent to prison in this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, the two are not supported and have opposite objectives. However, given that it is driven by clich√©s, there is really no surprise in how the film ends, since both are making friends (gag me).
