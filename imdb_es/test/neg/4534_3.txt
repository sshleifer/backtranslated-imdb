This movie had some fun moments. Louie, the main character was chosen along with some other decent support characters. The first shot of the film set the tone, but the direction and the story went downhill from there. Apart from a turn at the end (interesting and fun too), I wish this film had a better direction and a more developed story. Without giving away anything of the plot, the whole idea is better! I wish it were better executed in this short film. The potential was there, but it simply did not deliver the goods.
