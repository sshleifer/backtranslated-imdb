As a big fan of the original Delta Force Operation, I thought I could continue with this movie. I thought it could not be so bad. However, here is a list of things I learned from watching Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite in the US military, are mostly overweight men. The 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite in the armed forces of the United States, carries standard police pistols or AK-47s in their most important missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite in the US military, has not learned that during stealth missions, the use of bright red ski jumpers and running in open spaces they will not keep it out of sight. <br /> <br /> - When you drop a Molotov cocktail in a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When the tank fire hits you, you can flee, although the smoke caused may appear. Small difficulties to breathe. <br /> <br /> - You can die from a standard weapon shot, but you can also live despite being hit several times by a sniper rifle, and rarely by an AK-47. <br /> <br /> - In hand-to-hand combat, members of the Delta Force, despite being the elite in the US armed forces, are regularly beaten by railroad attendants. <br /> <br /> - If the bad guys get close to you while traveling on a slow train, there's nothing to worry about: among the 4 of them, they can not imagine how to get an automatic weapon to shoot automatically. let alone hit anyone from 5 meters (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you lack actors, recycle them, the bad guy in Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy named Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the boy who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 Now he plays Skip Lang, a different kind guy. <br /> <br /> - It is not right for the Delta Force to shoot an unarmed Terrorist, even if he is trying to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - The grenades explode on impact with the ground when they are launched by members of the Delta Force. When they are launched by personnel not belonging to the Delta Force, they explode exactly at the point where members of the Delta Force threw the grenades at the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - The militias and the personal armies use exactly the same helicopter that the UN used in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy in that helicopter can not see it if you lie face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting someone several times in the chest will cause minor damage. Stabbing that person in the knee will kill them within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force steals older people's cars to travel when they are in foreign countries, because the US Army. UU It does not provide them with any means of transportation. This can also explain why they took public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best time to make movies, but it's good to laugh.
