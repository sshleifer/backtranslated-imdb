After watching Shootfighter 1 and the blood cubes that shed, I was ready for another tireless excursion of heart massage with open hands and chiropractic in a cage. But nooooooo, this was like Barney's version of the first movie, with that image of the Karate Kid. At least Bolo Yeung still kicks the booty, although he needs to make more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
