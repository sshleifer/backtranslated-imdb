WARNING!! This revision may contain spoilers. The back of the box is deceptive. He says all this shit about the children who tell ghost stories, what they do, but then it implies that everyone will be killed by some murderer in the woods. This does not happen. The stories they tell are a little interesting, specifically the dog and everything that licks, but most are pretty boring, monsters in the woods, some silent girl and the main one, the whole movie.
