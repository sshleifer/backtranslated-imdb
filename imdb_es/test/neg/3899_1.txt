I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide variety of films, and I mainly aim for his horror films, however bad they may be at times. I guess it was morbid curiosity that attracted me to this, and I was not even curious to finish it. Maybe it got better towards the end, but unless you like lesbian sex scenes (of which there are many), then you may want to move on. So what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman peeing in a bowl at the kitchen counter (while standing)? You never care what it is used for later, you probably do not want to know. If this sounds intriguing to you, then that's your problem, but maybe you like this movie. I myself, I am not rude, I have seen many disgusting movies in my day but at least they did well, and this is not the case. Sometimes too much is simply too much. Bleah
