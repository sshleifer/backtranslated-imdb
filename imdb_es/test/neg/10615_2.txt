There are films that are leaders and movies that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of his followers. <br /> <br /> "Party Camp" is as interchangeable as any of its brothers who probed the depths that "Meatballs" (the original) had exploded so successfully. Of course, that had Bill Murray. So, what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd has made these films with her bread and butter, and which dish side SHE provides! Even as an innocent girlfriend (wink, wink) to a rich twerp (Cribb), she provides that sensual steam that she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think so). My God, that smile of his could melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes, the movie. Nothing special as I said; Every cheap joke is aimed and hit (crotch level). And the eternal teenager Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there is only nudity, boring sexual jokes, more, nakedness, a sequence of soft-core dreams, a nurse of sexual symbols simply for (TENGAS!) For purposes of looks, even more naked. .. <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea Bill Murray was NOT in this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Joya, of course. Lots of "camp", but not much of a "party".
