Besides the fact that this is just a film made abysmally (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) people who think there is something "real" about this legend must grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts do not exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You really need to grow. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was committed almost 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a lot of criminals native to Tennessee believe that it does not either. Going to college. Or at least finish high school.
