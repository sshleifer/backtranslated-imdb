Well, I saw this movie waiting to roll down the corridors ... how wrong I was. The film was moderately funny, at best, and irritating at worst (the slapstick comedy style of building an ark with archaic tools, laughing ... no, I did not). I am very disappointed that Steve Carrel was the leader. I have religiously seen the US Office. UU., It cracks me enormously, I thought that the 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan 'elp us- why the hell did she accept this script? And, as for Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> Then, the idea seemed reasonable, the actors in whom I had a lot of faith, but the execution was nothing short of the other world or the end, Well, it seemed as if they had run out of money, or ideas . This for me was one of the most artificial finishes I could have imagined. They took a biblical story and limited it to a cautionary tale about localized environmental problems, not even global problems, but a local bill: yawn! <br /> <br /> In short, the reasonable beginning, gradually worsened and, for me, everything had been washed off when the credit passed.
