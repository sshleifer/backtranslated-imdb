I have never seen a movie that has frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance could have been amazing. Frustrated because women could have been beautiful. How could I know ?! When your eyes have moved to the area of ​​interest on the screen and they have properly focused on the place to be admired, the insane editor has moved the image! I completely agree with the other comments here about the poor lighting and the terrible work of the camera / editor. It makes me nauseous just to watch ten minutes of this would be a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to get a front seat for the live concert and I would be there of an opportunity! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
