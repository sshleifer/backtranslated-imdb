This * should * have been an incredibly funny movie ... but it falls flat on its face. (In fact, I stopped seeing him halfway, which is something I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-class motivational speaker who was bequeathed to an elephant by his father (whom he had presumed he was dead before he was born); Then he has a week to take the heavy pachyderm across the country. Your adventures on the road are only slightly funny at best. The considerable comedic talents of Janeane Garofalo have not been exploited. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack's mother (who has many explanations to do), and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus associate of Jack's father. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but I can hardly believe it ...
