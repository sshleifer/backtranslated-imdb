A film about a French girl who is raped by street thugs. The scene of the rape itself is engraved in all its bloody details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a fit of rage, the victim grabs his friend's weapon (or was it his brother?), Shoots him and runs off with the gun. Meet this prostitute who has just seen her pimp knocked down, they are united and they are heading towards Paris. A series of crazy, senseless and savage killings continue, the girls seem to enjoy each murder more than the previous one. A poor boy is shot in the hole **** There is a good dose of sex among the many murders. <br /> <br /> The movie is not the most violent I've seen, I would say that Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence on her. If what you are looking for is violence, then there are many other movies. And if you do not like sex, then I would suggest one of those XXXs. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie because of all the enthusiasm that the media gave him. The film itself is not a big deal, just a lot of violence and sex with something like a handheld camera. I was surprised that this film had an age limit of 15 years in Sweden, if 15 year olds can see this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
