OK ... this CAN contain spoilers ... but who cares? No, if you value the seconds in your life, waste your time in this pile of garbage. There is no redeeming quality in this movie ... and I say it as a fan of the Holiday Movie Series. I LOVED Cousin Eddie's character from the other Vacation movies ... but it only works well as a supporting character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? No way. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie lacks cohesion ... the rhythm is off ... it's just plain funny. And the actor who plays the "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was horrible, more than likely due to a real lack of direction. I do not know why ... but his whole character scared me. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not in it ... That has nothing to do with that. The script, the direction, the acting ... the special effects ... everything is a train crash. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train also ran over some elderly people. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... get away from this filth! I call it junk because it messes up the name of the Vacation Franchise.
