There were some decent moments in this movie, and a couple of times where it was quite fun. However, this does not compensate for the fact that, in general, this was a tremendously boring movie. There was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this movie, and I could not understand why he would even consider leaving his future wife for this girl with whom he was supposedly eliminated. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler at Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that just did not have to be there and they were tremendously slow. <br /> <br /> This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait until it's been a year and a half in video and fix it in the .49 cents bin if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and can not think of better movies to rent.
