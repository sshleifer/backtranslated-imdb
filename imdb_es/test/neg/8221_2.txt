"Garden State" is another of these "indie" type images that supposedly skimp on production values ​​in order to give the audience a true real human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, as are the performances (of some well-known actors as well). Where the image is missing is in the script of Zach Braff, which seems mostly taken from situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you're as young as Braff, you have not lived long enough to use the Experience as a forage film. Braff's experience seems to be watching movies and then repeating the same clichés in his own movie. At Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who committed suicide after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. It seems he has no feeling about this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a strange accident when he was six years old, and has no particular dismay at having lost his mother (in fact, he attends a party just after the burial). who was invited by a friend of his, who works as a grave digger in the cemetery). Everything smells a lot of "Beautiful Girls", also about a boy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang out with his old friends, with a little "Ordinary People" thrown aside. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle that Braff can achieve anything in his life, given that his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he did not commit suicide), still live their "lives" as if they still they were in high school, celebrating with silly bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them recognizes him for his TV role as the "delayed field marshal" (the character of Natalie Portman, the most conscious person in the movie, he does it), and says things like "Hey, I remind you of Junior Year" . These guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. Even a friend, who made millions invent a silent Velcro, has no real reason to live, because his frame of reference is the high school and the party. And it does not take a lot of money to celebrate as a high school student. <br /> <br /> It is revealed that Braff is very medicated, which avoids "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, as an adult would. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a kind of lost girl, who gives funerals for pets and lives with her mother as a 10-year-old girl in a bedroom that looks like a pink dollhouse. Anyway, they fall in love, and Braff learns to "feel" again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long heart-to-heart conversation with his cold and distant father and tells him What it is and The name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the house of millionaire children, playing sensibly in front of a giant fireplace, and the part is very routine, so the movie is very common, I swear, I almost expected someone to go up and throw a sleigh to the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to have his garbage refilled, and Liebman tells him (in the hardest line of the movie) "The body can make jokes." Once I found my ex's twins. best friend in my wife's bag, and I did not have an erection for a year and a half. " Obviously, no licensed doctor would say that, but it's a malicious poem, a nod from Braff, I guess, to his losing friends to let them know he's still thinking about them, like the "37" joke in "Clerks." Kevin Smith nods to his friends in the trash. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and gets rid of the drug; The story unfolds in a predictable way. But if you are going to have a film that is wall-to-wall cliches, at least give some lovely performances to give it life. And Braff does it. He has the right kind of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the exalted Andrew real and moving, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives a big boost to the movie. With her diminutive features and flickering expressions of humor, she almost steals the photo as her traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in "Shattered Glass") is remarkable as the gravedigger friend. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can not have enough story romance in the movies, but when people start to consider it a masterpiece, they have no idea. Braff believes that you can take the same old and tired plot, write some "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and give a slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that temporizes the material. He does not
