Ok where I start A couple of weeks ago I saw a screening and I was surprised at how bad this movie is. Surely if you LOVE Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows in the air, you will definitely love this movie. I, personally, I really like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure it's great and fun to work personally, but you can not make it on the big screen. It was a nice movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 to see it? H & LL no !!!! Now that I have seen it, I would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. George, friend, I love you, but do not do more comedies? This script is missing a lot, great concept but I just did not do it.
