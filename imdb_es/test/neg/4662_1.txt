Being a relentless explosive melodrama that does not stop without stopping, this film is one of the worst action movies ever produced, and absolutely incredible in every way. The rhythm is constantly filled with fever, and all the action and the actors are trapped by total hysteria. It is almost unappealable, and a stain - no, a stain - on the careers of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated attempt at excitement weakens itself, resulting in a movie where you simply go "Come on!" all the time. Configuration and events are impossible to take even remotely. I can only rate this abomination as 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and completely absorbent. Everything Armageddon is not.
