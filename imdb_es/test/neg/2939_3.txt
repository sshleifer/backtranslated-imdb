I am quite surprised that someone has found this moving or moving film. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film struck me as an excellent, if provocative, idea for a film about an unusual kind of relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real-life examples that I have known). ) is extremely deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a low-cost script, bad script, and although it has a number of very nice images, I did not find anything special. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it's too short and badly composed to give your audience enough time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we do not really care about any of them, so their tensions and obstacles do not really touch us. <br /> <br /> I think a REMAKE, from the script to ... with some character development by some really good writers, could greatly improve it. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the screen writers took to much higher levels than the author of the script: the screen writers who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy, and carried out their task. With care, planning and excellent craftsmanship! However, people only seem to redo those films that do not need it. You're really not missing anything if you skip this one: I found it very disappointing, and it's only saved me from getting a star from me by virtue of the audacity and confusion it took to make a film about this very sensitive subject. .
