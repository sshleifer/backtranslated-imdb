Stay away from this. The worst is the dreadful story. There seems to be an intention to convey some subtle spiritual / love / friendship message, but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance that it can not help shuddering. Also, most of the screen time is a much lower story than the standard of thieves, criminals and our heroes dealing with some alien time travel artifacts. I know you're looking for problems when you deal with time, but the story is more full of holes than usual. It also has: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst musical arrangements in the history of the film, overwhelming, cheap, abrupt and disconnected. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
