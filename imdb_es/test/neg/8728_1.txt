I agree in many parts with the quite complete review already published on the subject of the miniseries, and I agree that it has its advantages, not only its cons. For example, the original film manages to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel in a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love story of Paul Atreides and Chani, who, when reading the novel, is a farce. , probably born from the study that cuts off the changenies that the other critic writes about. This was one of the great flaws of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, include many of the original story lines that were cut from the Lynch movie due to the expansive nature of Herbert's novel. <br /> <br /> However, this in itself is a double-edged sword. Instead of completing a text transfer to celluloid of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own story lines, absent from the original novel. Similarly, although this is surely a "more complete" account of Dune's story, it is also a break with the original heart and soul and the main vision: that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and demonstrate what many different characters think, without the need to suddenly change the point of view, or expand into unnecessary and forced spoken words or monologues? Gone. Much of the original agony of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or move away from it, surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that captivates people who are away from the science fiction fans.) He's lost. <br /> <br /> Without the prophecy, what is the point of Dune? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad it is that this is all that is provided to us. Lynch's movie was flawed, yes. But a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker, take on some of the best points of Lynch's filmmaking and reject some of the more exaggerated aspects of the style while restoring the plot. Now, this story will probably never be translated again for filming, and this seems heartbreaking to me.
