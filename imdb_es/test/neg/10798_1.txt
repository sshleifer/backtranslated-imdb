That was quickly destroyed by the poor quality of the acting, the cinematography, numerous meaningless scenes and a terrible villain. Well, let's see that Joe Estevez is bad (as always) but it's not the only casting problem, the writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress, in fact, well, she sucks. Your script is not so bad, it's misdirected. In fact, if the direction had been better and if better actors had been chosen, this could have been a really good movie. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, with all these problems, "Soultaker" is not even a bit passable like a horror movie, besides, the rhythm is also horrible. <br /> <br /> The MST team had fun with this but it was definitely not one of their best efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
