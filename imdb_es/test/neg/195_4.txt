I should start by saying that I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are downright garbage. So I expected hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it was not like that, it fell in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" made me smile a lot, and everything is rather old-fashioned. But the movie did not appeal to me like others have, like Rocky Horror. Although that is a bad example, since for years I hated Rocky Horror, I suddenly understood it and I have loved it ever since. Maybe the hair is the same. Although I doubt he has as much exposure as Rocky Horror because of the content of language and nudity, then I doubt he has the opportunity to make it grow on me. Gettit? Hair ... grow ... oh, get dressed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could not see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical failure, which was a shame, since I would. I liked seeing how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie for the casual movie buff, but one for music lovers. However, I really hope they do not do it again, since I believe that a new version of this type would end up in an original PC version, pale and shallow. <br /> <br /> It is worth taking a look for the lovers of the genre.
