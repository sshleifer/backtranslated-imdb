The Ten Steps basically have a reasonably good premise for a fearsome short, but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is terrible and the performance is of the kind that is often seen in Irish short films. Really really shamefully bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the basement to change the blown fuse. She telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and with a scolding voice out loud tells her that it is not ringing because dad is "trying to impress his boss". The actress who plays the boss's wife emulates with great success the bad performance of the mother when she tells them that her house is haunted. The rest of the film is that the father persuaded his daughter by the stairs on the phone. The Ten Steps employs stock techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that one would expect in a below-average horror movie. Poor.
