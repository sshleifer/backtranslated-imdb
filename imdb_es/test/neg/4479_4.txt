The only romantic thing about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance. If you are hoping that this film adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel follow the safe formula of previous films, such as "Message in a Bottle", "Nights at Rodanthe" and "A Walk to Remember", think again. Nobody dies because of an accident trying to save another person and the romance here does not transform these characters. In any case, it makes them even more miserable than they were. <br /> <br /> The soft-spoken Special Forces Army Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), has a memorable two-week adventure. on army leave with an impressionable schoolgirl, Savannah Curtis (the radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia"), who is spending Spring Break in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, she smokes, but she tells John that her head is full of blasphemies. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall madly in love and launch an interminable exchange of love letters that induce sleep by any standard. Tyree is in the world serving the military in some corner of the world abandoned by God, while she is in college reading her letters in class. Just as they are getting hot and heavy among them, suicide bombers crash planes in the World Trade Center. John rejoins his friends in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another boy, a friend of the hairy but nice family Tim (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") who has an autistic son without a mother, named Alan, becomes the object of Savannah's feeling. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. It delays what seems an eternity before finally contacting Tyree with the letter of the same name. In fact, she leaves him for a man with a disease! Later, she confesses to John that she knew that the sound of her voice would have broken her decision to marry Tim, so she does not make that fateful call. As expected, John complains about Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and ends up in Germany. While all this is happening, Tyree is trying to reach an agreement with his own coin collector father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's syndrome. It seems that his father is in his last legs after John leaves the hospital. The main female character lacks a drink of respect and her betrayal of Tyree amounts to a pretty low blow. Tyree, her father and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long-distance epistolary romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives a new meaning to lethargic love stories.
