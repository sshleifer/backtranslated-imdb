If you are a six year old boy who is interested in dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, roll your eyes every 15 seconds or so. If you want to start choosing things like acting, special effects, dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the smallest amount of sense, you have enough material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, everything will be fine. That said, there are many entertainments for children who are much smarter, and some of them are even bearable or pleasing to adults. Unless your child is in a dinosaur mood without concessions, he's probably better off looking for something else.
