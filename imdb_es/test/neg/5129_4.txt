SPOILERS, BEWARE! Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. Some things confuse me about it (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long it took to dance so well, Alex responds "about 25 years", is not Alex supposed to be 18 years old?) And some things fascinate me I loved the twists ! In general, however, I was intrigued. When this movie was made, I was not even born. I really did not experience the eighties (I was born in '85) and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex just ran a little or threw himself everywhere, he did not dance, he just hit the things, he threw it Going back and waving his arms, Was this considered "dancing" back then? If it were, I'm not sure I've endured it. The turns, the turn, the fluid movements were great, but some of them, my neighbor's little one could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, would not she be tired after a hard day's work? When she will not work for almost a week, would not she be fired? Living in a warehouse, I can almost see it, but not quite. It does not seem right that she is a welder, owns a warehouse and is trying to enter the ballet. None of that really makes sense. I should not judge too much considering my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I do not know. But in any case, they could have chosen a better actress. The actors were good. I even liked romance. You make your own decision. But mine is: fix it once, do not see it again, it's not worth it.
