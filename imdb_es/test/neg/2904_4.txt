I remember having captured this movie on one of the Showtime channels. What struck me most is that this film is completely developed in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there, so I see the places easily. <br /> <br /> In any case, a ninja kills a scientist, because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, which is pursued by the police. It takes about half of the police force to shoot him down and, when he is finally killed, there are no discernible bullet wounds. His spirit is still alive, however, when a woman finds her and touches her katana. <br /> <br /> From that moment, it is possessed and periodically kills the cops who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. This could be a plot device of the two previous films, or perhaps a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very corny, bad and entertaining. This is something to watch with a tub of popcorn, and several friends and they give you the MST3K treatment.
