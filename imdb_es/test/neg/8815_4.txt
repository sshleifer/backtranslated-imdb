I really tried to like "Saw" The story was good, and I admire the dizzying pace of the way the movie was shot. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, although they seemed "great", did not really make sense. <br /> <br /> First, what I liked about the movie was the general tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in an ungrateful role as a doctor's kidnapped wife. The scene of Shawnee Smith was amazing and both Wan and Whannell should be commended for using that scene as a demonstration to get the film's backing. The whole notion that Jigsaw's killer finds a way to kill his victims is an excellent notion, but once the movie started, logic began to escape. <br /> <br /> Once they showed that Zap was the only one holding Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was clear that he was not Jigsaw's killer, and part of it. The scene in which he places a stethoscope on the heart of the terrified Diana while Allison screams at him through his gag was one of the most gratuitous scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to be chilling, but it did not establish anything. In addition, given that the murderer Jigsaw finds a way for the victims to commit suicide, he has no problem cutting the throat of a police officer. I suppose it is a way of showing that he does not want to be caught and that he will go through all the necessary means to make sure that does not happen, but for me he had no logic, especially when he does not show any remorse. the death of another detective (who liked that configuration, it would only have been better if he had given it to someone who really deserved it). <br /> <br /> I felt that Leigh Whannell was fine as Adam. It was not really a striking role and has great potential as a character actor. However, I did not like James Wan's address too much. The story may have been original, but the safe address was not. I guess I'm tired of MTV's style being reduced in favor of the old management approach, but many scenes involving the Jigsaw killer remind me too much of "Se7en", too. As the film progressed, for me it was starting to become a series of demos like "Hey, look what I can do". Instead of being intriguing, it became a great distraction. But hey, it worked. He is now directing "Final Destination 3," which is why he is on the road to a successful career, and I believe he will become a top-notch horror director for years to come. <br /> <br /> What really helped me. the end. As I said, I knew that Jigsaw was not Zap, and I liked how Adam discovered the mini tape player after killing it. It would have had a terrible ending, except for one fatal flaw: I felt they should have left it where you did not know who the killer was. The way it was done was done only for one reason: boy, are we smart? UH no. For me, it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the best horror movies are made for a reason, where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story. While "Saw" began very well, it began to get rid of the insatiable need for filmmakers to be "cool" and detract from the winning story they had. Maybe if they were not so insistent on making the films themselves, and they would trust a more experienced horror director to manage it, I think it would have been the horror classic that has been delivered in the last four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I am very scared.
