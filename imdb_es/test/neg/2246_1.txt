Hooray for the misspelling title! After reading reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a piece of trash. This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans. I wish it were made in a nitrate film and all the copies carefully stacked under a chain-smoking Tarantino fan. The violence, literally unnecessary, the holes in the plot, Tarantino's table, without drama, and the absent development of the characters, made this a glorified and painful montage. <br /> <br /> What acted there? And how much of that was just because he was too busy reading the subtitles? I see my part of the anime admired, and congratulations for the attempt at authenticity, but it was exaggerated for an English movie. With the evident historical deficiencies, the constant reading finished what happened there. <br /> <br /> Why pay money for a narrator who will have no link with any of the characters, the plot, the themes, the scenario or anything involved? in the film? When the film needs that kind of explanation, it presages the filth that follows. <br /> <br /> Historical investigation: while it was dotted with interesting facts, it used the appropriate suits and accessories for the soldiers, this film spread the truth beyond belief, even for historical fiction. Kudos in Mata Hari's reference, although using it as a prefiguration was a bit too much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not strangled in an isolated room. This ruined the meaning that the reference might have had. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen tributes to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Taking into account the audience, all these and other references were completely lost in many who bothered to watch this movie, and in all those who would enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I am confused by your choices of when to start a scene, finish it, and what to include. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take almost 20 minutes to set some kind of testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I think was the message was trite. The idea of ​​rats and how we act in a primordial nature against them, and "who is the rat?" They were at best clichéd, but at worst they did not notice. The mention of American camps for the Japanese and American Germans would have added legitimacy to this question in the moral realm. Literally, all the characters in the film who have a speaking role were caught in their own legend. Is that the world in which Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see this one. I'm sorry to have bothered to see you, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none was realized.
