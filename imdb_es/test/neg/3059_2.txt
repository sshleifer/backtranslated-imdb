When this movie premiered in 1996, director Mark Lester had been making small, tight-fitting B-action movies for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the great "Truck Stop Women" of the 70s and several other small gems; unfortunately, he is also responsible for this error. It's a shame to see Theresa Russell, a talented, and still smoking, wasted once more, but is still the best actress in this photo. Eric Roberts appears for a while, does his thing with Eric Roberts, then leaves, something that is not entirely undesirable in a photo with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone is not really bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how pathetic this image is. As other reviewers have mentioned, the action scenes, which is why an image like this is done in the first place, are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, as well as being somewhat inept. Apart from some "vintage" clothes and some old cars, there is no feeling for the 1930s, the time when this film is developed. A dash of by-the-numbers with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracy; This is not a documentary, of course, but the filmmakers could have been TRIED at least a little bit of authenticity, and performances ranging from grade B to elementary school relegate this small and cheap quickie in the Sunday schedule to the 4:00 am on HBO, which is just where I saw it.
