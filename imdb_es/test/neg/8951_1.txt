Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the last 10 years. The script of James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's partner, is written as pathetically as Wesley Crusher in Star Trek TNG, and is played with such conviction. <br /> <br /> In this program, people do not respond in the way people respond to things in real life: they are all polarized; all are good or completely bad (unless Walker has a 2 minute conversation with them and then change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are. This show has no place in this reality. <br /> <br /> The lines of the plot are as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show in which an arrogant old woman can simply enter people's homes without getting angry, and She can demand that officers police do what she wants and they lean backwards for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys," acts like he's the kind of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time doubles as he pleases. The lines that sometimes come out of the mouth of the people in this show are more than ridiculous. It's as if the scriptwriter on the part of Wesley Crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter of the most entertaining home videos of Bob Saget (for the "humor" parts) will come together and write all the scripts for this program . <Br /> <br /> This program is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It is for the elderly. It is for thinkers. It is for people who want to have the guarantee of always having a happy ending. It is for people who want to get away in oblivion. It's for people whose drug of choice is your television. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a commercial for this program, I shudder. My opinion is that it is THE worst program on television in the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> I used to like Chuck Norris, but this program has always stained it in my mind. I can not even watch your older movies without thinking about this program.
