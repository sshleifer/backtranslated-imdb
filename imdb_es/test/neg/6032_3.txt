Very cliched. Pretty corny. The performance gets worse as the show goes on. Do not believe anything that people say about the "realism" that this film should represent. It's just a shoot'em up. An interesting twist in the fact that the VC that tied the base was given a human face and was not described as a badly incarnated.
