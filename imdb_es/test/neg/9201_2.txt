I say that Ben Johnson and my Canadian compatriots say: "Ben Johnson?" - He was a cursed MOVIE STAR guy, a COWBOY, and in 1976 he was playing a sheriff in great TV movies like this, taking advantage of MANY KILLER BAD BEES that apparently everyone thought they were going to get. us in the moment So there are these bees, and they kill some people flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually, these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car all over the swarm. The cops are like, what do we do? Uh, the bees die when it's cold. So, where can we get cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So they drive this car and its swarm of killer bees over and over through the streets of New Orleans, with a megaphone that says "TAKE OFF THE STREETS OR IT WILL BE PUT IN DEATH." And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with their broken toilets thus becomes the narcotic fate of this buncha bee in particular. I do not know what is the greatest indignity in this great city ... well, yes, but it also stinks. More adequately seen in a 16mm print extremely discolored to orange, although Betamax is a good alternative!
