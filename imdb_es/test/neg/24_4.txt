"Bloody Birthday" is a strange and, at times, humorous and low budget horror movie, like "Mikey" or a less intelligent version of "The Good Son". <br /> <br /> Located in a small Californian. In the city, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where the planetary alignment means that somehow they are born without emotion. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths commit suicide, eliminating their parents, siblings, teachers and any other person who irritates them. Only a teenager knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation of why babies around the world who are born at the same time are not so twisted, but that's it! <br /> <br /> For a slasher movie, it is very docile in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose highlights the problem of choosing child characters as murderers, since there are only so many things that you can expose to the young actors. Instead, it's fun and a little disturbing to see three 10-year-olds planning murders and carrying out their plans with guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why it does not descend to be totally ridiculous is because the children's actors are very convincing in their roles because of the way they interpret the little innocents in front of adults who are not interested in showing their dark side to the girl who know the truth <br /> <br /> 'Bloody Birthday' is quite mediocre like a horror movie, with little shock and little blood, but since it has the impact factor of having children as murderers, it is a bit unique in that way. One to see if there is nothing else in.
