I will not comment much, why? Stereotyped characters, absolute ignorance about the reality of Colombia, horrible staging, bad choice of colors, it's NOT fun (it's supposed to be a comedy and they expect you to laugh because some distant music is beside the pointless scenes) , direction of very poor actors If you see these people somewhere, I mean the interpreters, you know that at least they are good, but seeing this, call the film, it is impossible to guess, you get tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm is the rap song in the final credits ... pathetic, is not it? etc ... etc ... I have not seen such a bad movie for a long time!
