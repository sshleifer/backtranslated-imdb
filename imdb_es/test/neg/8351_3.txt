'Volcano' is, at best, a B-movie, and in the worst case it's more of a disaster than what it's supposed to be representing. To be fair, you must be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for an important concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the main person in charge of the Emergency Management Office of the Office of Emergency Management. It's fine when you're not stuck with the stupid dialogue that the script provides. However, Anne Heche gives an incredibly bad performance as an intelligent geologist who becomes the love interest of Roark (while the city is burning, of course). Gaby Hoffman moves from Field of Dreams and American President to a shift as a crying, needy daughter and lifelong victim of Jones. Don Cheadle can sit in a really nice office and take care of Jones' phone calls, doing the work that Roark would and should be doing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie really starts to go downhill when Heche's geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while they're breaking up on the subway lines. It accelerates when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to stop the flow of lava flowing down the street, Heche's geologist (who loves to teach everyone about the science of geology) apparently does not realize the fact that the lava is hot and melts metal and rock, and it is unlikely that a dead bus has much effect. It really begins to suck when the film presents the racial tension of Rodney King between two bad actors disguised as policemen and an angry black man who can not understand why the fire department is busy with this great river of flowing lava. But hey, in the end, the three of you will work together to build a K-rail dam to keep the lava from eating your neighborhood, even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used would not stop washing anyway Also, the K rails are not waterproof, but I think that lava does not think of sticking its head in the holes, not when Tommy Lee Jones is looking at it. I do not even mean the subparcel of wagons of the stranded subway, where a tunnel full of hot lava is going down but, curiously, it is not too hot to try a rescue, there is not much smoke to see, and there is no poisonous gas to everyone can breathe. This must be LA Lava, or Lava Lite. You know, eat cars but it's green. <br /> <br /> There are camp moments here that almost make you wonder if this was a comedy. For example, the two security guards who pack the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch have a completely absurd and absurd conversation about weight, and in the end, as soon as little Roark / Jones rescued the note that they all look the same while they are covered of ash, that the storm bursts and cleanses everyone, and then the sun rises and Heche says something like "aw, shucks, Roark." <br /> <br /> 'Volcano' almost achieves battlefield status on Earth, but with the exception of Heche, no one approaches Travolta's evil and the technical aspects are handled quite well. If you are from the Los Angeles area as I am, it's funny to think that a lava flow ends with Wilshire Boulevard. I gave him a three for the effects and the little tension you get from this.
