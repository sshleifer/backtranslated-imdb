Well, Chuck Norris has appeared in many entertaining films over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even bother trying to get into the plot about a Bible shipment that went wrong. The "acting" of the main characters is so similar to wood, Pinocchio would have done a better job! The synth-based sound track is even worse than Deathstalker's. While creepy, traditionally low-budget films often try to catch their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, this is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious jumbo mambo at the viewer. The plot is reduced to different versions of the Bible.
