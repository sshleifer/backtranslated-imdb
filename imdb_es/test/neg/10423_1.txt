I saw this movie in the cinema. I was taking classes in Second City Chicago and, of course, the bustle of this movie was intense. It's a Woodward movie about one of the native children of Second City. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about John's story. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that tradition did not make him particularly friendly with women in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. The man led his life and was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and the tradition also states that he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. All right. Forget the idea that poor Michael Chilklis (who is really a great actor) is in a really amazing movie, and really only relegated to make a personification of man. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of Belushi's works ... and all the SNL scenes they portrayed in the film never happened. <br /> <br /> Teach the idea that half of the historical information in the movie did not even follow Bob Woodwards' work. A little saying, "It's okay ... we're about to get involved with Belushi ... now we're also going for Woodward ..." They also decided to take the premise of It's a wonderful life and turn it into a horrible life in Crack. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball machine the devil's auxiliary electronic device ... how many different endings can you add to a movie? It's one of those movies after it ends ... you look at the person you're with and with astonished disbelief says "What the hell was that ?!" In some circles, this movie has become a cult classic. But for a good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult classic that you sit around the screen and teases (or strips a quick liner) to the screen. A cult movie is never good. And most people would never see them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some classic evil of the 80s, drugged? Cable rental. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information from the walls of Second City Chicago than from this film.
