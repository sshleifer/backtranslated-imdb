The only reason why someone remembers this smoldering load of fecal matter is because it was written down by Pink Floyd. (Or as they were known at the time, "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really annoying Eurotrash hiker, hooks up with the American model Estelle and they advance to undress throughout the film ... <br /> <br /> And the point of this is, what exactly? What drugs are bad? Or just the heroine (horse) is? The problem is that he does not care about the characters and, in fact, not even Pink Floyd was given their best work. When Steffan has an overdose at the end, you're almost glad to get rid of him because he was so upset.
