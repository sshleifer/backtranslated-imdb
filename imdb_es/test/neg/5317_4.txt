Surprising and stupid laughter of the ex-talented John Hughes, who will soon make a movie with the sperm of 'Mira quien hablar' if his stars become younger. Recycle the formula 'Home Alone' once again to produce this idiotic comedy, in which a baby moves through Chicago while the inept kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to catch him, and along the way they endure many slapings. If Mantegna and Pantoliano can not find a laugh somewhere in your movie, then you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is most evident in scenes where crowds of people do not notice a baby crawling on the sidewalk. Absolute nonsense.
