Yes ... that's what the station renounces after the commercials of this program "some scenes can bother some spectators". <br /> <br /> It's more than disturbing. The validation of all this deployment of ego framing and chauvinism is in the fact that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes ... a true and true comedy. A JOKE. Seeing these "beaches" through their rigid farce really explains what is wrong with society. Especially the bar scene of the meat market. Both sides, male and female, are equally weak and desperate to mingle in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those plastic coke scenes sponsored by the cigarette corporation. These people have a choice, and that is what makes it even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> These rick slick try too hard. They shine with their own slot grease. It's okay. It is a videotaped lesson for the new generation of how NOT to focus on a possible interest of the heart. Hopefully that facade collapses along with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is, who is in line after these characters vanish? Do the bastard children of one night stand up?
