The title, though singular, will no doubt remind fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic horror about a lot of circus fans and how the outside world misunderstood them. However, I can assure you that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even the art of professional cinematography in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it is raw, disturbing and stimulating despite the low values ​​of budget production. Yeah sure?? The person who recommended it to me can now be considered my personal enemy! The low budget factor is correct, but that sums it up. "Freak" is terribly slow, it's badly done and every character that appears is absolutely unbearable, and that also includes the freak. Two brothers on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and heads to the house where he killed his mother at age 9. This could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated filming locations but, instead, Tyler Sharpe decided to turn it into a boring and meaningless family drama. The main actress' attempts to appear emotionally devastated are quite ridiculous and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be attributed to the limited budget. Total failure!
