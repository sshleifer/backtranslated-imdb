My paraphrase above the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this movie was much more horrible than horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in all the time I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was Tom Cruise's version. The ridiculously crude special effects on the menu screen should have warned us. The gratuitous nudity that was already in the initial scene made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the film progressed, we were affected by a clumsy performance, both excessive and low performance, and not continuity in the direction. and editing, trite writing, and raw special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; After starting this wrong, I could not improve. <br /> <br /> As contempt for the reviews that criticize a product without giving details, here are some examples of the especially uncomfortable moments of the film, even if it is spoilers. : <br /> <br /> - The protagonist says goodbye to his eldest son, since the latter is about to scare away with his mother, the latter is thorny because it is their wedding anniversary, but the protagonist is not arriving due to sudden business The son asks, very worried, "will I see you again?" Perhaps it is supposed to be a premonition, but instead it is presented as incongruous behavior for a child of that age in that situation. <br /> <br /> - A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to the ground and sits in a huge crater. A crowd of people stops nearby, looking at her uneasily but, otherwise, it seems that it is not relieved. A woman finally says "it's gi-normous!" <br /> <br /> - After this boat has destroyed a town and its inhabitants, the leader and a bystander, now only near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, exchange something like this, in a quiet and bewildered tone: <br /> <br /> "What was that thing, anyway?" "I do not know ..." <br /> <br /> - A crowd trying to evacuate on a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive, the crowd begins to flee, apparently only because a director told him to and not because he is scared or in real danger, much less in unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> And so on ... writing about the movie does not come to the experience of actually seeing it. But, please, PLEASE, save yourself the trouble, even if your morbid curiosity has awakened! The movie is so bad that you can not even enjoy it as unintentional humor (instead of, say, "Solomon & Sheeba" by King Vidor starring Yul Brynner with a wig). Life is too short to be wasted seeing such nonsense. There must be something more productive and fun to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a bird cage.
