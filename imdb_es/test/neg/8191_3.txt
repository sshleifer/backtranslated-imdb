I accidentally came across this movie when I was looking for something to watch while I was having lunch. In fact, I went to the WE network because I said I had the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of "hitting" a gymnastics team. I thought about the quality of the cheese. Well, I have cheese well. <br /> <br /> First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, most of them recapitulated quite quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and I will monitor her in almost everything. She is so pretty, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always. She looks very good throughout this movie, and it really does not age any more than it seems to be more than a decade. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt bad for the actors while watching this movie. Everyone tried to sell their parts, but they were all so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father of Dharma & Greg) in this. <br /> <br /> But writing was not the worst part of this movie. Approximately half an hour before the end, his mother dies, and when they show the tombstone, the date of death is 1979. Having lost the beginning, I had given the impression of the wardrobe that this was happening in the 80s. There is no leisure suit or bell in sight. What a shame the person who made costumes for this movie! Do not get me wrong, all the costumes in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong during the period. It almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: good to laugh or to feed a Jennie Garth person. :)
