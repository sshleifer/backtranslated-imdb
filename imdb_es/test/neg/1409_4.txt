I was aware of the critical reviews of Man of the Year, but I was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because I know that good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded premiere program of the fall months. <br /> <br /> What I discovered was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. Surprising is an understatement considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (shown in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and the obvious comic gifts of Robin Williams. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underutilized. In the film "Making Of" that comes with the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he sometimes let Robin Williams improvise the script, as if it were a bad secret of him. Are you really that stupid, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for your comic skills (basically, all the movies you've been in, other than Insomnia or One Hour Photo), do not enclose it within a script. Leave it ad-lib whatever you want, because it is the most fun that anyone else can write for him and his irrepressible comic comments can raise the level of any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more disconcerting in his lack of use of Robin Williams was that in 1987, Levinson used this exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam, injecting Robin Williams' comedy bursts into a picture of war to make a resounding match politician. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the movie is not a laughing party as it could be and it feels uncomfortably lost in its tone. If the film had the potential to work as such, I could have done one of those thrillers of the mid-90s in the style of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive or one of those Jack Ryan movies. His plot centered on an employee of a Silicon Valley company who discovered a technical problem in a system that reveals that the country chose the wrong president and the CEOs' efforts to eliminate it before the secret is revealed, so if he replaces Robin Williams with Harrison - The Ford-type actor, or maybe Harrison Ford himself, added a couple more explosions, and maybe that's where the movie tried to go. I will never really know and it is not worth trying to find out.
