I saw this movie 2 weeks before I went on a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was really just to put my mind in mode for my vacation. The movie features some sweet snowboarding skills, throughout the movies in the action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching the extreme sports channel. Unfortunately, the story was downright horrible, the acting was generally good, with a fairly small cast. This movie is apparently comedy, at least it tries to be comical, but it seems that the comedy and the story was written by a teenager. The story lacks depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be more than a little giggle a few times during the movie. It might be worthwhile to rent just to see the action of snowboarding, but again there are many films out there that are totally dedicated to snowboarding acrobatics and do not present a poorly written history of the UN.
