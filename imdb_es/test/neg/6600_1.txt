I'm speechless, I honestly can not understand how anyone could have accepted a script like this, cast anyone in the film and much less direct it. The fact that I'm writing this review seems to me an insult to my fingers, this movie should be thrown into the dumpster instead of checked. I am disappointed with Flex Alexander for even thinking about accepting a POOR EXCUSE FOR A WRITER, let alone rehearsing the paper. OMG! I think I just insulted the word "essay" ... yes, I did. You know what, the less said about this nonsense, the better. You have been warned, nobody warned me that I also had to experience horror. SEE YOUR OWN RISK.
