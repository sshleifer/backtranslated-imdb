The opening scene really made me watch the movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later, I was already pulling my eyes out. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the performance could have been better for a group of mentally handicapped people. The highlight of this movie was that there was a white punk dwarf. However, I did not fully understand how a white dwarf was the son of two African-Americans. But I suppose everything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure I added something artistic. In general, I would strongly recommend that you jump off a cliff before renting this movie.
