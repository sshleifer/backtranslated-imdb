A CBS radio program entitled "We the People" helps find a US home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (like Karl Braun), an expert surgeon and swimming pool handler. He arrives with the beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who is "studying" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern town, they are greeted at the station by the stocky John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Mrs. Gurie is unhappy in the dumpster and wants to leave. Immediately. But, the possibility of an affair with Mr. Wayne could change his mind ... <br /> <br /> God responds to citizens' prayers for rain, but it may not be enough to save the agricultural people . It is recommended that the entire city move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and resist. Coburn receives an invitation to work at one of the best clinics. And, Gurie learns that her fianc√©, presumably dead, will come to claim her as his wife. She feels compelled to accept; but, he has a dark secret ... This movie does not flatter Wayne, who seems to be very far from his element. Being paired with Gurie, promoted as another Garbo, does not help. They have a nice scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, an Italian car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
