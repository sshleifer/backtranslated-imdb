This movie was a disaster that I reimbursed my friends whom I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see him was that my friend was an apprentice editor of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie was meant to be a camper, but the approach was so clumsy and aggressive. Self-reflective turned out very flat. Judd Nelson plays a obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is a hell and made worse by his obnoxious and dominant partner Bill Paxton (for whom I feel shame, this was a really insipid role for a talented actor). A strange accident alters the course of Nelson's career and chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> The humorous attempts were cheesy, predictable and, often, tasteless and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty, but adds nothing, comically or otherwise. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very weak and non-creative attempt at camp humor that reverts like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh at Plan 9 from outer space. This makes you wonder who thought this was an idea good enough to finance and film. One of the worst bombs of all time you've ever witnessed.
