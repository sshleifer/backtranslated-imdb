SPOILERS IN ALL: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film differed completely from the book (not that the book was exactly a classic, but it really was very good). <br /> <br /> I guess Demi Moore was fine. Actually, I do not remember much of his performance in one way or another. However, the big disappointment was not with Mrs. Moore. <br /> <br /> WHY did the one who did the rewriting suddenly decided to make the millionaire have a heart? (I refer to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie and then in the book version, just another change). <br /> <br /> The people who did not read the book obviously won. I do not know anything different, but in the BOOK version, this guy is much more ruthless and complex in general. It is also fascinating. The fact that there has been such a big change in the film alters the whole plot. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that MANY movies vary a lot from books. But I also thought that Redford's character was a bit weak. This is no fault of Redford (he's a great actor and could have acted without pity), but without those qualities becomes another man dazzled love, therefore, history becomes another love story cliche 1 woman 2 men. That was not really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> This could have been much better. Even if I had not read the book version, I would not have liked this much, but changing so much definitely takes away, some points.
