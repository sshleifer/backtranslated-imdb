The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can not believe the amount of nonsense that this program presents: the characters are shallow, misguided and clumsy. <br /> <br /> It's a CSI from a poor man. Or really, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails due to the lack of the director who has not been able to extract the essence of the actors' show. It is really sad to see a show throw everything when it could have been a downhill show with just one more thoughtful pinch. From the beginning, you have the feeling of how awkward the acting is. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: do not waste your time with Bones.
