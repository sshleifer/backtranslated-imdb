Given the incredible reviews of this film, I expected something truly exceptional. It certainly starts well with an ingenious and sharp dialogue, and an excellent cast in its place. A series of stories interwoven in the style of Robert Altman provoke the viewer some convincing scenes. I found it entertaining until the second half of the movie when, unfortunately, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ridiculous coincidences and direct messages accumulate until I feel deeply disappointed and I wonder what all this fuss is about. Paul Haggis has addressed the issue of race in Los Angeles, and that only seems to have raised this film to a new level of interest. Since most of the Academy's voters live in Los Angeles and have experienced racism to some degree, this film will surely have an impact on them. That means that the Oscar for the best film will go to the gay movie or movie. Hopefully the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece of good faith that deserves recognition.
