John Wayne's staunchest worshipers will shudder when they see The Lawless Frontier. Even for a study of the poverty line, this is a stinkeroo. <br /> <br /> Unusual for a western, we have a criminal who is a perpetrator of sexual crimes. Earl Dwire plays a white and Indian mestizo who, for reasons that are not explained, pretends that it is a Mexican accent, hokey and everything. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of the advertising fame of his time. <br /> <br /> He and his gang run into Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really do not have anything worth stealing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and take her. She hears the evil fate she has in the store and she and Hayes run away from the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they meet John Wayne who is on the bandits track. They also run into a very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bandits. Once again, for reasons I can not understand. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way to make a living with horse operas like you are for the Duke. Fortunately, better things were on the way.
