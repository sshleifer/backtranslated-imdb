I have an affection for these turns in the British social norms and it is rare that I get lost. But our Betters lost me a little. It's a story about social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules, but I personally found it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the Duchess, although she complains too much and Constance Bennett kindly plays the role of Lady Greyston, a role that Bette Davis could have played backwards. <br /> <br /> But the film comes to life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. It is very lively and fun (and in truth it probably uses more makeup than Lady Greyston). He gets the last line of the movie and it's a gas!
