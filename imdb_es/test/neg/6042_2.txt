Someone said that WEBS is very much like an episode of SLIDERS, and I agree. Spoilers: I've never liked actors in Sliders, and I've rarely seen them, except when there was nothing better. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no other options. Read a book. WEBS has that kind of television actors that seem to be there as part of their PROBATION or Labor Release Program. Some low-budget television movies have actors who at least seem enthusiastic. The actors on WEBS seem to be paying them a minimum wage and they were working on a time clock. They have that desperate look, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce." The queen spider looks very good, except that it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no cobwebs). The queen spider bites people and they become spider zombies, which means they try to keep their eyes open when attacking humans. All humans are fighting with each other for a number of different reasons, and they are not sympathetic. After meeting all the "humans", I would have recommended the school of charm for the characters. All that WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was insensitive to the characters, and I expected some interesting gore and special effects. Blood was minimal, and special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen, which looked good. If WEBS had a group of Spider Creatures eating humans, it would have been more entertaining. Apparently they could only budget for "zombie spiders". WEBS is a sad entry into the field of films oriented to SPIDER. It can be called Spider's worst movie, because the eight-legged Freaks had great special effects.
