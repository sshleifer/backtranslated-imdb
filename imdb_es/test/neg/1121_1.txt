It makes the fourth theatrical premiere (the one that National Lampoon has removed its name) look like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize a franchise that was once proud. Painfully extravagant and can not be seen ... even for a television movie! The character of Cousin Eddie has become less and less fun, from the original holiday when it was cool and unique, to the Christmas holidays when it started to get a little thinner, to Vegas Vacation, where it was really annoying to see them on screen ( but, to be fair, there were MANY things that were annoying to see on screen in that movie!). But this attempt to make the character advance towards the main state is unfortunate to say the least. The Vacation movies had a horrible death in Las Vegas, and this hope of reviving even the thinnest thread of the television series was completely wrong. Chevy Chase and company put together a great trilogy when it was at its best; Now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A small note of interest: the original Audrey Griswold, Dana Barron, the first of the four actresses to play the role, including Juliette Lewis, returns to the role 20 years later, leaving only one question: WHY?)
