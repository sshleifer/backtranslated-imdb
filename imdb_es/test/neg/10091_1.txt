Maybe it was the fact of having seen Spider-man the day before Duces Wild, but I do not think there can be any excuse for this movie to be as bad as it was before. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed that once they met with a decent cast they had to try to fit in the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was, at best, quite schematic. I left wondering why I spent my money on this movie.
