This movie was terrible ... How can anyone even think that this movie was like the "old days" when Tim Thomerson was not even in it? And to make matters worse, they used clips from old trancer movies. That is simply terrible. NO trancer movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon movies, and I've been watching them since I was 4 years old. I've gone through everything they've done and this movie almost makes me lose it. Now I have a couple of lines to fill, so I'll keep going. His way of creating new trancers is completely stupid, as well as how to send Jack to the past. What happened to the TCL Chamber. And finally! What happened at the end of the trancers 5 where Lina says and I quote "Jack has given me something special" And she and other general looks to her stomach. I do not know ... maybe a BABY is there. There were many other places to go, but the full moon was in bed.
