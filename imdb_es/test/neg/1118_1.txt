I am speechless. Matty Simmons has managed to do something he thought was impossible. He has made "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" look like "Citizen Kane". Painful can not even begin to describe this piece of ... I do not know. Mind you, the premise sounded funny, but now that I've seen it, it's funny in the way that dropping an anvil in your scrotum is funny. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to describe the premise. as the title says it all, if only to say that I do not think there is literally a funny thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey bite. How could one of the funniest characters in the "Vacation" franchise, the sleazy white trash Eddie (Randy Quaid), turn into something so horribly funny? I never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. I also sympathized with the other actors involved in this "comic" atrocity, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long-suffering wife, but sunny), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the impressive Sung Hi Lee (maybe the only reason to see the movie, even if it was only with the sound off), except for that old comedian, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), had it coming. Unfortunately, the audience did not do it. I'm just saying "thank heaven" that Chevy Chase, who has been on a losing streak for years, avoided this splash of diarrhea, it's the smartest decision he's made in his career. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you are religious as I am, but I know that tonight I will pray to the Lord to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time I spent in front of the TV that It will never come back otherwise. <br /> <br /> Hot water burner Baby says ZERO of 10 stars (if you take a few strokes off the bong And drink the water, maybe a tenth of one star in 10)
