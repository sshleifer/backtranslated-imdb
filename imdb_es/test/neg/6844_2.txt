A cinema reopens with a bad history of past horrific murders. Of course, the bloody murders begin again. Written, directed, filmed, annotated and edited with a surprising lack of style and finesse by the singularly untalented Rick Sloane (who later dishonored celluloid a bit more with the absolutely atrocious "Hobgoblins"), this horrible punch-punching attempt in a somewhat nasty parody attack in every possible way: the terribly lethargic rhythm, the painfully static grainy cinematography (there is a stinking remnant of monotonous master photos everywhere), a redundant and annoying hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the plane (no) direction, a tediously intrusive and uneventful script, the insulting sophomoricist sense of low-key humor, the unbelieving murders, a pitifully uncompromising murderer (just a wrinkled old guy in doughy makeup), relentless and unpleasant , an unsatisfactorily abrupt ending, and the lifeless performances of a remarkably uninspired cast, ensure that the observation of this wicked fun is as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels soaked with sour vinegar. This garbage completely lacks the necessary raw charm and the sordid vigor required to be pleasant garbage. Instead, it's just an insipid, hard, snaking stiffness that never catches fire or becomes even remotely fun in a way as bad as smoking. Just a little nudity and the charming presence of Mary Woronov always reliable as a sarcastic and sarcastic secretary provide some relief from the general ruin of this lousy loser.
