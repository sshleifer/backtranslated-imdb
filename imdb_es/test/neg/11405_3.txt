In general, you can ask two questions about the low-budget horror films of the '80s and this' demonic wind' in particular. 1. Is it a good movie? No .. 2. Is it a funny movie? You bet Demon Wind is a frightfully dirty and nauseating tale, full of cheesy makeup effects and nasty violence. The story is practically non-existent and involves a group of young people who reveal the horrible secrets of one of the ancestors of the groups. Apparently, his grandparents used to live in a neighborhood of devil worship, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still dwells there. But, I have to give it to this movie. From start to finish, breathe morbidity! The diabolical nuances, the playful gore and the (relatively) decent acting together make this film rise above the mainstream, without the inspiration of the slashers of the 80s. It shows some creativity and guts (literally) where other productions from this decade they fall into routine and forgetting more easily. These creators were clearly inspired by the success of 'the Evil Dead', and perhaps even the Demons of Lamberto Bava, but what the hell! It's fun and done with a lot of enthusiasm. Although, this movie has a fairly high level of 'what the f ***' - sometimes. Especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows mix happily. And what the hell is the story of those two aspiring magicians? However, 'Demon Wind' receives my recommendation if your tastes are not too high in relation to the horror of the shit!
