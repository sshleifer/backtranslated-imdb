I bought this rental refund for $ 1.99 in Hollywood and I overpaid. I did not expect much, but I thought it would be something at least to fall asleep. I quickly noticed the very weak plot, the general overexploitation of everyone (no one talks like that, except in cartoons), and the direction apparently to which we are going to do everything possible. I know that the participants in this mess should feel very embarrassed, and I'm sure it did not help in any race. As for this 35-year-old movie buff, he has now provided a ready answer to the question of the worst movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br />
