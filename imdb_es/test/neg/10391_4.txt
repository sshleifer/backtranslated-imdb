A girl named Isobel is possessed by a demon. The local priest (who used to go out with Isobel's sister) should try to save her, but the biggest problems are with the family's suspicions about each other and not with the demon in his daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of "House" and the writer / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and I liked the second one even more, so you would think it would be a winner. Unfortunately, it seems that it was released by freshman film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I've thought about blaming the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is not original (are you trying to cash in on fans of "Emily Rose's Exorcism"?), But Wiley should have been able to do her magic. Br /> <br /> Also, you'd like to think that veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and Combs has a great role as a sheriff ... during the five minutes on screen (but I love the mustache). So, there is no help here. <br /> <br /> After watching "The Exorcist", all other exorcism movies should be compared with the classic ones by default, right? And the demonic possession in this movie did not frighten in the least. No head twists or paranormal activity at all. Only a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup. All the "demonic" things were centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you have a lot of Isobel jumping on her bed like she's a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping out of a haystack ... Yeah, it's crazy crazed Chuck E. Cheese." That unfortunately sums up the scope of the "bad" in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about relatives who fabricate accusations and scream while the possessed daughter sits in another room. -Camera, this is the movie for you. But, if you do not mind me saying it, you have a horrible taste in the movie if this is what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father who accuses a cowboy of sleeping with him. his wife (who did not, but slept with his daughter) and the veterinarian sleeping with his wife (who could have done it, but denies it). And then you have a gardener who attacks the girl possessed with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives, the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What was all that the Bible that you quoted five minutes ago did? <br /> <br /> A horrible movie of exorcism. Horrible examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad presentation of the direction after the series of films "House" became a classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley had no part in making this film shamelessly derived and not original, without inspiration. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this movie as if seeing it was a cardinal sin.
