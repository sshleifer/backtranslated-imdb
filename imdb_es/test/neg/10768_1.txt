The writers of this miniseries should have been sentenced to the guillotine. They killed a very funny story and squandered the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same. I highly recommend seeing another version of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this one.
