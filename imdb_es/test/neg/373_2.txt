I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were full of few possibilities. The performance was not so bad and the plot was not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) It was shown that the bleeding in the bandage of Charlie Falon (Sam Elliott) coming from the back of his hand while his knuckles were that bled <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective remove his murder victim from a well-lit area? This seemed very silly to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not unusually demanding with a movie but, in my humble opinion, I definitely do not recommend it.
