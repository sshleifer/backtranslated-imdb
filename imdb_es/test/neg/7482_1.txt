Carson Daly has to be the only nighttime talk show host who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! He is not funny. The writing is horrible for! All the sketches are painful to see. The new current karaoke is not fun at all, especially because it tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it! The escalator interviews are simply stupid and it goes without saying that they are not funny at all. All the jokes, especially during the monologue, are the less witty, foolish and less funny jokes that have been seen on television! I mean, every time he makes a joke about Jessica Simpson, he ends it with "because it's stupid", which cancels all the curiosity that was in the joke, which was already very low. Any child of 3 years could have invented some of the jokes and sketches that put in this excuse excuse for a show. Seriously, do not see this program, unless you're on the verge of suicide and want something that pushes you to the limit.
