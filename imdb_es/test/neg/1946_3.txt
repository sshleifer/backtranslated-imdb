The movie had an interesting surprise. Something psychologically exciting. And the creators could have finished it with good taste without turning it into another Hollywood movie that promotes homosexuality and other sexual deviations. This could have ended with a "reward", but there were other reasons behind the pen. What amazes me is that the mud hung on your face AFTER you have seen the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The Talented Mr. Ripley." Yes, of course, I'm just another puritan. This gay content marred the entire movie. I would not judge a film positively for its artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose were to promote a further political motivation, even more so.
