Well, let's break it down. Why is this one of the worst movies in history? Because there are so many answers to that question, I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker world? Mr. Honkee? The part with the Arab boy? it's just horrible, I really did not care about all the shit about white racism, but when they did that with Arabic, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It really is not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even funny-bad that was my first interpretation. I hope that the person who directed this film does not commit suicide, but it seems probable, I do not see any other option. NEVER see this movie, if you see it, you can not say that you died without regrets.
