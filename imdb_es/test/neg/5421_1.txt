Oh boy! I really wrecked Manhunt in space. I think this flop qualifies deservedly as Manhunt. It's not going anywhere and the mushroom growth was more exciting than this gut. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. She is so misunderstood Smug Rocky strutting and, fortunately, Winky does not mention her "gay nightlife". There's a lot more to talk about, a really horrible space marriage (to see) on rocks and shit spatial effects cuts. So, there's Bobby. You decide who is more annoying: Bobby or the Winkster? Personally, I would throw them from a hatch into a black hole before subjecting them to carnivorous alien mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vena. She is just a cosmic girl!
