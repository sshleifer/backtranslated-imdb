Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day, in the streets of Athens, a film director met a prostitute and decided that the world only had to know its history because ... you know ... it's private .. and he takes off his shirt a lot and so on. <br /> <br /> This movie is the result of its revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist ... but, of course, full of handsome guys with their chests showing up. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, then enjoy it, if you do not avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> I'm discouraged to go to Greece, that's for sure.
