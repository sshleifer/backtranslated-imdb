I watched an hour of this movie (against my will) and I could not finish it. I rate it with a 0. The writing was bad, the plot predictable and one that has been done too many times. The most annoying part of this movie was the performance of Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not require someone to look like a snob, but in all the scenes I saw he looked like a snob (bitter) or someone who was about to say something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two romances that seemed to become something serious almost at the meeting of the couples were too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching movies for TV. If there is absolutely nothing on TV and this is the only option, read a book.
