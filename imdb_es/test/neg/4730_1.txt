Mmmm, a previous summary says: "If you like aliens and predators, you will enjoy this movie" I could not disagree more, this film does not respect its weight lineage and has reduced two of the most beloved sci-fi series to Little more than a teen horror movie, has no tension or foreboding in the extraterrestrial movies or previous predators and there is no discernible main character, I really did not care about any of the characters and positively longed to see the stereotype of the cast die As soon as possible, in the vain hope that something better will replace them, really superhuman incompetence is needed for two of the most fearsome creatures invented positively fail to make an exciting and exciting film, just look at this if you want see how NOT to do it .
