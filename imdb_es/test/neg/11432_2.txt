The filmmakers did their best to find ONLY the following demographics: Palestinians with an appearance of goodwill seeking a solution to the peace, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children) who are especially bothered by security. fence, and Israelis who do not believe in the security fence, sympathize greatly with its alleged effect on Palestinians, and consider it unnecessarily divisive and / or a waste of money. Oh yes, they put a member of the Israeli government who supports the fence, but they do what they can to interpret it as inhuman and indifferent, and they ask very important questions that are really statements (for example, "The wall is bad". the environment ... is destroying everything "). <br /> <br /> I do not have any problem with (well, most) of this being presented in the film, no matter how much I disagree with people They interview, their opinions are valid enough for a documentary, HOWEVER: there are at least two sides to the issue of Israel's security fence, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that it is having a general positive influence, this "documentary" "does not present the opinion of a single person. They even go so far as to interview an Israeli Jew who claims that "all Israelis support the fence" and, therefore, are crazy, and then stubbornly refuse to interview even such an "insane" Israeli. Oh, and to top it all off, they set the tone of the film by interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (truly exceptions to the rule, I've been there) who are laughing at their Arab neighbors around the world. fence. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores a subject and presents a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is a PROPAGANDA MOVIE that is not badly made and that, very clearly, offers a battery of support for only one side of a hotly contested, emotionally and politically charged issue. It is no more a documentary than, for example, Fahrenheit 9/11.
