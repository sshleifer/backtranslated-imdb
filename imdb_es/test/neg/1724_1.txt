This is complete bullshit, do not look at the main character because the king is so worried that the air raid shelter is not big enough for everyone. Thinking twice and beating people near death too, the main character is a small selfish drunk, because because of him, the doctor who made the shelter died and his friend died. He also killed several unnamed cops. The main character is just a silly foolish king. If you do not have a concept of the greater good, this movie does not make any sense. Tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity. (If you say gravity, I'm going to rape, because the comet is smaller than the moon and you do not see the moon that causes volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and avalanches). <br /> <br /> Why does it cause a comet? Atmospheric discharges (the red ray, too, why is it red?) Also, if you do not know, THE MOONS OF THE FUCKY KING HAVE BEEN LINKED FOR THOUSANDS OF TIMES! That's why there are four craters everywhere on the moon. the size of an object necessary to destroy the moon in the fragments, as shown in the film, would require a comet the size of the moon itself. <br /> <br /> Large amounts of KE are needed to make a satellite explode like this. <br /> <br /> One mistake in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk-shaped shockwave. this is incorrect as in space, the explosion should have produced a spherical shock wave. This inaccuracy is also evident when the comet hits the moon. <br /> <br /> Also, someone tells me why the commander (the person who drives the old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die. I mean it's like walking with them to the shelter, then stop, say hello to the main character. <br /> <br /> WTF?!? !!?!? The main character is also an ugly $ $$ hole, has a huge forehead and thin hair. disgusting. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie!
