Sometimes I think that somewhere in the Canal office complex "of a lifetime" there is a room where the writer meets, with a big wheel on the wall, something like the Big Six in the casinos. The latter have many places where even money is earned, and less for higher amounts, until there may be a couple that pays more money. <br /> <br /> But I imagine that the channel wheel has about six different genres on its wheel, with two of them, most appearing, labeled "The psychotic neighbor" or "The spouse with a hidden past or a secret or both. " "Lifetime" movies have some repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The category "Husband ..." may have a long-term spouse, but a person appears, or an event occurs, stating that the good wife was once a prostitute, one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act a long time ago, or that something else in one of the antecedents is different from the presumed, etc., etc., or, as in this film, one of them has entered the marriage with the most infamous objective. <br /> <br /> A constant, in all its genres is that the husband or other men generally have no idea, vacuous, and slow to have any idea of ​​what is happening until the climax, or at the best of cases, very late in the process (unless the man is the wrongdoer). It is not the case here. <br /> <br /> If the malefactor referred to can be the "neighbor", or as in this offering, "the wife", it is always fascinating how easy, successful and effortful they are with their darday wanderings. They manipulate many of the others, beat them as necessary, assume various positions and combine more deceptions than you can count on, with infallible success until shortly before the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, like many in The Movies on this channel, is an old hand. I noticed that another movie in which he starred was titled "The Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> Finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this film dispatches those who are on their way with more experience and ease than the most experienced. and the competent "button man" in Don Corleone's family could gather. And I could not help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's character Melvin Udall for "As Good As It Gets", with his massive TOC affliction, could advise the anti-heroine to help him deal with the obsession that was the basis of this. opus.
