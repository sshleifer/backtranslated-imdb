A good idea disappointed by the hard-hand production. <br /> <br /> Much of the dialogue was unintelligible due to the sound level of the music / background, and this did not help this critic. Nor Welsh accents, sometimes quite impenetrable. Towards the end I lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film did not know whether to be a farce or a black comedy, and they require different approaches. Some of the incidents were so intense that they only deserved a groan, some were so incredible even for this kind of plot that made the story not worth following. <br /> <br /> Well, although the American just appeared as a clone of the mad scientist "Back to the future." The boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I saw him all the time, but God knows why: I do not remember having laughed once.
