Maybe it's just that it was done in 1997, or maybe whoever has managed to reach a 7 has a weakness for children with AIDS. But really the people, the maniacal laughter and the chaos during the withdrawal scene? Did not you see it coming? I'm surprised there's no baby crawling on the roof and a sick boy heading for the camera. The performance was fine, of course. But for me, this is just an example of a film from a time when situations and themes could pass into the cinematic language. Things happen, but that's all. There is no glue or motive that can be detected on the screen, which allows the subject to use preexisting emotional connections to develop the plot, without the script doing it as it is supposed.
