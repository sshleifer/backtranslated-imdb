My wife and I watched this after recording with DVR after the Encore action last week. It has to be the worst horror movie any of us has seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I were guessing the lines before we spoke), hokey special effects, a script that stretched all over the place. I think the most annoying part was the stereotype of the various characters in the plot, not to mention the free sex scene between two of the young heroines in the film, none of whom had a real purpose other than to reveal certain parts. Of its anatomy for cameras. This film should be categorized as comedy, not as horror, since the movie villains (spiders) were animated in stop motion and not believable in the least. I can not say I would have done a better job making a movie myself, but I was very amateur and it was not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie, or "f" if that's all . possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 would have to go through this!
