Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign film and remake it. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Starting with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the perfectionist obsessed with work than the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian cook and the niece who was suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, no. suitable for the upbringing of children. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and unlikely to materialize a father for the girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about that. Maybe the father could have been Puerto Rican, Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are many "guest workers" in the US UU Choose your option But I doubt that any of them would have taken responsibility as the Italian father did in the original. Therefore, the American film leaves that part out but keeps the Italian chef. And by doing this, the whole story changes. In the original, "Martha" is so far away from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece with a complete stranger in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and, therefore, the film is sweeter and does not have that advantage that the German film has. <br /> <br /> In the original, the "Italian" cook is not so attractive but much more charming, the girl is more snotty but much more credible and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman in The World today that the diluted version is presented in the American version. And all the opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and I bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood recognized that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is much better. By the way this reminds me of another remake. "Shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and totally forgettable in the American version.
