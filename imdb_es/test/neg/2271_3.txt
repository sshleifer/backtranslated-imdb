Usually, when the BBC releases a television series, one is accustomed to a certain guarantee of satisfaction. In general, the television series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust that the performance will make it worthwhile. When I came across Persuasion, here in the local library, I was expecting a pleasant evening, because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I read the story first, otherwise I would not. think very well about it. In addition, I was relieved to know that the production date of this television series was 1971, as I thought, until then, that the BBC had lost it. It's really bad, and should be used in acting schools like a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The only positive thinking I have about this series is that the people in this movie are not likely to appear or get involved in any. BBC or another product of this century apart from the young sisters Musgroves, who apparently were taking their first steps in acting, and were very well under the direction that otherwise had been given.
