I know that this movie is a low budget horror film aimed at supporters of shocks and "cheap" gore, but even considering that, this movie is too boring, full of an incoherent plot, along with horrible music and obvious signs . that this movie was never finished. <br /> <br /> Without giving spoilers, I will only say that in the last roll, things are wrapped without any explanation, either by the film or the narration. The Anitra girl is really attractive, but that is not a sufficient reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of those bloody movies of the 60s and 70s, then you should see them. but keep in mind that it does not even reach the usual plateau of this type of movies.
