The PDQ Bach did it better. Much of the spoken part of "Bach" are letters written to several customers who complain about the amount and speed of their payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, mostly about the death of children and other family matters, is a bit more interesting. The music is disconcerting: 17th century chapel orchestras and choirs that produce the sound of the 20th century concert hall. The overall quality of the production reminded me of a high-level slide show. J S Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This movie does not add anything. Netflix sent me 2 discs that did not play, so I broadcast the movie. Clearly Netflix was trying to tell me something.
