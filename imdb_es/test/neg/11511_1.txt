I do not find this show at all amusing. In fact, I think he's a lot worse than any of the other terrible comedians on the Disney channel right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting option to play Sadie, because she can not act. The jokes about this show are terribly funny, and make it even worse when the only cast member who has a little (and by that I mean little) acting talent is Justin Bradley as Hal, Sadie's brother. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo play Sadie's friends. There are really stupid and simply terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are terribly cheesy. It is a cheesy humor that only small girls find fun because their brains have not yet developed. Now I have explained my hatred for acting and horrible humor, what's next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. Did she change again (not so scientific and loving Ben) and suddenly nobody recognizes her? It's crazy In short, I hate this program, however small girls who do not have a fun concept will enjoy it, so I guess that's what they are looking for more quality. Although I can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: JUST DO NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING. <br /> <br /> My rating: horrible show. TV G. 30 minutes.
