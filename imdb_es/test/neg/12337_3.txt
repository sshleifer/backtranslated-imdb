A real disappointment, the novel is a journey of stomach so bright that it turns into madness, but this does not make sense for a television movie, it is turgid and painfully slow. Stay with Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick is lying on top of him on the cover, he should have taken the reins of it. Stacey Keach is too good as Lou Ford, and all this has the same production values ​​as the 1970s version of Planet Of The Apes. However, I recommend you go out and buy many Jim Thompson novels, in fact The Grifters is not bad, that's one of theirs, starring Jon Cusak.
