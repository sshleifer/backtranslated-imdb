Having sat and watched this movie, I can only ask myself what are the reasons for creating the film. This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life and had no redeeming characteristics. <br /> <br /> If it was supposed to be funny, it could have been a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Slow, without argument, without real action, nothing comes close to good dialogue and I have no idea of ​​the characters. What more can I say. Avoid.
