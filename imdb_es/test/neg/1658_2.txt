Teenagers aimlessly during summer vacations in a small town in Ohio can not find meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; others are content to drink and harass their companions. In a random act of arrogance fueled by alcohol, bullies mistreat a homeless man and steal a strange book. The handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. One or two nights later, one of them reads a spell and is quickly possessed. He becomes a vicious murderer and begins to silently take advantage of his former colleagues. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values ​​are low, but the filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. Little special accessories or shooting locations were needed. The performance is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the script. On the positive side, makeup special effects are surprisingly good for low budget movie standards. Despite this, the gore is minimal. Leaving aside the makeup effects, there is little for this film, even for the gore-hounds. Not recommended.
