We've all seen bad movies, well this takes the cake. I've seen that the movie box Junior looked back at me many times, from my many trips to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it seems to pay tribute to the Texas massacre, as well I thought I would get it. Error! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words, it's really bad. Although I won my prize for the most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID!!
