Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first movie has disintegrated. The story line is just horrible! I mean really, the South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands to the United States. It is simply painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! Nobody can get a South African accent, right? Or will we listen to the British or the Americans forever, making them sound like Dutch drunks? The only man who understood the Afrikaans accent well was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that upset me was when Danny Glover, so cleverly, describes an Afrikaans accent like shit. I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me throw up. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like that against diplomats, but then he sleeps with his P.A. kind! Do not waste your time watching this uninvestigated garbage. If you want to see a movie that does not completely insult a cultural group, then rent Die Hard 2.
