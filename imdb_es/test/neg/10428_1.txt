The story of journalist Bob Woodward about the rise and fall of actor John Belushi sometimes becomes a totally wrong movie, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something daring and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his advance in "The Shield") is in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, making a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating the scenes of "Saturday Night Live" that are now part of the history of television. It's like watching someone try to get Lucy Lucille Ball out, it can not be done. The reason why there was so much grief over Belushi's death was because he was unique in his class. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt to look at the paper, and in an early scene tries to escape from the morgue. Even so, it is an uphill undertaking and no actor, regardless of his talent, could have saved it. * since ****
