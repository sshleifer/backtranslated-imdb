I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever made, and it hurts to say that. As a big indie movie fan, gay or not, I had high hopes. Several minutes after the movie, however, the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or another century. His performance and the dialogue he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD on his track. Hours later, when I put together enough courage to press the play button again, it was not better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the sheriff and his racist cartoon assistants, the film has an attractive cast for which I felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the film is good: use the lynching of homosexual men in the "New South" in the same way it was used in black men in the Old South, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With an accomplished writer and director, we could have had a movie. Instead, we got a fake detective job, a crowd of homosexuals and a clich√© with the only white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism still flourishes. The FBI is investigating a white school bus driver in the back woods of Louisana, who forced the black children to reach the back of the bus. But this city is a caricature, and it is hard to believe what you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are some subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for the most part, they also fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For truly masochists, the DVD contains some deleted scenes that will leave it running to cover. <br /> <br /> It's probably the first movie that makes me believe that writers / directors should pass a test and get a license before they can make a movie. Although I expected to see several of the cast members in better films, it would be very difficult for me to see anything else about this director.
