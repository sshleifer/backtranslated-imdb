If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about not so good acting, the "special" cheesy effects and the typical science fiction plot ... this is the movie for you! Not in the acting was bad, in fact, some actors were pretty decent. The special effects were not the best (to say the least); The animals looked completely animated by computer. There was an annoying croak to cover the oath and only one song was heard over and over again throughout the film. In general, a good movie if you are looking for something completely corny and fun to make fun of. It is not a good movie to see if you are looking for something serious.
