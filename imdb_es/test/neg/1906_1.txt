Did you ever see a really bad movie and get mad at that? Even a movie you did not have high expectations for? Well, I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the video title of the United States for "Interference". Now I have seen many bad movies and I have seen many "B" titles, but this is in another league of its own. It was published on the label "The Asylum", and anyone who rents many horror films directly to video knows this label. When you rent one of them, you know what you get. A lot of marginal horror acting on a budget, but usually it's still pretty good. This not. The performance of the three protagonists was more than bad. Even fast forward could not help. The label line on the front of the box says "... in the tradition of DePalma's Body Double, the value of comparing this to that classic movie." The only real comment is "The screams you will hear are real." Yes, You will be the one who screams if you rent this.
