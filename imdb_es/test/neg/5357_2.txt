What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it until the end. I was speechless, because of the incredibly boring story, the annoying situations in which an American is equal to that of fifty or more Iraqis, and the boring dialogue. I think if this movie has something to teach, it probably says "Do not fuck with the United States, or we'll come kick your ass." Also, this movie really encourages and votes to kill masses of foreigners, in the name of war. I got the image of taking the chess pieces off the game board. Except now it's fast and there's not much to think about. And on top of that ... no character has any spirit; So, how can you worry about what happens to any of them? Excluding fans of war movies without taste, I would not recommend this to anyone. There must always be something more interesting to do.
