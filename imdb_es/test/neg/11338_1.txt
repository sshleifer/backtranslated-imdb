When I went to see this movie, it was already a forced choice, since my original intention had been exhausted. What was in that moment was pure terror, this movie is so bad that I could hardly stand it. It is not worth mentioning the story, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old heterosexual team that, upon discovering his sexual orientation, made him have a hard time. Loaded with clichés of unbearably old and overused gays, the thin plot blends perfectly with the inane dialogues ... it's absolutely amazing that actors like Dietmar Bär or Charly Hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense. 1/10
