I just watched this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a brief synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We left the cinema without feeling very sure that we did not like it. <br /> <br /> The performance was good enough and the connection with the characters was good. I thought that the main character acted like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> But the plot felt like it was used in other movies. The script was a bit weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says "Oh, my God" every time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked fine, but (sorry for this spoiler) the main monster in the main climax reminded me a lot of Balrok outside The Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was fine, but I felt that it was over. Go and buy all the media but do not expect too much.
