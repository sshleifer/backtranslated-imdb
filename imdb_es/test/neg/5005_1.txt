Ugh Yes, it's exactly like the McMartin disaster or the horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother continues to aggressively question her child, over and over and over again, until she finally tells him what she obviously wants to hear. Court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The questioning in itself is sexually creepy, an assault implacably repeated in its own way. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers incorporate a doctor who talks about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps to justify the point of view of the film: Four-year-olds never invent "things like this". Well, they will do it if every adult they know asks them to do it. The way this piece supports such discredited interrogation techniques makes seeing it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to obtain successful processing in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest incident towards the end to "prove" their case, there is no parallel to this fictional incident that happened in real life.) I can not say more here without turning this into a spoiler , but you will know it when you see it.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are mistreated, sometimes by paid care providers. But to see a movie that affirms the ridiculous and hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, to see the recreations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children, as well as the lives of the accused. Hard until the end. It is simply too sad, and even more so thanks to the apparent support of the writers' team for the obsessive, paranoid and abusive questioning techniques that began, how can we call it? The bonfire of the sanities? <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone who has been accused of child abuse, thank heavens, but my grandmother, who is a 12-time grandmother, was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. Mobs full of what they believe is holy anger are as dangerous now as they were three hundred years ago. Sensational sensations like this: "These accusations of satanic abuse are emerging across the country, there must be something there!" "So tell the jury that!" - Only the eggs in. <br /> <br /> And who thought it was a good idea to have children under the age of ten, some of them under the age of five, play these roles? It is traumatic to see them deliver their lines; How much more traumatic was it to act these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to combating child abuse apparently does not apply to themselves. And what did the parents think of the children's actors? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the version of A & E Network in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were great. However, professionals or not, were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to pay to represent it. Despite ruthlessly exploiting these real-life children, "Do You Know The Muffin Man" earned an Emmy nomination for the direction, which shows that everything was crazy in 1989.
