At the Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the Lucky Ducks cheerleader team Lucky Ducks must join the team of "hard" cheerleaders and bad girls from The Demons to beat the evil Falcon team that always seems to win at this camp, I guess. Being this a typical clich√© of the sexual comedy of teenagers of the 80s, who do you think will win? But what the film lacks in its originality more than makes up for it. Oh, and the incredibly bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the camp, of course). Simply horrible, forgettable, and unfortunately has a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO comedy <br /> <br /> My rating: F (yes, in fact, I gave it to them)
