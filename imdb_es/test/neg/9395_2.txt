This movie was completely disruptive, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from some good photos of Italy, there is nothing that recommends this movie. As usual, Hollywood extracts the wrong conclusion of a fractured existence: the next you know, with whom you go to bed after you have known it for a few hours, he must be Mr. Right. As for humor, there are some in the movie, but I can not see how anyone could label this as a romantic comedy, since about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! My recomendation? Pass it in the theaters, wait for it to come out on DVD and then skip it there. I want someone to return the two hours I wasted watching this dreck, drift, scum.
