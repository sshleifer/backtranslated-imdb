I never intended to write a review of this movie. In fact, I was just looking for the name of the movie star and then I started reading reviews ... I guess I'll never learn. This movie is horrible! I will not justify my comments with specific reasons because I really have a hard time believing that someone with a taste likes this. A guilty pleasure? It's fine, I suppose. But a film so bad that it wasted so much talent (Caine, Gelbart and Donen) is a reason to regret, not a pleasant distraction. A low point for all involved, except perhaps Bologna, who must sit down at night trying to discover what bomb was THE bomb that destroyed his career.
