This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the only survivor of the accident of an allied reconnaissance plane in Belgium in January 1944, is quite complicated. The title would lead him to think that it is mainly a story about the Belgian armed resistance groups, but that seems to be just a backdrop to sustain a silly love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who leads Ted. Claire's husband Henri is a committed member of the resistance, but it is Claire who decides, in the absence of Henri and against his wishes, to give refuge to Ted. <br /> <br /> The crucial details of the plot do not make sense. A central element of the story is the recovery of the recorder in the fallen plane containing the navigation codes and the positions of the targets. But in the opening scene we see Belgians looting the plane, including members of the resistance. Why did not they retrieve the valuable items at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and watch the plane? And the whole matter of transferring Ted out of the area was through secret instructions and keywords when the transaction could have been a simple exchange. Heavy music tries, but fails, to give some weight to this lukewarm enterprise. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the film is how the love story between Ted and Claire unfolds. At first, Claire is dedicated to helping Ted recover from near death and, when Ted begins to recover, they become physically involved (while Henri is conveniently removed doing resistance business). Julie Ormond does an acceptable job like Claire, but she has a French accent that I often find impossible to understand. Her answers seemed a little weak at times: when she is informed of the death of several members of the city, she reacts as if she had been told that the local grocery store did not have peaches. Like Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be reciting his lines; His acting is so boring that it's shameful. A true American pilot could show such a flat personality, but it is not convincing for the cinema. I did not perceive any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic is the way Ted and Claire act as holiday lovers. Perhaps the sexual release of such heavy situations is understandable, but it seems difficult to realize the seriousness of the situation. At first, Ted is sent to a room in the attic and Claire worries that he has even entered the house. But as things unfold, not only does he enter the house, but he dances with Claire to loud music, enters the next barn to play a baseball game with a local boy and finally goes on a car trip with Claire to a nearby city. <br /> <br /> The young man seems to be more committed to his role, but the script undermines him. He has an uncanny ability to be in crucial events without being noticed. And when he delivers lines like: <br /> <br /> "You've ever seen someone being hanged, it seems like they're dancing, but they can not find the floor." <br /> <br /> You feel that he is the scriptwriter who speaks and not a thirteen-year-old child. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, there are scenes that show that the Nazis are pretty bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Comparing this film with the brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" about the Polish resistance, or the equally stellar "Lacombe, Lucien" about the French resistance, one realizes how truly sad it is .
