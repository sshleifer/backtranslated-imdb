This was not the movie I remember seeing as a child. Sometimes it was boring and I found the relentless annoyance of Beryl Reid extremely annoying. Both performances of Reid and Flora Robson were good in general, but the film was not scary. I think it's worth watching any movie to form your own opinion, but sometimes, well ...
