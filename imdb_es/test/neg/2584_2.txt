This is clearly a French movie. It is a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long shots Long close-ups. One minute or more dedicated to an attempt to light a pipe filled with hashish / opium. A long view of how a group overturns a car and burns it. It is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were illegible. (Why do they do this?) I left after an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this image was not going anywhere, slow. I was not the first to leave. It was the first time I came out of a photo in my long life. (Well, maybe the second one.)
