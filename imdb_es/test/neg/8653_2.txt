I had some expectations of this movie because 1. It was a production of Yash raj 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star cast (??!) Was new. Well, I must tell you that I could not see this movie. Uday, (with his red lips, what were makeup artists thinking ???!) He strives to look good but fails miserably. I'm not even going to start with his performance (if you can call it that). "The Queen of the neckline" Tanisha, with all her screams and screams, makes you want to tear your hair out in frustration. I think Uday was a little more tolerable than her! She seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same proven and ancient formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth seeing in this movie. It makes me wonder why it was done in the first place!
