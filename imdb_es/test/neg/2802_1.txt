I was in Blockbuster and I saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The cover looked good, the plot was not so bad, and the slogan (You pick up what you planted) made the movie look pretty good. But I was stupid that day, because I did something I should never have done. I rented a "Straight To Video Independent Horror Film" Going out with my much better rents, I went home, placed Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it started. I thought I would see the trailer after the movie was finished (BAD IDEA), but I went ahead and saw it anyway. NOW to the review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * In the first place, the performance of the "kids" stinks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) talk, the lighting stinks, and the buildings even look false! Now they go to this house, where the relatives of Sean Connel (I think he is the main character, I do not care) lived there. Suddenly, one by one, everyone begins to be killed by ... (panting) A HIGHER ASSASSIN! AHHH !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget, and the scenes in which the scarecrow is computerized are so false that they are fun. It makes dinosaur noises and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (which is red for God's sake and it looks like it was bought in a dollar from the local family) and it stops for a while and then ... (panting) BLOWS UP !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save yourself some time, I tell you, this movie sucks. If you need to spend an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is an A + fun compared to this disaster. However, it is quite fun. <br /> <br /> General Grade: F If there was something lower under ** F - ** than I would give that to you.
