Well, <br /> <br /> I realize that there is some doubt that Thomas is out there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this masterpiece of celluloid. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that the scene in which George Wendt is taken out of the spaceship BY HIS ** left me shaking. Sometimes I feel very upright in my bed, screaming like an old man at the table of a proctologist thinking about it. If the director is reading this ... he would pay to be an extra in the sequel.
