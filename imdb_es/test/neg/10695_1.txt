This is the worst movie I've seen, so bad that it's amazing. I'm glad I never saw that black partner in any other movie: it's okay, it was not his fault that someone told him those lines, but he could have rejected the role and tried to learn to act in his place. How did someone get the money to put together this movie? Is there a corporation in Hollywood that deals with garbage for male college students without brains? "Oh, yeah, they'll love this one: it does not have a credible plot, some kungfu moves, Chuck Norris, a black buddy with bad cheesy lines, a sweet little Israeli (or is it an Arab, or does anyone care?), And the devil ". Brilliant, and many thanks to all those interested in enriching the human race.
