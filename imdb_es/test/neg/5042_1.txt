The performance was flat (at least none of the actors sounded as if they had just obtained the script that morning) and the quality of the film and the sound made me think about the movie of the week of 70 bombs. The only thing that told me that it was not really a movie of the week of the 70s was the reference to DNA tests. But for me, being Eastern Orthodox, the most atrocious thing about this ... movie ... was the total romanticism of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you would never know about this movie: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known even if I had not seen the actor play the Irish pub, Michael Sullivan in the episodes of "Fairhaven" Star Trek: Voyager. The bishop wore Roman vestments (and for registration, even orthodox bishops wear their clothes unless they are saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). Almost the only non-Roman paraphernalia I saw was the 3-bar cross on the church door, and even then I had to squint to see it. The first critic said that the producers had done their research. Well, if that's true, they ruined the religious aspect of the movie.
