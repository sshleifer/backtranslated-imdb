I have seen "professional" reviews that say that Julia Roberts played herself was "smart and very funny". I do not think so. An actress playing herself? And do it with her usual dizziness every time she tries to comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at its best. Why do not you stay there and say: "Me, me, me, look at me!" The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of anything better than this in what could have been a lovely sequel. And, by the way, Steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to the strange camera angles, then the story has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras, but they had enough talent not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. It seems that you have forgotten a fundamental rule of making films in the name of "style". However, the chemistry of Pitt and Zeta Jones is quite good, perhaps if they had focused more on the film around them and had dispensed with the narcissism in which it might have worked. Once again, Zeta Jones shows how she has more talent and beauty than Roberts could dream. Unfortunately, this film wastes talent and fails in many ways. I want my money back.
