Following the classic 1970 horror film, Carrie, with this offer, it's like Ford following the Mustang with the Edsel. This movie was horrible in every detail. It would have been titled Beverly Hill 90210 and Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both shows far exceed this gut. This movie was just a horror movie. I programmed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of brawl and high school ritual. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's strange friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misinterprets the affections of her love! Wow, the crowd creates Carrie! Wow, athletes have a sexual scoring contest! What this film needed was much more action and much less fatigue from the clich√©s of teenagers. This movie is totally inaccessible.
