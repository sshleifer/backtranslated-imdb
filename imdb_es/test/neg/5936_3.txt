Based on the 2007 spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to locate an al Qaeda brain, while treading a narrow tightrope loyalty to its Jordanian hosts and its American chief manipulator Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the trailers can be forgiven for thinking that the story revolves around the action of the double agent and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman, but the reality The story is much more mundane. Instead, they serve us a warm broth of ridiculous subterfuge when the handsome white boy, American Ferris, moves with virtual impunity through the crowded streets of Amman Jordan, without a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of the attention of the locals. Only during a scene in which Ferris takes her newborn Iranian girlfriend to tea, reality intrudes when the couple is bombarded with looks from Jordanian men. As nothing more than the stuffing. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris is expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the United Kingdom, Ferris flies to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children. and so on. This is the kind of thing you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not in a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In his body that punishes loyalty to his craft, Crowe won an impressive 63 pounds of flaccidity for the role of corpulent Ed Hoffman, joining the small and select club of actors composed by Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as actors who have undergone a massive increase in weight for their roles. It is a pity that everyone else involved did not share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better movie in our hands than this little disaster.
