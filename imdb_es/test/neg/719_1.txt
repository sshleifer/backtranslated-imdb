I have read all the works of Shakespeare, I have seen productions of most of them and I have even acted and directed some of them. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare should be done in the "traditional" way, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There are nudes that are free and unnecessary. There is something grotesque that goes far beyond what I think Shakespeare intended. Part of the dialogue is incomprehensible, and there are elements, such as singing and dancing, that do not add any meaning to the film, but they replace Shakespeare with the director's complacency. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that. I lost the money perfectly to buy the DVD of this movie.
