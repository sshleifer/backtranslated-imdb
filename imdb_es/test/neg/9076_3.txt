Other critics have talked about how frank this film is, especially in terms of male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with their actors often naked and expect something similar to be very disappointing. In addition to a few seconds in the judo team's wardrobe, the shower side by side of the two cables takes a total of 15 seconds. The female lead has comparatively brief frontal moments. Much of the marketing of this film is aimed at the gay male audience, but those who expect even a hint of homoeroticism between the two protagonists (the best friends who have a trio with the girlfriend of one of them) will be very disappointed. There is not even the suggestion that one of the two is interested in the other, or that he barely notices that the other is part of the menage a trois. As a film, Douches Froides is curiously unwrapped; the viewer has very little idea of ​​who these three young people are, how they feel, why they behave as they do. Approximately one hour was removed from the original cut; Maybe that's why the finished movie seems frustratingly underdeveloped. Stick with Grande Ecole, a French film that exceeds its promises.
