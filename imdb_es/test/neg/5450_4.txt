Jonathan Demme is a director so oriented to the characters that, seeing him pull a Brian De Palma (that is, imitate Hitchcock), is almost predictable when he fails to put much suspense in this timid mystery. From a script by David Shaber, from Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme tries to find a chord somewhere between the paranoid dramas of Alan J. Pakula and the Hitchcock thrillers. Roy Scheider plays a retired secret agent who mourns the murder of his wife, who is now busy dodging the bad guys who want to kill him. Take off immediately, but the script is full of flimsy threads and any emotion quickly disappears. There is a visually stunning climax in Niagra Falls, but Demme gets very little from her cast, much less from this one story scroll. ** since ****
