Evil never looked so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine picked up this DVD at a bookstore at half price, I did not know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth laughing, but I did not realize how ridiculous it would be. <br /> <br /> The first time, I missed some of the dialogue (if you could call it that, because we were too busy making fun of the plot of the movie.) It seemed like it was written on film in less than a week, and they did not have the budget to go back and correct some of the minor faults Wait, did I say "minor"? I meant exactly the opposite, for example, the main character is credited as "Ken", but several times throughout the movie he was known as "John". <br /> <br /> If the holes in the plot are not fun enough for you, check out the performance.Nobody seems too concerned about the zombie incursions in your state, including the mother of the main character, missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book. <br /> <br /> The restrictions that the budget puts on the film are just as hilarious.Perhaps they did not have a permit to film wherever they were, by that during the SCENE OF THE GREAT MOTORCYCLE, the characters obey all traffic regulations. The zombies, who had just killed a score of people, actually stop at a stop sign that comes out of the parking lot. I do not even do that, but, again, I'm not a biker zombie. The end of the movie seems that they simply ran out of money. It ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more ... Thinking it over, it ends very soon. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. It is a great involuntary comedy.
