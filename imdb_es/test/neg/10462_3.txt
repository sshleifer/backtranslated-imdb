Construction workers interrupt the Native American cemetery of a large and corpulent skeletal monster that disintegrates its victims with its touch, breath or bone sword! Krantz (Jim Storm), project team leader at the station, instructs his construction team to keep his skeletal findings secret, as this would stop the continued development if the nearby Katona tribe found out about the remains that were being unearthed and disturbed. An old man Bruce Boxleitner, nice as always, stars Sheriff Evans mestizo who tries to keep the peace between the Katonas and the crew of Krantz. The peace was tense, at best, but with that skeletal monster running rampant making its victims disappear without a trace, soon Krantz wants answers about why his crew members are missing. The Head of Katona's Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) warned Evans that an ancient demon, the Bone Eater, has loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war ax (... the ax was removed by a worker who discovered that remains with the hatchet). the weapon got inside) now in the backseat of his daughter Kelly (Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how dad's girl has become a pickup truck for an amazing lady's boyfriend). Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the murder will stop ... and this must happen before the Eclipse or its power will become too strong for anyone to defeat it. <br /> <br /> A solid cast, teetering on shameful shame. . The CGI is not very good, although the monster could have been quite threatening if it is done with a better budget. Ride a horse made of dust chasing his prey, by Petesake! Some appearances include BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan's second Big Jim, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as forensic, and William Katt de HOUSE, as a rural doctor serving the wounds of Evan's officer. None of these cameos lasts more than a minute or so ... sad, really. Adoni Maropis impresses on a paper subscribed as a melancholic Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wishes to use the Bone Eater to expel the white man from the land of his tribe. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty dish of a female Katona whose hatred for the white man against Black Hawk and wishes that Evans follow his Indian blood to end the monster that eats bones. This might be worth sitting on if only to see Boxleitner dressed in war paint and Indian attire. To be honest, I felt for the actor, since Bruce tries to keep a serious face in such a terrible movie. In another clich√© excessively exhausting and exhausting, Bruce Sheriff has a strange relationship with his daughter, who is 17 years old and wants to date the "bad boy" .. although this ends up being a sub-plot subscribed as the majority of the plot concerning the killer skeleton and many of the badly developed characters.
