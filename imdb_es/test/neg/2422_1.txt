This movie is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The performance is so wooden that a door could have done a better job. The plot is laughable and shallow and the real "rugby" shown is far from reality. I still do not understand the "haka" as shown in this poor excuse for entertainment. I am not a Kiwi, but I know that the Haka can only be made by someone of Maori origin and not by a totally American white boy. <br /> <br /> I suppose this was done for the American audience. so superficiality and the "Disney finale" are excusable, but there was almost no attempt to point out the basic rules of the game, aside from the prison side, where the main character suddenly takes over a game of American football and make everyone play rugby. The only good thing about this film were the final credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting sticks into the eyeballs.
