As a film critic for a local gay magazine, they automatically send me an email if they have a homo. Chicken Tikka Masala is beating in the background as I write this. I gave him my full attention for 53 minutes before I found myself screaming involuntarily, like the victim of a Tourrette, "This is the test movie I've never seen." We are reaching the emotional climax in which the son is giving a welcome speech to his father at his wedding. Dad seems to be taking it pretty well. An attempted murder for honor at this point would at least have animated the movie a little. And it made it more fun. <br /> <br /> I did not particularly like Beautiful Thing, for example, but at least I could see why other people did it. It was done with a bit of professionalism and I seem to remember that I had at least a couple of good lines. The lack of wit in this film is quite surprising: even the most mediocre comedy will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest thing to this movie to be funny (at least in its first 53 minutes) was the subtitled commentary delivered to the unattractive female lead "Look at her with her legs spread, it's like the Mersey Tunnel". Completely witty and did not smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who perhaps works in a chip store) enjoying. <br /> <br /> I imagine it is an atrocity financed by the Lottery. If not, I can at least console myself with the fact that supporters will lose a substantial amount of money, since even a low-budget British movie will still push back a couple of million people. Seriously, if I met the most handsome guy in the world and, returning to his place to make love, I found a copy of this in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie"). He in the nuts and will leave immediately. And this of someone who has been about six months without the sweet love mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Oh Lord, I hate this movie.
