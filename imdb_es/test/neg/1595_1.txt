If I could qualify it with a zero, I would do it for someone who likes the shock / exploitation films of the time and Waters in general, I must say that this is useless. <br /> <br /> He does not do anything, he is useless, an idiot with A camera and the impulse to demonstrate his intelligence when rebelling against social standards is all that emerges. <br /> <br /> It is completely amateur, both in principle and in execution, it does not have a point, it is unpleasant. Something disgusting, obscene with the ingenuity of a Neanderthal, is useless. <br /> <br /> Someone said that Waters was probably "laughing" at all the bad press and the disgust others gave with this movie, but why? If I made a short film that described a man in the bathroom taking a sh * t for ten minutes in a row, he would surely receive the same comforts, but why would I feel proud or "laugh"? <br /> <br /> Would it be because I am so unintelligent that I have to resort to this so that I can say "AH! Take that censure and the flow! I am so rebellious that I will do what I want and film it!" No. <br /> <br /> The waters should not be proud of this disaster, the fans of the waters should not see it, it is useless, that is, without any use. <br /> <br /> Do not do it 'They even fit under the criteria of art for art's sake. <br /> <br /> To like or defend this movie is to defend something that was purposefully designed to be anti-cultural to be pushed by the general public, in modern terms. This movie is the hot topic of the movies. <br /> <br /> Useless and obsolete. A film by Poser that demands to be recognized as a rebellion.
