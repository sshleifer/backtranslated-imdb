I love his martial arts style, it's fast, up close and very fast, but it seems that his films are becoming more and more like crime-based lifestyle and less meaning ... I thought he was willing to show a deeper message. At least some of the films had a hidden meaning or agenda, this had some good character redemption qualities, but the rest was far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts are also suffering. I hope to see Segal more devoted in his future films. This film also lacks the story line, there are too many gaps so the thought is lost. Too many things are cryptic without a solution.
