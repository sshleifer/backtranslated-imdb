Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was fun and had the perfect balance of a very comical performance and a serious plot. Be Cool is like a cheap imitation that tries to go through a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was once in the mob. He interprets it as if he were a boring movie executive, rather than a boring movie executive who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in almost all the roles she has played, is tense and confused. Is it supposed to be ditzy or smart? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. Apart from that, just add every movie cliché you can imagine. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster aspiring to Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, an ingenious black imitator in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity. by Stephen Tyler. The only fun part was Rock, which invents its own cliché as the aspiring gay actor of Samoa's bodyguards. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT DOES NOT HAVE SENSE. Get Shorty was smart with Chili playing one group against another and reaching the top. But this movie tries with around a million different characters. And even Chili does not seem to know what's going on. It warns fans of Get Shorty: this is a very different movie, much worse.
