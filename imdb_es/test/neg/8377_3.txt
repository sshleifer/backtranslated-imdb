This movie looked funny on the cover and I honestly thought "how bad can this be?" I did not know. Outside the door, the dialogue was INCREDIBLE. It was designed, unrealistic and not even interesting. The dialogue in UPN syndicated television shows has a more natural sound. The story was unlikely and had almost zero play-off at the end. The ending with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only remotely interesting character is Rose McGowen, who is mute, which prevents her from being ruined by a clich√© of junk garbage (well, at least until the end when even she has to talk). The only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is the naked scene of Rose McGowen. Really horrible Save yourself the problem and rent something more interesting like a Barney video.
