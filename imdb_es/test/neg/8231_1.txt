This movie was so horrible that I can not even describe it. I was surprised that I even sat through this pile of garbage. I could not believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a serial killer who cackles like a chicken. Not only click a couple of times, but shit without stopping throughout the film. He even waves his arms like a chicken that is even more stupid than anything else he has ever seen. I could not believe that this came to light in 1990. I thought it came out in the early 80's or something like that. So the daughter is not very smart either because she was protecting the geek or the chicken man. The end only gets worse and it's the worst ending I've seen. This movie is just chicken ** t. I laughed more than I was scared and I strongly suggest going out and buying a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
