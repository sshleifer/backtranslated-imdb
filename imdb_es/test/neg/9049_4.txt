Eaten Alive is presented as a bad essay for Cannibal Ferox the following year. The characters are universally insipid, the locations are underutilized criminally, no attempt is made to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are ridiculously bad or have been shamelessly stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous scenes of tribal rapes are hardly worthy of a PG 13. Even scenes of animal "cruelty" are more tedious than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves the crazy Jonas, going a bit to the Goldfinger, wielding a soaked dildo in blood; A scene that is simply strange instead of graphic. My dear wife, the one from the 'Collector's Edition of Romeo and Juliet', saw this movie with nothing more than a grimace of disgust. And she calls herself a Cannibal movie! In general, a rather scarce effort that betrays the cannibal tradition in depth. Cannibal Ferox, Luci's follow-up, is a very superior example of the genre.
