I love John's work as a singer, but the film was boring and "not worth it" to see it. <br /> <br /> I thought you did a "good" job acting on your part. When he says, "You're having an affair with the old man," to his co-star, I chuckled at his facial movements ... or at his absence. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not like a video on Saturday night. <br /> <br /> If you love their music, then the video has a little music of theirs, but not much. <br /> <br /> So ... in the best case
