The sequel to Sci-Fi Channel by writer / director Michael Hurst to the classic horror story of Stan Winston, "Revenge went wrong," has its moments and some decent blood, but in the end it falls short compared to the original. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure the filmmakers did not try to make a comedy, but I surprised myself by laughing. A family dispute initiated by a car accident is the basis for this entry to the franchise. The families of Hatfield and McCoy live in a virgin city with dirt roads, drive vans, drink alcohol and kick each time they have the opportunity. Just when they thought it was safe to hate and live happily ever after, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love causing the attack to hit the shan. One night, the two lovers decide to go to the forest for a quality time while Ricky's sister plays on duty, but it happens that some of the Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister that night and catch them. Jodie together. You know what happens next. Ricky finds the body of his sister and decides to visit Haggis to be able to take revenge through the powerful Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! In addition, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential souls against the use of Pumpkinhead to relieve their pain. What really turned the story around was that Harley was supposed to have called Pumpkinhead years before this story was developed, but the stage and the characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled back in time to take the truck to Plymouth. Then there's the Sheriff (Rob Freeman) who has his own ties to the devil and seems to belong to a 70s revenge movie instead of a cable horror movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the gore and special effects were great, but instead of sticking to the way of thinking of the man in the suit, Hurst used some terrible looking 3D shots for certain scenes. A particularly embarrassing shot shows Pumpkinhead jumping out of the tree branches like a badly rendered 3D monkey. The cinematography was exceptional and raised the quality of the film quite a lot. The performance was also quite decent, with the exception of a few poorly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family disputes never end well, especially when families involved in the dispute have to deal with Pumpkinhead. I did not enjoy every minute of this movie, but it was much better than most movies that the science fiction channel spits out. Maybe it's a sign that the Channel is trying to increase the quality of its films to match the quality of its original series. "I would not spend any currency on a rental, but if I had the chance to see a repeat of it in the control tube, I'd say check it in. It's a not so murderous movie, but it rises slightly above the level of trash it does on DVD these days.
