This is a fantastic concept for a movie: a series of meteors collide with a small city and the resulting alien infection is trapped in the camera of a single agent deputy when the city takes control. Let Albert Pyun ruin it! Do not get closer than 100 feet to this movie! Shit, what a bomb ... it could be the worst of Pyun yet! The crazy thing is that there is the germ of a creative idea here, a whole outbreak told from the point of view of a dashcam. When I heard that a while ago, I imagined that the car would crash into things, people would be run over and the infected guys broke the windshield and surrounded the car in chaos. That would be great, right? Instead, we have the initiative driving in circles all the time in a wooded area, and occasionally we find the three infected types that stay there. The last bit is, literally, a 15-minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, only sounds are heard outside the screen. Keep away!!! On a note of relief, I think I'm officially ending my observation of Pyun ... it only took me 20 fucking movies to realize that I have better things to do.
