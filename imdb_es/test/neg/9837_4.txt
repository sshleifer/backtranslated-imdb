This is one of those classic B movies that follow the exploits of 2 hobos. It is made with a lot of cheese and Big Stupid escapes from a line like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals all the scenes in which he finds himself like Jesse (now Jerome). My favorite scene is the mafia of lynchings and the voice of the father raising 10 octaves ("Did you love her?"). Danny, Big Stupid's protégé, is surprisingly stupider, but not as disgusting as our main star. There is also a picturesque scene of a guy who pimp in the restaurant. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive girl and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and alcohol is bad according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. Look at the MST cover of this and the fantastic tribute of Crow's Elam!
