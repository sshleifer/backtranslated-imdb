Robot Holocaust is the most pathetic and pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic film that I've seen. And I thought that the Italians were the masters of the miserable aspirants to Mad Max. Some of those films like Escape 2000 are positively bright compared to this piece of poop. The plot does not make sense ?? even with a narrator configuring each scene. And the boy makes him drag. Scene after scene without anything of interest happening. Special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of sock puppets. Yes, that is correct? socks puppets! The acting is abysmal. Angelika Jager is in the race for the worst performance I've seen. Sure, she's French or German or whatever? but the man is her bad I can not think of anything positive to say about the movie. So I'll stop there because ten sentences in this garbage are about ten. <br /> <br /> However, and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For an episode of the first season, the riffs come fast and furious and reach their mark almost every time. On my MST3K rating scale, I give this episode a 4/5? Search it
