"Jokes" totally unfunny that fall openly, amateur performances (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogues that, in the best of cases, are mediocre. After watching this movie, one must ask how a producer could find a project like this and think: "I MUST make this movie". No wonder I could not get a theatrical release.
