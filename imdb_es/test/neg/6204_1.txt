I just do not know how this stupid movie, garbage, garbage, and good for nothing is a blockbuster. I was so bored with a very, very weak plot (or not) and it was not even that fun. The movie had about 135 minutes of just one paragraph of the story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and is helping the hapless and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) get the girl he wants. I'm not saying I did not like the movie because it was not funny or anything, I'll accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say it's a super success are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are on the screen together, but the first time they were together was in Salaam and Ishq, which It was a failure, so it can not be. But it was a really good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. The name of Salman Khan is Prem and all movies with that name have been a success, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard it's a remake of Hitch, I have not seen it and I'm glad I did not. The music is good, the only good songs are Do you want a partner? You are my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is its use in a really bad movie? That too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who dances with two. Left foot? She is completely crap. She also does not know how to act, language (her voice is always doubled by her), dancing and always stops impressing. I do not like her a bit, she was even disappointing in Koffee with Karan. General Partner is a disposable movie with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. It is better to throw her out of Bollywood and never come back.
