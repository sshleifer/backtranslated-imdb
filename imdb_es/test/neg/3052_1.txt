The worst movie I've seen! 90 minutes of unbearable film making. All the ingredients to make this film a true work of CRAP. Bad acting, bad direction, bad narration, bad composition, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. He also threw a terrible naked shot of a silly blond and that of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were frightening, since these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but this one could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the biggest sins in the narrative: he introduced characters at the end of the film (an old man and an old woman). I would vote below 1 in 10, but the voting system apparently does not work that way. Since the title sequence I knew it would stink and return my DVD, but Best Buy does not reimburse the DVD or consumable products as they call it, or so says my receipt. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and that was really horrible, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (an obvious Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than "Dunwich Horror". This is like "The Howling", how the hell could the sequels leave this anorexic cow? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (even if you do not get any of its sequels) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "The night of the demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second was a maddening and unbearable pain for the audience, because the whole movie was horrible. Do yourself a favor, DO NOT GO! You will be saving some brain cells.
