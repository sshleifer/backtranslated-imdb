It is really terrible. Quaid overestimates more than Shatner. The part where Elvis comes in and says "You can have it all" just kills everything that could have been good in this movie that is bad enough. The use of drugs was completely covered in snow, the only thing that had something to do with his life was how little he had married his cousin. Quaid is also nothing like Lewis and has dark roots and brows. I wish this could be done again in the future with someone who does not try so hard. A larger budget would not hurt and perhaps more about his real life. I was very, very disappointed with Quaid. Do not watch this movie or it will be you too.
