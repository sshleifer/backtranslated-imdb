This is such a complete failure that it makes me angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtlety and structure of Reggio's early films are gone, leaving nothing but a hash of digitized images whose only purpose seems to be Whining About The bad things humans do. How wormhole graphics similar to Star Trek, slow-motion colored seascapes, the multiplicity of obviously fake computer icons, and athletic competition shots show that, by the way, no one has been able to overcome ( or even equal) to Leni Riefenstahl for filming moving bodies, edited along with a superposition of video coloring that a producer of "Dr. Who" of the 1980s would have rejected as "too cheesy", added to a polemic against the "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images as they are assembled and mutated by Reggio and many digital effects artists, and the history of caution that I suppose I wanted to produce. With all the "dramaturgical advisers" involved, no one seems to have taken their head off their own feelings of saying something important and felt that it is possible that not everyone will say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television can make a movie of this type and believe it makes sense; This is the Stan Brakhage kindergarten and, ultimately, gutsy in its relentless evidence. The only irony and tension evident here (unlike "Koyaanisqatsi", where the relentless beauty and strangeness of ordinary images altered by time forced you to consider their meaning) was when the DVD you were watching was jammed and jumped. This is MTV for the public of Noam Chomsky, based on reflection instead of reflection and does not mean anything. Two stars for music, which has the best pomo-Cesar Franck style of Glass and has a passionate cello of Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for your sake that you did not have to record your parts in a reproduction of the movie; things you should not do, not even for a paycheck).
