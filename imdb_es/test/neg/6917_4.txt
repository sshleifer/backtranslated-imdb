Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting, trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is surprised by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and prepares to woo her. But when she does not want anything to do with him, he infects his father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure. <br /> <br /> That is the basic premise for this B- Low budget grade of suspense. I have to say that this movie has disappointed me. Not that it was terrible, it was not, but there was nothing particularly remarkable about it either. It was entertaining enough for a visit, but it's not one that stays in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is a bit corny at times and the acting is simply mediocre. The story is quite predictable and really does not give us anything new. Of course, I can not complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who has no real purpose and a doctor with a look similar to Svengali who fails to captivate his victims. <br /> <br /> It may be worth watching if you like this kind of movie, but do not do it with too many expectations.
