It has been a long time since I was in the theater of art and I went to see Douches Froides because it has received excellent reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> What happens with this movie is that it has no head or tail, but simply a section in time about the life of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I knew it was going to be a long session, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no development of real characters or interconnection between the players. You start in the middle of a situation, suddenly there is a girlfriend and then there is a man with whom you need to be a friend to fulfill your sporting ambitions, but the way you are together is quite strange, since you are "just together", that seems . <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really everything that came to mind during the movie was "when will they have sex again?". And when you think about it, it's really crazy. Because it basically means that there is nothing worth seeing, but there are three teenagers who do it and that, at least for me, makes it a very bad movie, it stays on the sidelines and saves money (my ?? 7.50 is wasted), there are better artistic films than this one. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for the performance, one each.
