Roomies is the story of a man who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. Immediately, his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates to help him pay the rent and get a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these details of the plot is explored in detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. When your uncle dies, there are some breasts on the screen, one of the possible roommates that interview is quite fun for about 40 seconds. The end is literally the worst I've seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life returned! <br /> <br /> I did not think that someone could make a film with so little merit: Surely there are rules against this kind of things that reach the public? The script can not have more than twenty pages, and the budget must have been minuscule because the entire movie has approximately 3 locations and a car. The only conceivable use for Roomies, in my opinion, is if you have someone as a hostage and want to frustrate it beyond human thinking. If so, repeat it and you will have a babbling accident in the day. <br /> <br /> one and a half times every 10
