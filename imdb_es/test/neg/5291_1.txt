If there were justice in the film universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never be allowed to set foot in a movie again. It would seem inconceivable that anyone who has spent two full decades in an editing room, where LS has begun his film career, may be completely devoid of any sense of rhythm or dramatic staging, but this movie is damning evidence. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it's fascinating. From the initial scene, where a nurse is dressed in a suit suitable only for a porn movie or a sketch in a program of Mexican varieties, the viewer is obliged to see how low it can get. The answer is not far away, as in the next scene, we moved to a funeral home, where the next amazing fashion statement comes with a sexy black dress with bare shoulders worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate clothing is not the only flaw in the film. Dialogue is a gift for connoisseurs of bad writing. "You turn my tears into wine", is a sample gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering it with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces each scene of the cheese ball with what is probably the biggest soundtrack ever recorded, which deviates shamelessly from the corny dialogue scenes. groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script presents characters without rhyme or reason and the rhythms of the story are shared as if it were a broken ladle. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is, however, a "horror" movie. Our characters are in a forest where Dr. Chopper hides and his two "frightening" henchwomen, who are supposed to be a kind of franchise, but look exactly like Valley Girls with fake blood rubbed under their Supercut hairs. Honestly, I've seen a more frightening makeup in eight-year-olds on Halloween. <br /> <br /> And once again, we perceive the bad smell of the costume maker's malicious work, as Valley Ghoul One says. Around in a pseudo-Victorian police-mix dress, while his friend wears an anodyne set that could have been almost fashionable in the less modern corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Dr. However, Chopper makes a great fashion statement, he looks like a Crisco cowboy who lost in the forest with his big black Harley, dressed from head to toe in black S & M leather with zipper. <br /> <br /> If this sounds intriguing, by All means check it. There are a lot of cross-eyed and elaborate dialogues (like the beautiful scene of the "elephant graveyard" or the "intellectual" speech in Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be fair, the cinematography is good, considering what was put before the camera, and the actors strive (with tremendously extreme results) to do something from a lot of clich√©s and inanities. You have to wonder if they were really stupid or just blindly desperate, not to leave the stage after seeing the ridiculous-looking villains with their guns from the 99 Cent store.
