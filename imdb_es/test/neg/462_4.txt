The filmmakers apparently had enough money to pay for decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature to move and attack convincingly. We never have the opportunity to see the "monster" move from one place to another; whenever that happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on the "terrified" reactions of nearby humans. And when a man is attacked by him, he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that he does not fall to the ground. This is not the worst scam "Alien" (the two "Xtro" movies are even worse, for example); Actually, it's entertaining enough if you have 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (* 1/2)
