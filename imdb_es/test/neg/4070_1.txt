Fun! I could have sworn that Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I loved all the paintings. Bad movie buff, this is your trophy! I'll see it again. Words can not explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare's career should have slowed down, but I really think he's heading in the direction of Leslie Nielson. It was perfect for this. Terrible, just terrible !! You'll love it!! Get some friends, lots of beer and you'll have the best time of your life. It's an MST3000 party, waiting to happen. Enjoy!! It's worth the rent !! You like the "Colombo guy" cop and the forensic comic relief. The bad guy will have you laughing on the floor. It's also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and it's just as good there. I do not know what the budget was, but they will recover it because this movie is destined to be the best unintentional comedy of the year.
