We were waiting in line to see The Good Girl, an excellent movie starring Jennifer Aniston, when a lady invented this cheap twenty dollar bill that announced MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come and see this movie!" she said. "You'll love it!" <br /> <br /> Then he introduced us to the director of the movie. Now, this should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many movie situations does the director of the film stand out in the lobby begging people to see it? "Is this a Christian movie?" I asked, not really caring one way or the other. I love Jesus. There is no shame in that. "Do not!" she said defensively. What a load of crap. <br /> <br /> This movie is BAD. Very bad. And it is not only because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the terrible dialogue, the alternation between wood and the exaggerated, and the obvious lack of an editor. The movie is too long. If it had been an hour and a half, maybe (just maybe) I would not have had to visit the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, I lie. Look, after an hour of this crap we snuck into SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN, we know it's garbage before going to see the movie. We know that we prepare. And SWIMFAN has hot, half-naked people. The only half-naked in this movie is the desperation of the stars involved whose obvious lack of script offers is not hidden. And the actress who plaid the nun? It's called a personality. Get one <br /> <br /> The people who brazenly asked for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I liked MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREEK WEDDING, I would love it (its emphasis, not mine) MANNA OF HEAVEN. Right. More like: "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah could really outdo any of the clowns in this movie. If that is not an insult, then I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> I've already criticized enough. Go see indie movies, but do not see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM HEAVEN needs a divine intervention.
