I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and I had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive and enlightening little movie. It's a 75-minute movie that feels like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly attractive material. It is not bad in any offensive way, it simply repeats the things that have been said many, many times and in a more interesting and provocative way. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews continue without stopping, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. It is more like a "how to" guide for something that can no longer be done. I was alive during the time but I felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
