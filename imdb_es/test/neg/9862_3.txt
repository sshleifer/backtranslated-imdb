I'm writing this note as a chess player and as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 games of Kasparov-Deep Blue on the Internet. I know something about the issues that were raised. Other chess players will come and want to know if it's worth seeing / buying this movie, and I'm talking to them a lot. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not "in chess". <br /> <br /> This film is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the custom computer "Deep Blue". However, the first image seen in the film is not from Kasparov or the computer, but from "THE TURK". This is an "automaton" that was built in Europe at the end of the 18th-19th century and played the winning chess against all those interested. I put the word "automaton" in quotes because it was, as everyone knows now, a fake. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you do not like watching "THE TURK", then you can not stand the film, because "THE TURK" has as much screen time as Kasparov, maybe more, both in modern images and in white images and black of an old movie. The reappearance of "THE TURK" every few seconds underlines Kasparov's accusation that "Deep Blue" had human assistance, that it was (to some extent) a fake computer, that IBM cheated, that there was "a man inside it" working behind the scenes to help him win. Kasparov not only believes this, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. And then this is not really a movie about chess games or about the programming of chess computers. It is a piece of propaganda about a large corporation that supposedly misuses a great defenseless master. It really looks a lot like a "negative campaign ad", as it is full of ominous music and evocative camera work, creepy sound effects and innuendo ("we never found out what was behind that closed door") and the ever-present "TURK" <br /> <br /> Now, most people in the chess community are quite convinced that IBM did not cheat and that this was Garry's paranoia at work. To begin, for a human to help "Deep Blue" to beat Kasparov, it seems that you need a human that is better than "Deep Blue" and better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspicious from the beginning. Also, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could beat the big masters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take for granted that a computer can do things it could not expect. And it's less likely to be taken as a monumental human tragedy of a computer winning a chess player. (And in fact, the conclusion is that Kasparov defeated himself with two serious errors, including the resignation of game 2 in a tied position). <br /> <br /> As for chess games, you actually see very little of them. There are some comments from teachers and commentators who tell briefly how they were, but in reality you can not see almost any strategy or tactic. Naturally, as a chess player, I take this as a major flaw, but I think that non-players are also being cheated. Imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you can see almost nothing of the game, just a commentator who tells you that "in Game Four, the White Sox defeated the Astros with such and such a score." Nobody would make a movie like that. But here, for example, we are told that Kasparov made a serious mistake in opening the decisive game 6, but we are not shown the position on the screen, nor is it explained to us why it was an error, or what should have been done . instead, or anything. We only see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw this on DVD, let me warn the chess players about the DVD as well.) The jacket promises that the Extras include the games "with analysis." Is this analysis great? teacher, that people like us may find it interesting ... a piece is attacked and a pawn is isolated and you are in "Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line" Blahhhh.) <br /> <br /> Someone could come and say: "Well, clearly this film is destined to dramatize the game for the non-player, so it is unfair to be impatient with him". But, in fact, it does not do a good job to reach the non-player either, since it ignores some points that a true beginner would really like to explain. For example, he says that Kasparov could have received a "perpetual control" in the second game, but he does not explain what that is (or shows how it would look on the board, which would have been interesting). Go back to the Kasparov-Karpov games, but it does not explain why there were two or who organized them, etc. I did not need this information, but I am familiar with it. If you still have no experience in chess, there are places where you will be confused, and this is just a flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can not recommend the film, which, like "THE TURK" in itself, is not what it purports to be (a documentary), but rather a scenic illusion.
