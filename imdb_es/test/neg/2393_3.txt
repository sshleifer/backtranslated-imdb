The romance of the black comedy of Oddball with a great cast and a less than stellar script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character 'Betty', a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful, blond secretary. Guess who is playing this minor role, yes! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") had to wall this project before her superstar status was secured with the hit thriller "The Ring". <br /> <br /> On the male side of the list of actors, there is the unfortunately misguided Alfred Molina ("Frida"), an outdated company who suddenly decides to reveal his "Betty" wishes, which have remained inactive during decades. Maybe Miramax hopes that Molina's turn in the next "Spider-Man 2" can generate some interest in this little trinket that belongs to the DVD rental shelf. <br /> <br /> But the prize for the wildest and most ungrateful performance is for Christopher Walken. ("Catch me if you can"), which is completely surpassed as a "modern" undertaker with his Las Vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. Your character must have parachuted into the town because there are few reasons for it to exist in this script. <br /> <br /> That said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors dedicated to a little humor. So this is for you, and if this is not your cup of tea, then try to rent "Harold and Maude", the definitive funerary film that is still fun to this day.
