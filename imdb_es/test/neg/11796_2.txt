There are a lot of repetitive dialogues in this film about "cold spots" (which indicate the presence of a ghost), and characters who pray to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the sensation of the film, I will repeatedly refer to cold spots throughout this review. I've seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most "forgettable" of all ("it's getting cold!") Basically, some 20-somethings spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. Obviously it is not real, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you could not predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this movie. We have the honored horror clich√© of a cat that jumps out of its hiding place near the beginning, like a fear of "practice" to warm the audience. People wander with lanterns, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they are coming in peace, which does not mean any damage to the spirits (or cold spots) that are inside. Every now and then a door will close and frighten someone. Of course, the ouija board makes an appearance. They chat with a ghost called "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach. More cold spots. Another door closes and a guy turns off when he hears the noise of the door. Fights, brands, he says. Oh my God, says someone. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a good scene in the attic (where a ghost knocks down a chair) that really took me by surprise. But apart from some bad and funny dialogues, the scene of the chair (the fraction of real seconds when it is knocked down, nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. However, there are still some cold spots here. With time, the movie ends. Nobody dies No more necessary details. He was not a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. It may not be debated whether or not it is a real documentary, but if it was intended to be fun. I still do not know. But whatever it was meant to be, it failed.
