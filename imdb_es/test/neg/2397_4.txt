Your time and brain will be much better spent reading or listening to the Charlie Wilson War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, plays the nicest character in the film, Gust, the Greek, and plays him as a eunuch. Gust, in the book, is the hard core and completely free to say what he thinks. In the movie, it is not even shown to be equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown donating blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too insipid and the story is too old for our modern era. We really do not mind the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which happened despite Reagan, not as a result of) by a well-funded group of people who were extremely willing to fight. It is not exactly the lesson we need to hear and see, considering how well the wars are going in Iraq and Afghanistan. (While reading the book, I still had that feeling of deja vu, except it was today).
