This Canadian "movie" is the worst of all! Incredibly amateur. When the bad guys steal a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, in a very low voice: "We're stealing your ship!" She blinks and is totally shy! Very intimidating ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two heroes of Karate are 40 and a half years old, two tall twin brothers! They are really bad actors. In fact, all those involved in this production are not actors. <br /> <br /> There are so many continuity errors in this cheap production that it is incredible. In one scene, the boys are wearing a type of swimsuit. In the next photo, they wear completely different swimsuits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must see for any fan of bad movies. I have it on VHS. It's very strange. I appreciate it.
