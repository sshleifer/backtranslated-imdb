Honestly, I thought that this movie was going to be corny, although I've liked Alvin and the Chipmunks for a long time! I was very wrong. IT WAS GREAT!!! It was the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, it is the movie that everyone should see at these parties! Enchanted (I thought that anyway) was horrible, The Golden Compass was fine, but the ending was pretty bad for the fans of Their Dark Materials, and I Am Legend, well, I have not seen it yet (or National Treasures 2) but looks good. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give anything away, but this movie is great for everyone, especially for kids!
