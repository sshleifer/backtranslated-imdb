"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Yes, some may argue that low-budget films that fight for less can seem worse, but I would say that an indifferent pseudo-intellectual movie that claims to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> Chris Mason Johnson wrote and directed "The New Twenty", and I will never recover the 91 minutes of my life that I wasted in his movie. <br /> <br /> THE SCREEN GUIDE AND CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the script did not provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to succeed or fail . <br /> <br /> In the telling of stories, the three dramatic conflicts are man against man, man against the world and man against himself. <br /> <br /> The script focuses on a group of friends from the university in New York, and is concerned about the dynamics of man against himself, where each of the characters in the film is so absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies before the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters indulges in unexplained misconduct (heroin addiction with no history of why the character is an addict, a girlfriend having sex with the boss / investor of her promised, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sordid character, a man who starts out as a decent man, but is attracted to a foolish investor and becomes, for some unknown reason, a Similar business impersonator - a chubby chubby cyber geek, who does not do anything, but finds dating online, and a gay Asian man who goes out with an HIV positive older man, but has no scenes that state why the relationship works and why what love develops). <br /> <br /> Crucial scenes establish the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self-esteem of the betrothed who could explain why she would sleep with a seedy bag; the background story that would explain why a decent man would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" type character and become an imbecile; a story line for the chubby cybernetic geek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and the HIV positive boyfriend are missing. <br /> <br /> Without establishing the proper details, all the actions of the characters seem forced and created. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORING <br /> <br /> I found that Mr. Johnson's address was without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can be described as mundane at best. Mr. Johnson selected small spaces to shoot and could not capture the greatness of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film, which looked like the filming of a play, and not a movie. <br /> <br /> The score was shamefully absent from most of the movie. I guess Mr. Johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for a total score to improve understanding in each shot. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is a nuisance and the absolute failure in the making of films.
