Heh ... I'm surprised that this movie still exists in any form, let alone that it's available to rent. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the many bad slasher movies that exist only for T & A and cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with a crazy back story centered on moms that reminds of "Psycho", and a bit of the good old ladies in chains. just in case, in other words, the lack of originality wrapped in half-naked women seasoned with a hint of absolute idiocy! Watching while the director tries to make the swampy land of Quebec pass like swampland in the southern United States is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to me is that, in fact, I was at the premiere of this film, because at that time I was friends with Ratchford, the "star" of the film. It was painful to watch Jeremy sink into his seat as the film spread its shattered wings. <br /> <br /> I am happy to see that Ratchford, after this farce of a first movie, has become a hell. of an actor. He can be seen regularly in the Canadian crime drama "Blue Murder", has appeared in "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood film "Unforgiven". We forgive you, Jeremy! It was a difficult start, but you did it right, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T.Paul
