I remember when this show came out. It was originally announced as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, he said "To Be Continued" to the consternation of all the people who had seen all this boring beyond words. It ended as it was supposed, so yes, you can blame the series for having no end. The plan was that there would be another, obviously, if the ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show for too long, and it annoyed people for not finishing when they said they would, so they never did more. Many of the comments blame its cancellation and the lack of completion for the public that sees it, when the truth is that for this show is not the case, it ended in the way it was expected to end, it is just a bad end.
