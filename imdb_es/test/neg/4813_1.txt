It makes "Invasion USA" look like "Apocalypse now." This can only be recommended to the US skinheads. UU., Supporters of John Birch or members of the militia. The message is very simple: shoot everyone: gooks, commies, Latinos, everything that is not American. <br /> <br /> Also, this is badly done, badly written, misinterpreted, incredibly stupid but not fun at all. This film could be used as a torture device by the torturers of the CIA. Ups, I'm sorry, there can be no torturers from the United States because they are GOOD
