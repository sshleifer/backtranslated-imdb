I can not believe I bought this movie on DVD. I do not even remember that he was seen on television last year. Why the hell could not they have made a real continuation of one of the best Christmas movies ever made? Damn and Randy Quaid seem to have been taking the same medications as Jerry Lewis. I did not know about this movie until I bought it tonight and I thought I would see it in IMDb and see how it was rated. Boy, I was wrong. If your reading of this review is warned, stay away from it and simply stick to the first Christmas holidays. Well, at least I did not pay more than 10 dollars for it. Maybe I can change it and get half of that back on Tower Records. Then again maybe not. PS: I still have not seen it, my DVD player got into fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Director's cut without rating), fuck.
