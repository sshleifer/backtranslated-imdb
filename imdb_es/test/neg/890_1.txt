Watching this movie, you just have to ask: What were you thinking? There are so many badly bad parts of this movie, you may feel that it is intentionally poor, as a kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst part of the movie is the address. There are so many misuses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are ridiculously bad. The funniest example of this would be at the beginning, where guests at the party receive their invitations by email: the same camera angle is used for each shot (which lasts 2 seconds per piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktop / The window / program appears, etc. It even seems that the thing shoots in the same set every time. The whole sequence was also completely silent, without music or sound effects. In general, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was being sent to the whole city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. This is not a surprise, most of the songs, including the one that opens the movie, are, in fact, slight alterations of the scores of other movies (see if you can guess which ones). Also, I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds as if it had been written and executed through a low-end midi keyboard. If you are familiar with the LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else about the movie just sucks. The acting is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the movie that is remotely funny, unless you see the whole movie as a big joke, which is playing in a paying audience. Do not rent this. Do not even look at it when it runs in the central comedy. Just forget this, it's terrible.
