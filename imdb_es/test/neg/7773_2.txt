If you like corny movies and you want to see something that you should not pay much attention to, it's worth seeing. The story itself is very unrealistic. The dialogue is not very credible either. It is doubtful that you are related to any of these characters because none of them is very nice. The acting could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. Although it does not say much, this is one of the best performances I've seen in the spelling of tori. She seems to be improving with age. In general, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
