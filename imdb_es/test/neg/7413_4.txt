A plane carrying the daughter of a rich scientist sinks into a thick desert. He gathers a group to look for her and the others, but the rescue team soon suspects that something is harassing them. Then other reasons for the expedition are revealed and that only increases the existing tension. <br /> <br /> The movie is a decent idea and a vision of the popular Sasquatch legend was destined to end up in the movie sooner or later. However, the direction of the film breaks a fundamental rule of horror / suspense direction and is showing up too soon. Of course, the public knows that there is something lurking the characters, just read the title! But show what the trick of the movie should have been that early ruins most of the suspense and, as a direct result, a lot of the fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the extent of nature, but there are many shots of views of monsters that do not add anything to anything. Actually, they eliminate 'Predator' without shame. The low budget horror movie 'Wendigo' did what this movie tries to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the tensions of the characters and an end without clich√©s manage to compensate this increase above the pile of garbage, but it is still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Rated with R for violence and profanity, but it is quite domestic compared to most horrors rated R
