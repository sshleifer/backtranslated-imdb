This film is a clumsy mix of several conventions of ghost stories and suspense, none of them fully realized and all very irritating. The script was superficial. The performance, idem. The fearsome FX was mostly ridiculous, except for an exquisite moment of jumper that scared me though I saw it coming a mile away. Now, explain to somebody why you would need ghosts, black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and Count Crapula CG, psychic investigators, family curses, Irish superstitions, and milk bowls left for supernatural beings. And did I own dolls, all in the same movie? With everything that would be expected more than a good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
