The movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be very different. Count on an acting cast while you can listen to your thoughts and wishes! This is really a rare movie and an experience that I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although in a way it is interesting, is generally quite boring and unattractive. In fact, it's amazing that a film by Norma Shearer and Clark Gable could be THIS boring! The film is based on a work by Eugene O'Neill and it really looks pretty squalid. In fact, it would have been better to keep it as a theatrical production, it just did not translate at all on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this movie is only recommended for cinematics. And those who love Gable's films so much that they only have to watch all their movies!
