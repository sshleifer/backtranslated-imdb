This hokey movie left me moaning after almost any exchange of dialogue or complication of the plot. Patricia Arquette, although it is nice to see, gives a performance below its usual mediocrity. My friends and I have coined the phrase "Beyond Rangoon" to mean something really bad. A low point for Boorman.
