I see that most of the comments so far have been, if not overly positive, at least positive. I can not understand that. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the movie, because this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like horror masterpieces. The acting is unstable at best, and horrible for the most part. The whole movie is almost black, probably so that they can film it in the same place. The monster looks like something from one of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... well, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
