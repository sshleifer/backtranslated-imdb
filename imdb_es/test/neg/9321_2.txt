Let me start by saying that I had been anxiously awaiting the release of this movie for a while. After I finally had the opportunity to see him last night, I'm sorry to say that he was very disappointed. It's hard to imagine a movie that could make the "Exorcist: the beginning" of last fall look good, but "Dominion" does just that. No, wait ... it makes it look like a BIG movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I got too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the disappointment. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same movie within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Also, I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in a genuine way, it gives great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the cast of support in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of a single expression: to stare, and to offer all her lines with the same monotonous tone, while Father Frances of Gabrielle Mann is ridiculous. The effects of this film are, at best, ridiculous, and the sheer brazenness of all this is enough to deprive the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie caused more muffled giggles than anything else, and with the exception of a really chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and moan, she did not offer anything in the scary department either. I could go into more details and possibly give away some spoilers, but, frankly, I'm too tired to think about how bad this movie was to write all the things I would like to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of all this is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give ... a story about a priest who lost his faith and then recovers it after accepting his problematic past ... he had great potential, especially with Skarsgard as the protagonist. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go see this movie only if you're curious about how it differs from Harlin's version, but do not expect to see a good movie or you'll regret losing your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be happy with the first version released and continue.
