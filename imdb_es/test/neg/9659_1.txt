First, this movie is not nearly complete, I guess someone bothered to steal each of the other pages of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains strange travels in time without warning, inconsistent dialogues, misplaced details. In addition, the music is not bad, apart from the badly placed tracks, and also the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks. The cutting room actually did a downhill job, and that says a lot. However, the stray sound effects ruin the tension. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, he just looks worried and, on occasion, expels the hell-bugs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I rate this movie as the worst of 2007, and I've seen some bad ones. Do not spend money on this, it's not so bad, it's a laugh, it's worse. The ratings above 1 star, must present a blacklist in IMDb, because it is a damn lie.
