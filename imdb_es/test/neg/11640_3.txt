Our story: Two divers from the United States Navy search the sea for silver coins hidden under the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our test: extremely boring entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. Jim Brown is completely lost, provided he has helped produce this 70's turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who especially appreciated their contributions! DISTANCE PUMPS !!!
