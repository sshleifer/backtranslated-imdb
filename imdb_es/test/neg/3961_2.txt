The dog can act ... unfortunately, no one else in the cast of this sordid movie for children can do it. A lost but very intelligent dog insinuates itself into the life of two children without a mother, much to the chagrin of his bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children, who may or may not have mental problems, from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. Only then, the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous experience in acting seems to have been the foolish Eb in GREEN ACRES, plays one of the kidnappers. . The same goes for the unfortunate overexploitation of Deborah Walley. Walley's previous triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the unfortunate IT'S A BIKINI WORLD. She also played with both Gidget and Tammy in the past, and here she tries to erase her reputation as a good girl playing badly! <br /> <br /> Stay away from BENJI ... he is a dog and this movie is a dog!
