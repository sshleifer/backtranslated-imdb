A couple of men are shipwrecked on a remote island. Then they are captured by a demented count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the dungeon of the castle lives the unfortunate leprous wife of the count. <br /> <br /> Harrow's dungeon is practically a trick of a movie. Amateur actors spend the night walking around asleep while an annoying score repeatedly plays continuously in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly energetic way; In fact, the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to go on and on. And even though the ending is not so bad, it will be difficult for you to worry about that point. As an example of the gothic horror of the 60s, this is strictly an example of a bargain. Unfortunately I can not recommend this really.
