Although predictable and artificial, it's not a bad movie. It's entertaining, which is all Van Damme expects to do. The omnipresent "twin" device is used again (as in a large number of Van Damme films) but it is not annoying, except for longtime fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth seeing. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme, but exciting. I can recommend it to fans of Van Damme and even to those who are not, but who do not mind an action movie with a good partner. The Russian mafia is a good concept and topic for the day. Clearly, it's not his best movie, but it's by no means his worst movie.
