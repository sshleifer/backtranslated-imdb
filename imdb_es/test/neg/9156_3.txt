This was the first Chan movie made by Monogram. What lowered the values ​​and standards of Fox! I was surprised when I saw my first monogram after watching the great Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired with wild music while Chan walks quietly down the street. Chan is now working for the Secret Service of the United States instead of the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays number 3 of Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, instead of being Chan's last driver in the latest movies.
