When only a few days are left for the premiere of the film, your screenwriter withdraws from the project and demands that his name be removed from the credits, you know that this is not a good omen. <br /> <br /> The books, on which "Wiedzmin" is based, have great potential for a lively fantasy film? "Geralt de Rivia is a sorcerer, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world, but not everything that seems monstrous is bad, and not everything just is good?" But all that did not matter, when a Polish film crew, with a low budget and no, or little appreciation for the work of Sapkowski, decided to make a mini series of 13 parts. The two-hour movie is a byproduct of his actions, to maximize the benefits. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to point out in this case, what makes people label this movie as bad. Argument (incoherent, thanks to cramming it with too many stories), acting (below the average, with the exception of Zebrowski), dialogues (soft), editing (choppy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), add to the The general bad experience of the movie. Only the soundtrack, made by Grzegorz Ciechowski, highlights the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which never took to the screen. Even the great flora and fauna of Poland (where part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe") was filmed, a crucial element in almost ANY fantasy movie, were not used to their full potential. The more I think about this dead loss, the more I am running out of words. At least, it is a comfort to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has directed a single film since then (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, we're left with first-class fantasy stories and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007) that refers to the Wiedzmin books. But I'm sure that one day justice will be done for the Wiedzmin saga, and soon we will be treated with an equally good film adaptation.
