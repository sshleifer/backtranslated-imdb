I loved the celestial creatures and make a point to catch it when it's on. <br /> <br /> So, imagine my delight when I discovered Love and Suicide while browsing NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice, until the top of my tail was. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the last time, I got comfortable and waited. What I thought was a preview of a joke movie project of a high school drugged student (I laughed out loud once or twice, thinking "that lowered the bar to the video") turned out to be the movie . Horrible acting, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually enjoy low budget movies, there is something tangible and real about them because they can not afford to distract themselves from the "meat": acting, direction, plot, history. I would like to compare it with a student who has not studied for an exam because he knows he is going to fail and simply puts his head on the desk and sleeps. <br /> <br /> In the hands of another person, the plot would have serious potential. <br /> <br /> Do not expect magic or even a cult classic like, for example, Divine's Polyester, or Showgirls, at least there you learn to expect a bad performance. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide went from bad, to worse, to the WORST movie I've ever seen.
