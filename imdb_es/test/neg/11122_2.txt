Well, the science fiction channel is still producing these turkeys ... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto become rank fans, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast is in this effort to waste time. The only half decent thing is the creature's rubber suit (which glimpses in flashes so fast you really do not have time to see how fake it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term lightly) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this. Watch a replay of "The Munsters" for sight 372: your time would be spent better (and much more terrifying too)!
