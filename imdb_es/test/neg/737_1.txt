We really do not know where to start when we talk about this movie. But let's start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that whoever wrote / produced / directed this film never read the book. Because they lost the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Only one track. Second, the bathroom scene. Enough talk. Third, the added characters. The incomplete French gothic lady and her black page that enjoys holding hands and spinning around. We also do not understand where this comes from. And then there was the casting. All of them were really unpleasant. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together, because they were so unpleasant that no one would want to see them happy. And music. We believe that the producers of the BBC ran out of money, so they searched their grandmother's penthouse. And they found some old records. Saxophone, female voices and an occasional electric guitar. * shudder * <br /> <br /> In addition, the best story line: "Since you left, the white rose has died of pain." If anyone has any explanation, we would love to hear it. Because it does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what the hell everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly launched this pathetic excuse for a movie for the public. We think it should be considered a federal crime. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is, by far, the worst we've seen to date. And I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: give this movie to whoever you hate. They will see it, and they will want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous publication, we would give this 0 stars, if possible. DO NOT LOOK!! And we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this film participated in its production. Or they were mentally crazy. These are the only reasons we have been able to reach that would encourage us to give a favorable review.
