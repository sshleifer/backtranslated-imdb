My review is divided into questions that really should be asked: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people have been done hundreds of times. It has been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda and Metroid Prime. It has been used in many low-budget films of the 50s, on a par with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And this takes you to another level of cheese with plants that SPEAK. I do not know anyone who's gone, but I know a lot of people who burst into hysterical laughter during part of this movie. I was one of them. Does not the terror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of ridiculous garbage? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily have been copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other film with collage kids with bad luck. However, it is called "characterize" when the film takes hours of its time to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters have had before. Did you never want a movie to have characters that were not just pieces of meat with forgettable legs? <br /> <br /> 3. This was not bloody. A boy cuts his skin. Oh my! (No.) A boy breaks his legs. Oh my! Gasp! (Do not). I showed movies like this to my mother, who hates everything that has to do with horror because she was sick, and she said: "I've seen PG films worse than that." Why was he rated R? " So, why was it rated R? <br /> <br /> 4. This is the only plot that the film / book has: collage children drink, have sex, get naked, bleed, and finally die. This is possibly the most typical example of a cheap and unreflective horror movie, but do people call this "mature"? What . . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I do not think I've ever seen a less original sense than that of A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> Have you ever sat there and wished that the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre, did something? . . well diverse Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just wish that more horror movies would have real horror, not just cheap collage parties put into the movie with some splashes of fake blood thrown. <br /> <br /> 1/10
