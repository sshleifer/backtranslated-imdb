A friend of mine who has a mysterious ability to find and ... horrors! - I like bad movies. I see 'The Pest'. At that moment, ignoring the truly pathetic that was his taste for movies, I decided to try. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The story, although clearly it was torn. Of any sixth grade English textbook regarding the "male hunter" theme, it would be fun under the right conditions: good actors, writer, director, costumes, etc., almost to the end. Clearly, these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> The plague is supposed to be funny, I think. I say "think" because I leave nothing but a slight smile throughout the film. Not a laugh, not a laugh, not a giggle, not a smile. A smile, at best. And that happened so rarely while watching this movie, I even remember the frequency with which he smiled, maybe 3 or 4 times at the best of times. <br /> <br /> So do yourself an immense favor. Never look at this movie. Avoid at all costs.
