*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman: The kind words are hard to find to describe the film I just submitted to. The problems are very wide and painful for me to count them. . . however, I feel I must do it, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish as me. This is NOT a movie for anyone under 50, it's sloooowwwww, sooo slow slowwww, and when the big meeting of Ada and Inman happens. . The biggest and most important scene in the movie, NOTHING happens, is an epic disappointment. Now, as the director should have done, I will keep my words short and end this warning, his film is disjointed, boring, it does not flow and Jude Law is tragically badly distributed, he showed more emotion as a robot in A.I. - Be careful, the movie should be renamed. . . Bored mountain Love ada
