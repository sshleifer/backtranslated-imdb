In fact, I saw this movie in a movie theater. At that time, I was working shifts and I went there during a morning on a hot summer day when I could not sleep. The cinema had air conditioning. <br /> <br /> It was one of the first multi-screen complexes and somehow I got myself in the wrong place. He intended to doze through something else. But as things happened, there would be no dream. Shortly after the wrong movie started, a group of women who cleaned me up and used it as a social club baffled me. I was the only other person there, and it's a measure of the appeal of the movie that I usually expected the place to be empty and they asked me if I cared about their presence. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> In about half an hour, the conversation of the cleaners turned out to be more interesting than the entertainment I had paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie emerged from the screen with very rancid mayonnaise cheese. The guy who has small, dark, hairy locks that grow on the surface. I particularly remember that my senses were assaulted by strident strings of music that sounded with very few warnings, and even less meaning. The cleaners provided a sign of anticipation by putting their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> It was a bird from the city that was going to live on the poles among a load of wooden people, placing them straight but at the same time teaching one or two moral lessons herself. Like you do. A kind of 'voyage of discovery'. There was a judgmental attitude about the entire production. In particular, the lead actress had the irritating habit of looking at each fight with a kind of intense beatific compassion, as if she herself were the patron saint of the spouses. <br /> <br /> And I think at some point she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end, I had been fascinated by one of the silent and halting remnants of sexual impropriety. <br /> <br /> One suspects that there are some for whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think, is a meditation. The best I can say is that I would not like to share your salad. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this movie advertised on television, which surprises me. It is just the kind of test that is examined in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having a job. <br /> <br /> If you ever work shifts, be sure to enter the correct theater. Or the hope of some cleaning women.
