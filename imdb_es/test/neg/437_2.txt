AWiP tries to be funny, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in all aspects. The performance is average at best, but for the most part it is stupid. The special effects are not enough to compensate for the stupid devices of the plot, and the chemistry between * ANY * character is juvenile. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to get angry with yourself, do not pay money to see it.
