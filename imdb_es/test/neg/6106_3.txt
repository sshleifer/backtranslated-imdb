My mother told me not to go to see "Kadosh", but who listens to the mother? <br /> <br /> I felt so disappointed while I looked at him. I thought I should have lost my feminist credentials on the way to the theater, so the next day I consulted with feminists who carried cards. No, they also thought that it was much more an anti-Orthodox legend than a pro-feminist statement, which described the Orthodox as equals to the Taliban. <br /> <br /> While this Israeli film is careful to show that the sect is the sect. The story is about the best ultra-Orthodox Messianists, it's so unpleasant that it's amazing (besides the non-fanatical non-fanatical orthodox rock (!) One of the sisters she's in love with is incredibly sexy. in Israel, that must be a fantasy). <br /> <br /> The theater was quite full, so there is a repressed curiosity to see Israeli films; Pity that this vicious movie is the one that is widely distributed. This was almost enough to return to the insipid Hollywood romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/29/2000)
