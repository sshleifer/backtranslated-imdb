The back of the DVD of this film praises "Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films". This is not so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is badly written, acted rigidly and edited with an intensity without purpose. The scenes are reproduced in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with a good time-lapse photograph. Flashbacks, fade to gray, freeze the frames to indicate the time (which is not important in the story) are made for no apparent reason other than to give the film more cinematic credibility. The camera is whimsical, some beautiful crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that do not matter. The poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh, and the audio is terrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But all this is only technical. The film does not compromise on an emotional level. The dialogue has such a false sound and the actors seem to have read it just a moment before the camera rolled. The story ... things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. The characters are struggling to seize a dimensionality. And the characters have to adopt a position on Christianity and faith in each scene. Make a tail of M. Night, attractive Christian films do not need the characters to say the name of Jesus Christ in each scene so that the film is Christian. Goodness! Please, do not try to show this to your unsaved friends with other expectations other than laughter.
