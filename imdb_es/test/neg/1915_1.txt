I'm not sure why I disliked this movie so much. Maybe he's too old or too masculine or something. Who was the target audience here? If you are and you liked it, then I am happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit of a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unpleasant, the script was simply shameful and part of the performance, although not all, lacked inspiration. Mawkish, tedious and occasionally nauseating - Surely there is something better. <br /> <br /> On a related topic: Why is it that every time I see Chris Klein in a movie I feel like slapping him? Does anyone else get that?
