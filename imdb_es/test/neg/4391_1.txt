This movie really hurts to see it. Not only did I not laugh once, but I ended up with a serious headache. Sometimes, I felt very bad for the actors involved. The best way to summarize it is to note that among sexual comedies, it is probably the least fun and least sexy of all time. I only regret that I can not give you a vote of less than one. Giving him a rating of one is an insult to all the movies that get two or more. <br /> <br /> Now I see that they are filming a sequel. Listening that someone pays these people to make another movie convinces me that in Hollywood there is too much money. INCREASE YOUR TAXES !!! Making a sequel to this film may very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened, or US sanctions applied to filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a really bad movie. Really really.
