As a fan of science fiction and Angelina Jolie, I thought that this film, obviously low budget, would be worth it ... maybe I had some scenes or a story that would compensate all its other faults. Also, it could be interesting to see Angelina as she embarks on her stellar career. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. One thing I learned: at 18, Angelina Jolie could not act. So, to make her feel comfortable, the producers project this whole movie with people who could not act. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can really act) decided to exaggerate. Seeing 10 minutes of this is enough for you to take your eyes off. <br /> <br /> For the horrible acting and overacting, add a meaningless script, an insipid dialogue, a background cinematography of the barrel ... in fact, add the whole bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> The story presents Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate lords as a murderer. She escapes from the corporate headquarters with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid things happen. The end. I would tell you more, but I did not want to waste my life watching this dreck. <br /> <br /> I beg you, this is not worth it. It's not even worth thinking about looking. Save yourself the pain and keep going.
