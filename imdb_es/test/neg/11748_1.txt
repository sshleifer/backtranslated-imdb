First of all, the whole idea of ​​remaking a classic like "Psycho" is absolutely absurd. Here much time and effort was lost. I'm sure they're smart enough to know they can not improve the original. so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock in their minds. However, the idea that started as a well-meaning tribute, translates into a slap for the horror master. to start. The original classic is good by itself, even after 40 years. The Hitch event comes back from the grave and chases the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely, but if I were them, I would sleep with them. An open eye just in case. Dont waste your time.
