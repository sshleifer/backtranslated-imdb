How sad it is when such a wonderful movie as "Jurassic Park" slowly sank into trite and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The new sequel, Jurassic Park III, has not thought about the characters, or a story, or a script, but is based on the action of dinosaurs without stopping, which is not exciting or very interesting to see. The dinosaurs seemed incredibly fake compared to the technology of 1993, after 7 years of progress in CGI, you just get the feeling that the movie was pumped for the summer based only on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Go see "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
