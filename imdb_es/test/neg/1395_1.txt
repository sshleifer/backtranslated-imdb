... and where is my trophy? I seriously expected a banner and a confetti to fall from my roof to see 30 full minutes of that shit. Comedy Central is really losing the ball lately, trying to fill the vacuum left by Chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man posing as retarded men. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that when Mencia is not stuttering because of the blows and laughing at her own scenes, she only makes exaggerated observations that seem to lack a sense of humor. Have you ever noticed that the people on Buick's road are really slow? It's like Dah duh nah! Not even dwarves and half-naked chicks manage to distract themselves from Mencia's lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wetback" as he proclaims constantly and firmly, which makes it a fraud above all else. <br /> <br /> If you can say something good about Mencia, it's your problem. effort. The man clearly has no talent, but like an injured antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows what he is trying.
