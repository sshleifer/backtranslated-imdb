A long time ago I saw this movie and it is still one of the worst I've seen. I like many types of movies; Science fiction, action, drama, thrillers and even horror. It is not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but everyone blew it up. I did not want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on seeing it. I did not know it was crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, they killed everyone on their way (especially the scene with the shot of the liquor was excellent), but at its inflection point, in the tornado bar of tits everything changed. The stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie turned into a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love seducing blood thrillers, do not see them, in the end you will feel very disappointed.
