Excellent example of the disaster that occurs when combining a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical attractiveness. It is rare that I was aware of the performance during the first viewing of a film because I try to continue with the story and save the analysis for the second visualization. In the case of "Full Ride", the performance was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; He was too busy (during the first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for most of the individual cast members, almost everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any real competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are, at least, well-matched physically, finding commonalities apparently too old for the credible age of their characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to represent its characters, It simply exposes the surprising lack of talent of Smith and Monroe. On the positive side, they know enough not to look directly at the camera and do not stutter. <br /> <br /> It is better to have used a less attractive pair that could physically go through the appropriate age. The basic story is not particularly original, it's just another variation of "An Officer and a Gentleman", but it would have provided a good showcase for a couple of talented "teen" actors. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what? I know? I'm just a boy
