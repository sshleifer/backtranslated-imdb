I understand that this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the worst. The whole movie has been expressed since the audio roll was garbage. The voiceovers were so bad and terrible quality. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a bit heavy on the voice over work. The performance was terrible. One thing that I enjoyed about this movie was the quick cameo of Trey Parker making jokes to the aristocrats with a ridiculous wig. There are many types of great directors in this film like James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Once again, I think this was Llyods' attempt to save a shitty movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I will not go on and on, but this movie was a disaster. Check out other Troma titles.
