The horror movie of the haunted house of horrible acting and completely ridiculous that has an out of place, Anna Paquin playing a neurotic teenager who fights against the "things that go bump in the dark" that harass her and her family shortly after moving. to his new home in Spain (?!). Little more than a scam geographically replanted from "The Shining" and, most notably, "The Others", the "Darkness" traced by weak points is basically your typical B-horror feature with some errors. The fears that can be seen by the public a mile away (so to speak)! In retrospect, I suppose I should not have set my personal expectations so high for this movie to be really good, considering the well-known fact that it was archived for almost three years before it was finally released around Christmas last year. in the American theaters. The country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket sales and critics very harsh critics. When will the filmmakers learn that there is more to making movies (whether horror or not) than just the possibility of a little financial gain? (Turkey-zero stars)
