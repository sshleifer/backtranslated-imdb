If you have seen Atlantis 1, then you would know that what made this film really great was a brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was very badly drawn and animated. The story is also silly. I felt so disappointed with this half-hearted excitement that I could not get through the first hour, and MAN tried! The only thing that had this movie was that it expanded the character "mole", making it more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge this garbage from the cover in the video box. The cover is badly drawn in Disney, and it is evident that it takes for easy money from an unsuspecting father. If it were an independent film, it would not be so bad, but traveling on the skirts of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it absolutely inexcusable.
