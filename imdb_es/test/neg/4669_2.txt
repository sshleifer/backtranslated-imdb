Like many people in my general age range, I remember that I went to see this movie as a child in '98 and that I left the theater practically crying. It seemed, at that moment, to be one of the most important and inspiring cinematographic experiences of our generation. At once fascinating, action-packed, fun, heartbreaking and truly inspiring, Armegeddeon really had everything that was happening, even the sticky Aerosmith theme and the tearful tear of an ending. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What were we smoking? Last night I saw it for the first time in years on one of the movie channels and ... I can not even describe it. This is, in truth, one of the worst movies that have been made. Where to start? Leaving aside the large number of scientific errors that RANCIERON ('personnel trackers' in astronauts? Yes, of course, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I would have to say that the worst of all was the remarkable, I dare to say that it is unparalleled. in which he combined the shitty writing with the shitty performance. There are too many examples of this to begin to enumerate here, but one in particular comes to mind: the scene in which Bruce Willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to locate each of the charming members of his story . oil drilling team ("check all the bars in New Orleans", "the dice tables in Las Vegas", "the only black man on a motorcycle in Sturgis" ... all to the rhythm of "Let's go together" ... It reminded me a little of the scene "NEW TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" by Anchorman, except seriously). Ben Affleck demonstrates, once again, that he is by far the most paid actor in Hollywood, that he has less depth, rank and talent in general than anyone else in the business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, OR ANYONE IN THIS PIECE OF GODFORSAKEN POCKET has been much better. <br /> <br /> (I have to say that, however, I really like to see a pre-star of Owen Wilson dies halfway ... is this the only movie in which his character dies? ) <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as THE MOST STEROTEPIC NOT REQUESTED RUSSIAN COSMONAUTA THAT YOU HAVE SCENE. (On the other hand, Peter Stormare seems to have a talent for playing on the upper Eurotypes). It was really quite fun how, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans joined the Russian Space Station (which is actually called that in the film), Ben Affleck accomplishes it on his own, which causes the whole set to explode in a way spectacular in Hollywood. I also love the fact that, in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth that is destroyed, and that no one seems to care. And on top of all that, it literally turns into simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things to rant about, but not ... suffice it to say that this is a really terrible movie. , that I am ashamed that I really liked. <br /> <br /> I give it two stars just for the simulation factor.
