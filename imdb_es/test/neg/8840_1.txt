With great expectations I went to see this movie, the contribution of Spain to Oscar's career this year. Part of being completely useless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, acted on and directed, the film is too long. It fails to deliver the "message" it tries to transmit, it fails in its narration, in its awkward historical configuration and above all in its rhythm. There are some flaws so extreme that I have not seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas, whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all those lizard stupidities). The Spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and quickly losing patience, and some of the comments I heard were whether members of the Spanish Academy had used drugs before choosing the film for the Oscar contest.
