1989 was a year in which Eddie Murphy was not so hot and started making movies that would soon be forgotten. Interestingly, it was also the year in which Murphy directed his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. "Harlem nights" was not exactly what you can call a success, even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together, namely, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Do not blame the actors, as they all interpreted their roles as you expected, even if you have to face (again) the typical laugh of Murphy. The worst of "Harlem nights" are both the stage and its terrible sets. Everything is set in the twenties and everyone has their benefit from the prohibited clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are easily raising $ 10,000 per day, but of course, soon the mafia and corrupt police come around the corner to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can see "Harlem Nights" that's for sure, but if you vomit from the moment you hear Murphy's name, you'd better avoid it, since after this whole movie it's just an excuse to see some good jokes.
