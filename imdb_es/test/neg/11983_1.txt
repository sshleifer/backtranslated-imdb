It is not a good movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects are not so good for an '08 movie. The shooting effects are downright horrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It does not look like Far Cry at all, apart from the names and the basic concepts of the story (the genetically improved super soldiers go crazy). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the scenario is completely different (tropical island in the Pacific in the game, island in North America in the film). <br /> <br /> I loved playing Cry Far. I loved the history and the surroundings. I hated the movie.
