I saw this movie in a Saturday matinee with a friend. The theater was 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny lines, it is more a drama / suspense with humor peppered. Robin Williams gives a decent performance just like Laura Linney. Being a Daily Show fan, Lewis Black is pretty good at this. Christopher Walken gives a good performance too. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly and stays that way for the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part starts and it keeps you a little nervous for the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy? I know that I, like everyone else in the place, struggled a little with this. A character would make a joke during the suspense sequence and you would only hear a laugh or two in the theater. <br /> <br /> To be fair, after the movie ended, there was a bit of applause. Then, definitely, some people enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this film four out of ten, because I think the comedy aspect does not work very well in a thriller / drama and in the actors' performances. , while not bad, they were just decent. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is not what was announced.
