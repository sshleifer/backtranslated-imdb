If Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN had directed the citizens of Blaine in a horror movie with comic notes, the result would have been very similar to THE MILITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this was the longest Movie of an hour and twenty minutes I've seen. To call glacial to the rhythm is to be kind. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project made another film, except Ben Burtt, who made the special effects really admirable (taking into account the budget). Then he went on to make sound for films like MUNICH and several other big budget projects. The narrative is by veteran broadcaster Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you are looking at the initial titles and you see the Milpitas Unified School District as one of the producers you know, we are going to take a long and strange trip. <br /> <br /> The contamination in the dump in Milpitas, California, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Just a few years before, moviegoers had been treated with GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet high and has the ability to destroy the city. Instead, steal the trash cans. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that this monster can hang around a small town and leave footprints eight feet long, but no one can notice it. There is a very well conceived scene in which he goes through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is George, the drunkard of the city. Throughout the film, I waited, I waited, I waited for George to be destroyed on camera, but this did not happen. Fuck In fact, nobody dies. George supposedly sacrifices himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to attract the creature, George smells worse than the garbage and the monster is attracted by the smell). <br /> <br /> The nominal drivers are a group of high school students Priscilla and her bland boyfriend and some "bad" guys who (surprise, surprise) get in shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster is involved in four main sets. He attacks a Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it by an elevated road, but nobody notices. Walk around the carnival, again unnoticed. He breaks a building (good work in miniature) and nobody sees it, except George. Then he attacks high school during a dance and grabs Priscilla and takes her away, as a very tall ape has done several times, most recently last winter. <br /> <br /> There are plot ideas that arise from Nowhere and they fall. Pickets of local citizens in the City Council because they want their garbage cans returned. A secret weapon made to track monsters is transported by a private plane, examined and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So, why did I observe all this? Because these people were having a lot of fun. I had the idea that the firemen were firemen, the entrepreneurs were being filmed in their own offices, Priscilla could well live in that suburban house, and the scenes of people in their courtyards might well have been in their own courtyards. <br /> <br /> They may not be great actors, but they are real people. No one is incredibly handsome. In fact, I would estimate that four out of every five adults on the screen wear glasses. Since this is in the mid-seventies, we see some very bad clothes and some of the men have an incredibly bad facial hair. A dignitary who was interviewed before a meeting in Ciry Hall has such a strong tie and a sports coat that you think he's on his way to play Marcellus in THE MUSIC MAN. <br /> <br /> And that gave the movie two extra stars. Zero for the story. Two points for special effects sometimes decent. And two points for the fact that the people of the community really got together and did it. They can really say that they have acted in a movie; Despite a lot of experience on stage and working behind the scenes on live television, I can not say that, and I'm happy for them. <br /> <br /> Do you remember those great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone would say, "Let's put on a show! Aunt Edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they would do 'shows in the neighborhood' with sets and costumes that would cost up to seven figures if they doubled today. <br /> <br /> That is the spirit that the good people of Milpitas had for this project, and bless them for that.
