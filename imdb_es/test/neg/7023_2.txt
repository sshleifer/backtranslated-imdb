This is a terrible movie, and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. It is ugly, on the one hand, with that modern visual style of the 70s that perhaps seemed a good idea at that time, but now allows you to instantly recognize a film from that period as a product of the 70s. The film retains the story and the songs that made the theatrical version of the musical a success, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But above all, the movie stinks because of the poor performance of Lucille Ball, who would think that she could make something of this character bigger than life if anyone could. She walks through the movie through the movie like a terrified actress who drowns on her opening night, and the movie sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who I bet was very funny in the role of best friend on stage, can not inspire life in this stinking. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
