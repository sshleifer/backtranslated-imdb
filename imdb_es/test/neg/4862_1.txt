Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang have had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as the naive Wall Street, or Sutherland as the cynical surgeon of the Korean War in MASH? Waterston and Lang have also had successful careers in television and film (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So, what the hell was any of these excellent actors doing in a bomb like this? <br /> <br /> The plot of a Consulate Consulate of the Shadow in Washington is not really that bad, maybe not original, but not so bad. Of course it has been done (Seven days in May, a good movie!), But with a little adjustment, it could still have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Shadow Conspiracy is in the execution. At the beginning of the film, Sheen, an extreme political strategist, solves in a ridiculous and implausible way a possible public relations error when blackmailing a congressman. Later, the weapon game with Lang's dumb assassin that destroys half of what is supposed to be Georgetown is explained in the news as "gang wars." Has anyone related to this movie ever lived in Washington? Sheen is about 20 years too young, too young to be that tall in a White House Administration. Sheen's response to avoid a political crisis is so laden with false mechanisms that it appears that she attended David Hasselhoff's acting school. And when was the last time the gang wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted against having a Metro stop to maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another critic that this movie would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. I recorded it on HBO a year ago and then made 3 different presentations to analyze it. <br /> <br /> In summary: do not buy this movie. Do not even rent this movie. If you see it in Blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.
