This movie is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia must have really needed the work to make this film. The plot is not totally credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to a dying son of a detective, but then escapes. He manages to elude the police throughout the hospital, which is not credible, since he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. Take an extremely complicated route to get out of the hospital, exploiting the power generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And to top it off, Andy Garcia (father of the dying child) and a doctor help the criminal get the bone marrow. The plot is such nonsense! Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
