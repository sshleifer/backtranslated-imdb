I went to the cinema to see an advance of this film without knowing anything about it. Recognizing the name of Jennifer Lynch and seeing the 18 certificate, I realized that it could be disturbing. Actually I found the movie a farce. I found myself laughing in disbelief through parts of her. The acting is atrocious: Bill Pullman and his ridiculous trembling face. Although I almost feel sorry for the actors, since the script does not offer any possibility of credible interaction between the characters. After a shocking incident (there are many things that "try" and surprise the viewer in this movie), you see 2 characters sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was exaggerated, or he thought he was smart when it really was obvious! The performance of the little girl character named Stephanie was the best of the movie. Calm and intense I really could not recommend this movie to anyone. He is violent without a point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and simple fool.
