Following the whirlwind of success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "gem" head directly to the video. Each copy was rented for months and I even heard a good buzz around it. So months later I captured it in a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all ... one of the places in the movie (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit regularly as a child because we lived very, very close to the reservation. Great huh? That's where the coldness ends with this failure. I mean the story is decent enough to justify a four and even the direction is not bad, but the performances are just awful, and absolutely ridiculous with a star power really wasted and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke playing a Canadian / Native American hit man?!?! What did they think in the name of the Lord? It does not even look like native blood and its attempt at the generic native accent made it look even more ridiculous. They could have gone anywhere with this story ... they could have hired a native actor or changed the character of Rourke. How about a white man raised by native parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. <br /> <br /> As you may have caught the "stars" of Mickey Rourke in Killshot, I use that term lightly. I've never really liked Rourke, although his Oscar-winning performance was decent enough. This shows and confirms my dislike for him. He seems bored, constantly bored, and his attempt to portray a native is about to insult me, I would think. He is a decent cold-blooded killer, but history never explores that part of him that is totally the reverse of history. Diane Lane, although she is very respected in Hollywood, presents another monotonous performance. She has had her moments, but in general, she usually does not take off in any performance. It seems that it will be great, but when it is not, it is even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I have always felt that Jane deserves a bigger career than he has. I think he has an action star in his blood. All said and done his performance in Killshot is not really bad. It does not take things too far and it is hard and almost heroic in a certain way. He and Lane manage to have a decent chemistry, but he does not get much in his character. I have no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this movie and B) had a character. His character is absolutely useless and it did not make sense that the plot or the story made any performance that would be equally bad. I have rarely seen a character that is supporting so incredibly useless. The only character and redeeming performance in this film is the one given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the crazy mini-killer who wants to join Rourke's hit man. Gordon-Levitt is too crazy and entertaining and his character is really attractive. If this movie had been completely about him, it would have been a great success. Literally keep this from the total shit. It's almost worth seeing his performance in this fool. <br /> <br /> Oscar-nominated director ... who waits? Yes, the Oscar nominated director, John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) takes care of this disaster. Actually, I've never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical acclaim he received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful. Screenwriter Hossein Amini has not done anything that he recognizes, but apparently he's programmed to write Jack Ryan's next film and, after this mess, I can not even imagine why they would want it. I understand that this is based on a novel and I really hope that the novel is a world above this mess. A little action and a kind of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit man, his partner and the mess they get involved in. Unfortunately, unless you're a HUGE Rourke fan or you really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt. There is no reason to submit to this pain. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4/10
