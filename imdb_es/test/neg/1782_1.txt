There are so many bad things to say about this movie and so little is good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes to sink the Titanic, the characters are completely incredible, the monsters are so unrealistic, and I am sick and tired of watching movies involving an ex-husband and ex-wife who They come together in a strange emergency: it happens too often in movies and has become another bad cliche. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that anyone would have invested $ 1 in making this garbage, no matter the $ 100 or more, it must have cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! I did not think the movies could be so bad! Avoid it at all costs: do something that is more fun and enjoyable, like taking out a tooth or an enema!
