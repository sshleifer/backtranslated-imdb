The director / leader Larry Bishop tried, too hard with Hell Ride. The movie wants to be nervous, witty, provocative, extravagant, bite all this, apparently in a style of Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie. But he is not nervous. The references seem forced. The dialogue tries to be ready and fails. Humor is never fun. Good attempt to set a harsh tone, but we would have to worry about the characters or the story to make it succeed at a distance. <br /> <br /> What you have left are the great Harleys and the pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, "bad guys" old and out of shape in what seems like an attempt to do a modernized western by Sergio Leone . If this film can make newer generations interested in the films of the 60s and 70s, congratulations on that. But on its own, it's pretty boring and irrelevant. I think there is a place for style over substance. But this movie is not.
