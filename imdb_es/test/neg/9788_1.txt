Being a former observer of MST3k, even this movie seemed inappropriate to me. The terrible attempts at humor, hell, the terrible attempts to act. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of scrap metal. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or friends of the family. Just click on your other comments and wow, they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a couple of dollars and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent movie pieces I've seen and that's saying something. Watch it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
