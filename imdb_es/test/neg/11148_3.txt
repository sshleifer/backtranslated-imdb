I felt that the movie was rushed, and the performance was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid, and the guy who played the devil was horrible. The story was confused and idiotic. The movie did not make sense, and it was incredible. The movie is not the worst movie, but it's not very far from it. Overall, I was very disappointed, it could have been much better. My score is 3 out of 10
