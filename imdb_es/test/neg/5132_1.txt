My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 in a blockbuster. If I had known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be, I would not have paid a dime. I did not have any warning for this bs. The acting can not even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is uncomfortable, and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing so, and the male villain ... God, he could not say he was going to attack Emily And the musical signals ... my lord. This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent this. In fact, if you look at it, measure your eyeballs. This movie is not from God, it's from hell. I'm going to take the last two lines to write blah blah shiz because I really do not want to continue with this revision.
