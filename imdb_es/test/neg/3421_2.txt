This film illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that is holding it back. <br /> <br /> Incredible talent, outstanding performances (especially by Victoria Hill), but a disappointment in virtually every other aspect. <br /> <br /> An "adaptation" of some kind, did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, establishing it in present-day Australia is not enough) and, essentially, it did not manage to justify its existence, apart from (let's Accept it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there is a body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it is Shakespeare's. So, any adaptation, if it is not a self-indulgent and meaningless exercise, needs at least to bring a new interpretation to work. <br /> <br /> And that's what Macbeth can not do. As it was done, this movie has no contemporary relevance at all. It's the same piece we've seen countless times (too many!) Before. Except with guns and different outfits. <br /> <br /> Aside from the fundamental error (there is no other way to say it) of maintaining the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the most criminal moments of the film is the prolonged and incredibly slow and boring camera shoots towards the final, during which I disconnected completely, although I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there it goes. <br /> <br /> I suppose the movie is successful on its own, in very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its filmmakers must stop being proud of being successful in limited terms and, in fact, setting standards high enough to show that they respect the kind of acting talent with which they work. . <Br /> <br /> A shame. An absolute shame.
