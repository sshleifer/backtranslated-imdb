I do not know if I should be entertained or insulted by fool like this published by "Lifetime: Television For Women" It should be renamed "Lifetime: Television for Shut In Drama Queens" because I have not seen a movie yet It's not a tear shaking the boiler pot. This movie was no exception. You know that a movie is going to be bad when the main protagonist is Tori Spelling, completely a creation of a bad plastic surgery and a spoiled privilege without any real talent. All the others matched her in an incredibly bad performance and the plot was more than silly, as if someone could believe something of that. If you had not been helpless on the sofa nailed looking with the same fascination that you see a bloody car accident, would have changed the channel.
