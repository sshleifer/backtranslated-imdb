Horrible Horrible movie, I still can not believe that my friend convinced me to see this. No plot, bad acting, scenes without grace, and a very very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst I've seen and it's worse than Halloween III, which also gave it 0 stars. So I give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well, here a 1, but you understand the point.
