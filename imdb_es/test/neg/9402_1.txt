Please do not go see this. I had several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the development of the character was. Pacino played again with Pacino and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem to be composed of 20 other bad films by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I wondered why I did not leave this in 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would suggest never watching a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was horrible.
