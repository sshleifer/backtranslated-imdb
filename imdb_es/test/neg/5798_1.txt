I can laugh at almost anything, but unfortunately there is not one in this stink bomb. Honestly, I saw this movie from beginning to end, and I did not even make a smile. I'm surprised that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc., put their names on this piece of shit. The worst that never came out of the worst that came out of the former SNL players. What more can I say? How could that nonsense, without grace and without grace, come from a group of apparent talents !! Maybe I have lost my sense of humor (not likely), but I can not remember a movie that has displeased me so much in a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never go back.
