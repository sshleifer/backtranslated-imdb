I expected this movie to be absolutely horrible. Like "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show" or something like that. Well, they were selling it for Â£ 3.99 at my local HMV and I had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover, you know you can not help but love him, and then my friends challenged me to buy it. And I was sure it was going to be garbage. Maybe that's the only reason I could sit in this movie, because my standards were never that high.
