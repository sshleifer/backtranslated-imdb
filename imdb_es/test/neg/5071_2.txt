I would love to write a short summary of the plot of this film, but ... there is simply not one! If you just look at the keywords of the plot of this title, you already know the full content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes of pure sordid and nothing more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternative title that does not even appear on this list) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic of the woman in prison, but totally lacks the brutality of one. WIP movies are meant to combine graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has only been replaced by more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich surely can not compete with specialists in the field, such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and should have concentrated on making ordinary soft-core films. The only aspects that resemble a bit of cult cinema are the similarity of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a girl (minor?) By soldiers. The girls are dazzling, however, and the shooting location of Ibiza looks very charming.
