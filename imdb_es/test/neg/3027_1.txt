Without a doubt, Begenten is someone's attempt at originality, but what we have here is art in its most morbid and grotesque form, so, for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it does not matter what is abomination. it's about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> At the last incoherent horror, we start at an unknown moment, in an unknown place. From the beginning, we immerse ourselves in the psychotic nightmare that is Begotten, a god is, apparently depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, I mean, really trying to end it all, it takes a while (why not?) After from this ultra-morbid introduction, something is happening, something is coming out of the corpse, say hello to Mother Earth? What she does? Well, she gives birth to one thing. The thing probably would have preferred to stay in the womb, but that's life. The realm of Begotten's psychotic nightmare welcomes the thing in the only way it knows how. The thing, together with Mother Earth, is mutilated by strangers, hooded, assailants, with bad intentions as the only available clarity. From this point, things crawl as never before had crawled. Interesting, somber images, with a totally decent soundtrack, are the highest points of the rest. Not to give the impression that I do not recommend this evil, because I do it, but only once, and only for people who appreciate the dark side. <br /> <br /> From my description, it may seem that I do not "understand" Begotten Trust me, I understand it, and yes, Begotten is art if I have ever seen it. Everything in this film, regardless of how unrelated it may seem, is significant. That, perhaps, is the only thing that makes Begotten art. That said, most of us require some kind of entertainment value, and this comes from someone who enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the first five intriguing minutes, I've seen them in a movie, but let's face it, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it is intended for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case , no matter. But how would you rate such a boring masterpiece? Depending on how long your attention may take, it should be 1 or 10, any other number simply would not make a statement. It hurts to do this, but as for the value of entertainment, Begotten is not. 1/1
