I'm an employee of a video store, so I try to watch the movies we're about to release each week. I do not have a problem with this; In fact, I feel it is a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero whimpering and grunting after scene, I really wondered if they planned to get to the point. I felt that I should be paid to see this at home, in my spare time. And if he had known there was another hour to endure, he could have resigned at that moment. I did not care about the characters, the footage did not have anything special, and Ford made kissing seem like a chore. Even the score was incongruous and discordant. What a waste.
