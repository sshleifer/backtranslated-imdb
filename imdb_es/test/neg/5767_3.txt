Let me start by saying "I LOVE horror movies" Big budget, low budget, renowned actors, not name actors, it does not matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. However, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The actors show little or no emotion when they present their lines and the acting is worse than many low budget horror films that I have seen. As the actors are killed, you might care less. There is very little blood (I have no idea what movie other critics saw when they say that there is good blood in it, because there is not) and the special effects are, at best, deficient. They steal a lot of so many better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday the 13th, Leprachaun) and it still does not help. <br /> <br /> Luckily I saw it on Showtime and I did not really have to pay extra money to watch it or lose a spot in my Netflix queue. There are so many better horror movies and I recommend that you watch them instead of this big disappointment.
