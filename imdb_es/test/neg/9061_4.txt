I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70s and early 80s and John Candy was one of the main reasons for that. They gave him funny characters from the wall and it was just hilarious. Unfortunately, he could not get these roles in the movies. Again and again I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which I almost played the "direct" role instead of the funny guy. "Armed and dangerous" rarely tries to use the comic abilities of John, or Harold Ramis, for that matter. It's just a very predictable type of police and thief movie. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, the movie can be seen, but do not expect to laugh a lot.
