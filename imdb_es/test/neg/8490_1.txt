Is there any reason to revive the characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was because the actors played them? <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron DÃ­az, or better yet? , who can replace them at reduced prices, since most of the studios know that the sequels do not generate the same amount of income as the original ones, so they cut corners from the first moment. <br /> <br /> Where are the good movies? Good movies will be played if the powerful Hollywood studios can clog the 3,000 theaters that open the weekend with any fanatic in whom they feel that the general public can be cheated. <br /> <br /> Enough people, this sequel has to stop and Hollywood people need to start acting together or start distributing a much better foreign product that is floating in limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake up to Hollywood, because people have woken up and are not buying it just because it's new and bright. Give us the good and send us the rest to the DVD shelves, because we are recovering the cinemas once and for all!
