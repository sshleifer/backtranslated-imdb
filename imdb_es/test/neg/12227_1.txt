We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition, which was our intention, and 'The Comebacks' was the only movie that had not yet started. I had an idea of ​​how bad a movie was after reading the brief review at the ticket counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the movie started. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriters and the director threw every imaginable sports cliché to the public without creating a single laugh, not even one during the entire film. . Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars that schools and fans spend every year in football and you realize how mature it is to be parodied or lampooned. If you add Texas to the mix, you should create the sporty version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not a big yawn. <br /> <br /> The first movie that came to mind when we left the theater was "I can not stop the music" In comparison, this was "I can not stop the music" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or Village People. <br /> <br /> If the movie had a single note of grace, I was watching Matthew Lawrence grow up.
