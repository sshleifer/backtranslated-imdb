I can not hit this movie too terribly, because it's obvious in the middle of the remark that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make are actually fun, but often simply because of the cheese factor. Watch the game of the 'space invaders', really played like in real life! Scratch your head in the clumsy robots ... oh, the madness! And see all the way to the top near the end with the 'Time Warp'! And the sexual advances are still flying ... I'm really surprised that he got away with a PG. Oh good. A fun way to lose a couple of hours, but Star Wars / Trek this is not so, folks. 3 out of 10
