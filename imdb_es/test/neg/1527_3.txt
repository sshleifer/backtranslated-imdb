The topics presented are very interesting; Suburban culture, suburban expansion, public transportation, oil and gas depletion, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this is a piece of pure and blatant propaganda. A point of view is presented, then the viewer is struck again and again. You see that the same handful of "experts" are repeatedly defending their case. The supposed 'narrator' begins to sound like a news reporter, but in the end, even he is preaching the dogma of the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the film is not so much the grim and abominable message about oil. Exhaustion, but the feeling that the people in the film are really looking forward to a post-oil society and everything that goes with it. They paint this image of a utopian society where we all return to the autonomous local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow your own food and, in general, live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society would seem like a great vision of a better world. Without a doubt, it would mean the end of globalization and, better yet, the end of Walmart. I will give you some credit for applying real mathematics by exposing the weaknesses of several oversized alternative energy sources, such as ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 stars because I appreciated the old images and the premise.
