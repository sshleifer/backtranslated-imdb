The acting was horrible. Special effects, although exceptional, dominated the film. The writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was incredible. And the little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst offense of "Armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, that's 800 miles wide! Does not anyone at NASA see the asteroid until a midday meteor shower rages in New York? Suuuuure Does NASA hire a rig to join the astronauts and train them in a week? Yeah sure. Does anyone bring a weapon on the space shuttle? Yes, that is realistic. And Bruce Willis explodes the asteroid with three seconds to spare. How Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I took out the asteroid!
