I was not really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend was still bothering me and bothering me to watch this movie, especially because she is so in love with Channing Tatum, I tease her constantly saying that is the only reason why I loved it the movie. But somehow it convinced me that it was a movie that was worth seeing, that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance, that I would love Step Up, eh, what the hell? I suppose that, in some way, all the movies have the right to a visualization. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know those movies that I just mentioned above? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love and that's what you have. Not to mention that you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you've seen Step Up. Because Channing is low class, with the intelligence of the street, he naturally feels the music, while the class girl must follow step by step How will they fall in love if they are so different? After all, this is your chance to "move on" to the passion, mystery and lust of the dance! <br /> <br /> Well, that was a silly explanation of the plot, but as I said, whenever you've seen the movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. I do not understand how he has a rating of 5.5, I bet those Channing lovers are! Haha I am joking with you, but everything is fine, I think I did not understand what others did with passion, the mystery that is dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you? <br /> <br /> 4/10
