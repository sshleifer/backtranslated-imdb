The sister of a frat boy who lives at a party is brutally murdered by a street gang, which leads the young man to a sudden psychotic attack. He and his friends kill half of the city to bring his sister back to life. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS premiered one year after this movie and was more entertaining. Linnea Quigley, who has a leading role in this film as the sexy (and briefly nude) girlfriend of one of the boys, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This movie is unsatisfying, although it offers enough escapist entertainment and free nudity to please its audience (me). <br /> <br /> MPAA: R rating for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
