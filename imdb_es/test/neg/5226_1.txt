Wow, this is a big anti-Christian prejudice! This is based on a Stephen King novel and he wrote this kind of bias before and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film, we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest BOTH act like fools and, at the same time, are profane. Of course, the devil has taken over the city, so perhaps his influence is also on these guys, but they are typical of Hollywood. They never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham, or his minister or local priest. And - another "given" - make Satan's character the most interesting in the movie. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the Devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow has played several of these roles after portraying Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Do you wonder why the actors are so screwed? They do not know if they are God, Satan or someone in the middle. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who played many unpleasant roles until recent years, is properly included in this story. He and the rest of the petty characters in this movie DO NOT make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From what I've heard, King's book is even darker and sicker than this movie full of hate But better built. Frankly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
