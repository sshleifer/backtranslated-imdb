Badly acted, poorly written and misdirected. The special effects are cheap. The best performance is Yvette Napir, but that does not say much. The story is a confusing mess about corporate greed that leads to the sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those who are stranded on board. <br /> <br /> There is little suspense and even less action. There is a chase of a car that is not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of time for everyone.
