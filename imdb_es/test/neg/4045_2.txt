If you want to see how to ruin a movie, study this very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people should buy it just for that reason. Consider especially how most scenes look like they stopped in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film at all levels. The general impression is that someone was given a script below the average, aspiring actors, an average director and absolutely no budget. With a formula like that, I just had to be condemned. <br /> <br /> I rented it once, and I swear I was stupid looking at it. If you're a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie, and burn it-DISCOVER it-as a favor to the world. He does not have a discernible plot, bad acting, and then he throws something about ugly and evil women to really get it over with. I would suggest seeing the paint dry before this stupid rubbish of a tape! Seriously. The painting would be better. I wish I could give this negative 10 stars.
