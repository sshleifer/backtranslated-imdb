Okay, I agree with everyone who hates Barney on this site. I think Barney and his friends are ugly and unpleasant, and the program is very skewed and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But what bothered me the most is how Barney introduced Gays, lesbians and bisexuals in his show when talking about parents and family members of the same sex. That would not be a big problem if the creators of this program did not use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all gay men wear mascara and love the purple and pink colors, and not all lesbians are ugly and manly with a chest that sinks to the abdomen. As a bisexual woman, I think this is terrible for a children's show. If this were South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who see Barney are small children or disabled children who usually can not distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now that I think about it, Barney seems to be an ugly gay stereotype. . Let's see, he has no girlfriend, he's pink and he wears sequined clothes (yes, that's right). If you claim to be for the rights of homosexuals and bisexuals, then stop mocking them in front of people who do not know any better. If Barney died of face and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the program would be removed from the air before you know it. <br /> <br /> I give this program one negative out of five. Do not show your children such hateful shit. There are shows for children out there that are less insulting.
