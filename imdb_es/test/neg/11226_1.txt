I guess today they reward idiocy because whoever came up with the concept of this movie was not filmed in plain sight. <br /> <br /> This is a delight for the crazy people. The worst types of stereo in every ghetto and high school movie creep in and become even more unbearable. Each character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. Pray for a new version in which the whole school is affected. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** How is it that such a run-down school has internet in the first place?
