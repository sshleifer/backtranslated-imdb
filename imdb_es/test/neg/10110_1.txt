This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen! The cast is international: Australian who pretends to be British, American of scene and a character with an English name that has an "European" accent unrecognizable. The acceptable efforts in the performance of this motley team are totally undermined by a plot and a script of special inanity. So short were the racks of the budget of this movie and the production values ​​in general are so low that I would have no problem winning a limbo film competition. In the last twenty years, more or less, we have seen horror films and suspense films of steels of extraordinary quality (although not necessarily "high") that have been made without any budget. Recent examples include the badly done but totally scary "Blair Witch Project" and, of course, the most recent, the low budget winner, SAW, with virtually unknown clues (Gary Elwes is just someone you do not remember, even if you've seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS, it is shocking to find a well-known character actor, Dominique Pinon, and Hollywood has been Jeff Fahey fighting bravely to save the film. It's embarrassing to see the once-handsome man (Fahey) with extravagant makeup uttering strangely bad phrases. I would have rated this movie with 0 out of 10 if it had been possible!
