Just adding to the chorus of people who considered this to be "irredeemable", I will declare the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS clearly stated by some of the other commentators: The "movie" was filmed on video (what type of camera do I not use? I do not know, but the cameraman had it in AUTOFOCUS (!) All the time, so that any slight movement causes it to go in and out of focus.In many of the scenes, the actors themselves get out of focus for their scenes. shouts "Amateur." <br /> <br /> I also noticed that in the 'middle of the corn field', you can hear the sound of the gas generator that is turning on the lights ... loudly. <Br> <br /> There is also what there is with that single source of illumination that follows (and often "guides" the actors) when they walk around, it seems like a news anchor with that "camera light" that follows the people as a There was no 'credit' for the lighting design / DP and I know The 'filmmakers' did not see the need to have someone who really knew what they were doing by lighting up this image (note that I did not say "movie"). So get ready for a single dazzling spotlight as the only source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. UGhhh! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically inept production I've seen commercially launched. "I bought" this title because I like bad movies. It's usually so bad that you can laugh about it. This is so bad that you can not see it. Plan Nine from Outer Space is "Citizen Kane" compared to this title.
