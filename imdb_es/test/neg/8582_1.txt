I have always found that the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts are deeply pretentious, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographies (which he invented by accident and which are simply direct contact photographs), his only real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to represent female nudity in a way that was accepted as art and not as art. . That as porn But surely this had to happen over time, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... presents many blurry photographs and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfish have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs, and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies, but if that has anything to do with the subject of this film, Ray does not say so. I was much more impressed by the title cards of this film, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a play on words ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> As very often in Ray's work, in fact, there is a beautiful young girl seen in this movie. Unfortunately, photography is (to a large extent) so blurred that we have few opportunities to appreciate it. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.
