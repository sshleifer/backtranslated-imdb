I saw this movie at midnight and I can say it's worse than another horror movie about Haunted House. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses, but she can do the paper better. The girl gets worse. This is an example of bad actress, has no future in the great world of cinema. JUDGMENT FOR THE HOUSE OF THE MALDOS: BAD
