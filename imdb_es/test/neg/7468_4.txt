I saw Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was getting into and if I had any ideas I would not have entered. This is the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time. It tries to be provocative, but deep, with its homosexual full frontal sex scenes, it's not successful! It's just another bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4/10
