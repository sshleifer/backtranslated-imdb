This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while you see this nonsense about a nice girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets involved with the 'underworld' because she needs money (and because she too lazy to take a job of friends after they offer it to her). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he is nowhere to be found for the first half hour and, when he appears, he remains like a constipated mannequin. A real failure with enough scenes with talent and unpleasant characters (as well as stupid) so you want someone to shoot someone, as really fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
