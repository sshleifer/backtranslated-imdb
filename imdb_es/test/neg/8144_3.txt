For an indy movie, this is probably a little better than 3 out of 10, but generally it only gets 3. The effects are not horrible and at least some adults play adult roles instead of all the children as many. low budget indy horror movies do it. The performance is very wooden, but at least they had a better "exhibition" than some films in the category of smaller budget. It was filmed a lot inside a building instead of a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It's a Resident Evil scam about an evil corporation that invades a small city and an outbreak turns people into zombies. I would have liked to have seen some kind of creatures instead of the big evil one, just being another "super" zombie. I try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be careful! SPOILER ALERT !!! Not only some of the cast members seem to shrug their shoulders beyond the zombies (they are recycled again and again, but at least they have more than 5 people who interpret them). But one of the twists of the plot does not really fly with me. The deputy who enters is on the payroll of the evil corporations. Kill one of the other employees in cold blood and then meet the head of the office in an office talking about the cleanup of the disaster. The deputy has just shown us that he is also a really bad person and talks as if he could clean it up (that is, kill all the surviving witnesses) without any problem. But then 2 seconds later, he is helping them. There was no real emotion of "change of heart" or anything that made me feel that this bad guy killed an innocent man a few minutes ago and then talked about getting everyone out of trouble to be his savior. There was no incident or anything that made me participate in this. It is worth seeing if you are a fan of low budget movies, otherwise you will not enjoy this.
