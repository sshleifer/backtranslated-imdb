I remember seeing this years ago, it had a reasonably promising start, with an interesting premise, but then quickly degenerated into nonsense. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and also a bit of simplistic philosophy, culminating in a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> Simply, it's garbage. <br /> <br /> Before watching this TV movie, I did not think I would ever have a movie that I thought was the "worst" I had seen, but after I finished watching this, I knew that since then Go ahead, if someone asks me what is the worst movie I've seen in my life, I can say without hesitation: "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
