This is an example of a textbook of how Hollywood does not (do not) trust spectators and prides itself on its big stars. Christian's character has been completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah faces from his own army unit is practically eliminated, Michael's story has changed significantly and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book. I almost wish I had not seen it, due to the ability of the movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; I would have liked to stay with the printing of the book. The book could have been written today, it is so honest and courageous. The movie, either. My advice: skip the movie; Read the book.
