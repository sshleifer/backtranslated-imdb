<br /> <br /> It will not be long in this movie. The first half hour was one of the most boring I've had to face since I started watching movies. The story did not advance, nothing was explained about any of the characters. It felt like a non-movie. (Many people had already left the audience at this time). <br /> <br /> Much of the scene was totally unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director should have studied cinema a bit more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make the story move forward. He never did. <br /> <br /> The supposedly funny moments were devised, and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I suppose). <br /> <br /> Prize of the Jury at Cannes 2002 ... I do not know what the jury was thinking ... probably the "right political effect". <br /> <br /> I would have loved to love him, the disappointment was therefore, even bigger. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
