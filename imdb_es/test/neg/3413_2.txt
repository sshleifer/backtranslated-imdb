I just saw this movie in a lovely air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And since the outside temperature is hovering somewhere around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt was not wasted. <br /> <br /> Failing that, I have not seen a piece of junk extremely well done in a long time. This is the kind of movie that provides a taste test, so to speak. Anyone who says he likes or loves him, immediately enters the same list of crazy people who still talk about the superiority of British television. At least the width of Gormless in the wheelchair was good for some laughter. <br /> <br /> The pseudo-depth and thick lips, although characteristic of much of French cinema, do not really make a good movie. I prefer to see Independence Day 10 times in a row than to sit through this stench once more.
