Clint Howard, Ron's most talented brother, stars in this horribly terrible horror comedy about a mental case that serves ice cream to children and kills people. Struggling to be a movie that is of the variety 'so bad that it's good', this movie loses that mark for a good mile and, instead, has to be seen as' so bad that it's ... well ... BAD ' If it is the constant cinema of "shoes of shoes", the pillow stuffed with "fat boy" or the "horror" that induces to sleep what soured me of the movie, I do not know, all I know is that I hated the movie ( and this about a guy who has a weakness for B-horror movies). Paul Norman chooses to continue making films in the porn industry before and after this, his only "conventional" movie. A wise choice, in fact, as a horrible act, a meaningless argument and a ridiculous dialogue are much more pleasing to see a porn star doing their thing. Interestingly, this turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to get away) <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
