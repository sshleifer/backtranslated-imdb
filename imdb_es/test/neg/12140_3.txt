<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful 'feeling' for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can not get memorable performances from this 'List', then the problem is in This movie it must be attributed to an unfortunate address and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after I liked "Angels & Insects" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can hardly believe how boring this was. It simply went on again and again and nobody was able to save the poor. This is not even a good movie of pretty clothes girls for intriguing dudes and young foreigners! <br /> <br /> "Tea With Mussolini" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
