This film deviated from the Bible and fell so far below the level of the 1956 film. I hate that they have replaced the 2006 film on the 10 traditionally seen commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind man Charelston Heston in the 1956 film. I will not waste my time watching this movie. They worked so hard to modernize this film to keep it on edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one). I am pretty sure that the youngest who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but to each his own. In addition, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took them 2 months to do this. The special effects were not as amazing as the first and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought that now they would have improved.
