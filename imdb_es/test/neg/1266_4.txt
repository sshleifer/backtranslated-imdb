He was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press he had read about her. Even around three-quarters of the way, I still thought he was confused and a bit incoherent, but otherwise, a solid story coming to its conclusion. And then the fund fell. Not necessarily wanting to ruin the movie for anyone, but the conclusion changes everything you considered as a fact about what and when things have been going on in your head, for no particular reason, except perhaps to tell the world, yes, I'm fine, and I know. I love a good spin, I love a good time ah-ha, but only when it's relevant to the story in question. The lack of complete orientation on the part of the filmmakers is useless in the general story, the deadlines did not have to be parallel and it was not necessary to separate them for a week. All that the revelation did was destroy whatever merit it was about to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which may be good, because looking back, it was not a film as solid as the one that was initially going to give it blindly. credit for. <br /> <br /> It is an admirable thing to try to make the term translate into the public's awareness of the film, but I needed a story that delved more deeply into the connotations and politics involved, rather than glosses . on those topics for a story of a woman in distress over the disappearance of her husband and the rebellion full of anguish of a daughter against her father "interrogator". I understand that the assistant of the film of the bottom line needs a human quality to understand and, for that reason, it is not my fault to go down that road. My only drawback is that we do not get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, we are shown many lines of the plot, all confusedly brought to the forefront before being returned to the lower regions of our consciousness, which we will never return. Are so many things happening that they forget what they are supposed to take care of, the wife? the interrogator The agent of the CIA? the victim? the senator The daughter of the Middle East and her fanatical boyfriend? In the end, I simply gave up and let the film take me where I was going, which ended up being a totally different person than the one I was presenting for the first time. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens as a result of a bomb. explosion. This bomb is at the center of every thread of the story and, finally, it ends up being so innocuous that you can not believe how huge the waves were. The old butterfly flutter date is in full force, because a child's revenge mission ends up destroying the lives of so many. Either by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or professional suicide; Nobody really escapes unharmed. However, at the end of the day, only the story about the man who has been withdrawn to Egypt by torture is really interesting. We are convinced that he is unmistakably innocent from the start, however, he is coined, electrocuted, etc. to extract any information you may have. When those in power include a man without compassion or reason to stop until something spills (whether true or not), and an observer without the guts to participate or stop, the situation lends itself some intrigue in As to how I could end. The three actors involved, all are the best parts of the film and demonstrate once again that the film should have cared for them in their entirety. <br /> <br /> I do not want to belittle people like Reese Witherspoon, (the wife of the victim, or his former Senate employee, played by Peter Sarsgaard, because they actually do a good job with what they are given. Even Meryl Streep, his nutty accent and Alan Arkin do not diminish too much, however, it's the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogator and Omar Metwally's victim that really shines. Egyptian who tries to stay sharp like a razor during working hours, but compassionate and full of worry like a father trying to locate his daughter, this man is brutal, but he is because that is what his occupation demands and for what is he trusted to find answers ... Metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted on him, whether he is lying or does not really know anything about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone We accept your situation completely and hope desperately to see how the situation turns out. As for Gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have a recycled performance throughout his career with varying degrees of success, finds a part that suits him. The demons that enter your soul throughout the ordeal are forced to be part of the wear and tear of your body and mind, which causes ambivalence and the need to intervene. The two feelings fight each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic and youthful attitude fits perfectly into that battle. <br /> <br /> It is simply a pity that the only plot that works never finds itself as the main focal point, despite being the namesake of the film. With all the clutter around the edges, we, as a public, bounce too much, we calm down in a sense of time and sequence, and then we slap them in the face while everything unravels more in a laugh over us than a "bet" I did not see it coming. "I felt cheated and, unfortunately, that is the lasting effect that I have taken from the film.If it had been simpler, I could have enjoyed it more, but as it is, one can still take some positive aspects of the seriously defective.
