The film begins when we watch a video of a great drought in the 30s in the United States. Then there is a short story about a scary-looking farmer, Elija, who made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elija hired young people to work in their garden, killed them and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the soil with his blood. Some time after 2 police officers come to visit him. Choose one of them gets shot by Choose, another kills the farmer ... After that, it is shown today, and a guy named Sean is told he has an old farm left as an inheritance. He decides to go there with some friends to see what happens. Little did Sean know that the next night is the "Payback Night" ..... <br /> <br /> As for me, this movie had a good story for a horror movie, but the low budget and the poor special effects ruined that. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of making lazy movies. For example, we see a scarecrow (a normal guy with a funny and cheap mask) chasing a girl. When you raise your hand, we see normal human skin under your glove, instead of a bit of rotten flesh. The gore is not very impressive either. There are some unpleasant murders by our "charming" scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, acting is a good thing in this movie, or rather I say it is credible. Some nude scenes are also presented to fans (even a lesbian scene), but those scenes do not save it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: good music, good story, solid acting. But the terrible effects, the cheap blood and the holes of the plot slow down this movie. It really is not recommended.
