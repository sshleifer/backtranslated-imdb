The only enigma in this movie was how it was made. The British film industry needs to make films that people really want to see and not get money from Taxpayers (to the BBC) to keep the Luvvies in their lifestyle they have been used to, without doing anything about it. <br /> <br /> the film was wrong with British Films, it was based on stereotypes, it had to be a London where the people were Posh and corrupt, Gangsters, Luvvies or gawd jelled the types of eels, the script the story was pathetically weak. To the extent that the policeman pulled out his phone and the ringtone was the "Sweeney" theme, he expected it. The whole movie was a happy buyer / Minder scam. <br /> <br /> The incalculable manuscript that I noticed was left behind and lost in some occasions and it is something that neither I, with my limited street wisdom, would not carry. in my pocket, everywhere, to the beach and fights, etc. Saying Vinnie Jones is nice, that's the only thing in the movie, poor guy. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi entered the water at the end. because he was Dickens, oh my God, what the fuck, and I'm being positive here
