Historically horrible. Hardly a precise moment in 4 hours of ridiculousness. One can not keep track of inconsistencies while looking. As with all track and file movies, no one bothers to ask for track consultants. It shows the events and techniques that were not created until the next century. From the shots of runners who ran in 400 meters to the overweight actor portraying the high jump and the long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about the track to be slightly entertained. They launched together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the Los Angeles Olympics.
