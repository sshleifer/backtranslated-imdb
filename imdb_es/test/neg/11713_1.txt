I saw this movie in a show that showed bad B movies and tried to buy them. Basically, it was just a long trailer, but it gave you a very good idea of ​​what the movie was. After watching the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but it could still be entertaining in a wicked way. IT IS NOT ENTERTAINMENT in any sense of the word. The movie has two things (or should I say four) and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women. They are hot and naked a lot and Mrs. Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on T & A and cheesy dialogues. This is not even a horror or fear movie, unless you're talking about watching the actors try to act. The value of production is pathetic, the performance is worse and the writing is the worst. What was the point of making this movie? To scare people? To steal the "Texas massacre"? To try to be fun? To show off the breasts of women? To put a boy's head in a delayed suit, with false hands and legs? To have a character just say the word "snow" over and over again? Do not have real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact that there is no real plot? To be able to make a sequel to a movie that nobody has seen or will ever see? I made a mistake when picking up this movie, do not make this mistake too. <br /> <br /> MOVE AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
