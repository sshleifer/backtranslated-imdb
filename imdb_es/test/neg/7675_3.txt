"Oh, you pilots are such men." "They do not call it the cockpit for nothing, honey." Dialogue like that is just one of the many reasons why The Concorde? The Airport '79 (or, if you saw it in the UK where it was dragging its heels to be launched there, Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the youngest in the series. The disaster movie was in a desperate situation at the end of the 70s, with The Swarm offering a lot of involuntary hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, When Time Out Out and City on Fire simply offering a lot of boredom and the desperation to find a new twist in the genre It is very evident here. This time it's a conspiracy plot, with Susan Blakely's news anchor discovering that billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner has been selling weapons to terrorists and the North Vietnamese. Naturally, she decides to tell him everything instead of making the story public, but he frustrates her by explaining: "I am a very rich man, I have everything in life I could wish for, why would I put him in danger by doing something?" so incredibly stupid? "In case she does not buy that line, instead of, for example, hiring an assassin to kill her on the ground, he decides to do things intelligently by planning to destroy the Concorde while flying to Moscow through Paris. "I have done many things that I have been ashamed of, but I am not a murderer," he insists indignantly on his way to reprogram a guided missile to destroy the plane, therefore, nothing incredibly stupid there, and when that fails, he sends a hunt a reaction behind him, and when that fails? <br /> <br /> Do not even think about looking for something that resembles the logic here: this is something real in the bottom of the barrel that even the studio abandoned and commercialized like a comedy in the US after critics laughed off the screen, where the previous three entries had the look of brilliant big-budget entertainments, this friendly small-screen effort (the only one that was not filmed on screen 2.35: 1 wide) does not even make the Concorde look good, which is quite a feat. Television veteran David Lowell Rich presumably got the job of direction because he was fast, cheap and had previously directed the television movie SST : Disaster in the sky where the Peter Graves supersonic plane was unable to land due to the sabotage and the Senegalese flu (which was not intentionally, at least, a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and It seemed the natural choice for what looks like a $ 14 million TV movie that somehow escaped to the theaters when no one was watching. <br /> <With the cast as a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are scarce this time, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been surrounded by rehab clinics and comedies. Alain Delon gives the Hollywood race one last chance as a pilot, "Happy Fish" (do not ask). George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the passenger seat in hopes of reminding people of the other movies, while The rest of the set includes a pair of veterans of The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel, trying to be respectable), a regular of Ingmar Bergman (Bibi Andersson and she is the only one who plays the hooker!), The navigator of David Warner on a diet with nightmares about being chased by bananas, the voice del Diablo (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and his Eye Observer of Chihuahua ("Dohn take me from my mouth"), Martha Raye and his weak bladder, Jimmy Walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking marijuana in the juan (in the few moments when it is not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson says goodbye to her credibility as the obligatory mother with a very sick girl and an icy heart in the upper locker. Eddie Albert, owner of the airline and trophy wife Sybil Danning who occupies the best seat in the house, Ed Begley Jr with glasses, and the Russian Olympic team and his adorable trainer Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhh!) In a tour of goodwill by the United States (who knew about the boycott?). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to the proceedings, Harry Shearer expresses a news report in the same tones he then used for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? Despite the improvised wedding ceremony during a forced landing, it only has to be George Kennedy deflecting a missile in search of heat by opening the window, taking out his arm (at almost twice the speed of sound!) And firing a flare ? While the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the motors so that there is no "heat source" for the missiles to approach? Yes, someone was really paid to write this, and that someone was future Oscar winner and screenwriter from Munich and The Insider Eric Roth (well, everyone has to start somewhere), although in his defense was the producer Jennings Lang who came up with plot. Still, what do you expect from a movie that credits acrobatics in the air and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying toward sunset? Surprisingly, in one of them it would not admit moments of defeat in the studies that used to be prone, Universal recorded about 20 minutes more or less of images a couple of years later to include them in the television programs of the network (not included in the DVD). Unfortunately, its failure at the box office led to the fifth entry in the series, the uproar that would have been the 1984 Airport: UFO, never taking off. Even more genuinely tragic, it was the Concorde used in this film that crashed in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo says to his Chihuahua in a Spanish without a subtitle when it's not, allowed on board, it's "What do you think? Do not worry. revolution, I promise you that you will fly in whatever you want, I promise, what a shame, my love, what do they think they are? ")
