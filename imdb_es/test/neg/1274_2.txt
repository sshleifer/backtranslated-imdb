I will give you this: he tried. He tried to do well and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. It can not compensate for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were poorly developed. <br /> <br /> The "gag" that ran with the bully was stupid. It was never funny and I got tired of the gag very fast. And the barefoot boy was also a little weak. Hitchhiked to Florida? If it is okay. <br /> <br /> The movie felt like a movie for average kids sometimes with this stressed mantra: stupid adults, smart kids. And that part becomes boring. <br /> <br /> But the only moments that were fun were when the police car Wilson drove when he lost his patrol car. I loved that cart, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But, apart from that, nothing else was worth my time. "RE-"
