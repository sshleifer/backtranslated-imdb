A friend of mine loves sticky horror movies, so I often see low budget things like this. This is, however, the first time I've been forced to write a review of one ... <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The full budget for the film seems to have been spent in a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus is in this chamber and becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about it is that it was really fun after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
