This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life. I have not seen it for a long time, but the jokes are NOT funny, the plot is painfully predictable, calling the main characters stupid is greatly improving their intelligence ... uggh! I just wanted to punch Tom Arnold and make him cry because he lost two hours of my life when I finished seeing this piece of cinematic filth. I do not even know why I wanted to see it, but remember that if you watch this movie: DO NOT SAY YOU DID NOT WORRY. <br /> <br /> PS The character of Tom Arnold sings a song in this movie called "I am my own grandfather". Nuff said.
