This is the story of a news investigator who hates his work, which proves why the actors, even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington, are on the big screen and their neighbors are not. <br /> <br /> I'll say this, however, the best moments show some basis to be really fun (not just extravagant), keep trying, maybe take some classes and use the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's My Car" and the "Scary Movie" sequence have it all about this ... college attempt.) <br /> <br /> Lighting was not; The production was not; and the script had moments (conversation from space - very nice attempt at unconvincing execution). (This reminded me of "Dark Star," which is about being "lost in space," but this movie is lost.) <br /> <br /> The talent was the bartender (he said "dog" so annoying that I knew he had to be acting ... was not he? I guess I gave the movie a point for each of them. .. 3/10. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
