The first time I saw this movie, I thought it would be a good rally, since it had my favorite actor of all time. He gives an excellent performance, although it is quite obvious that he did not have to live more than half a finger to make the role work. He is the only good thing about him, unless you are interested in explosions and garbage from the hero of the working class of the dreams of the United States (which I am not). <br /> <br /> I do not understand it. How can this movie get away with being so naf? That part with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on! You can not tell me that they would have rescued him without the fireman wearing protective glasses (I know for a fact that it would have been very dark there and you could not see more than a couple of feet in front of you) and no breathing equipment (he would have drowned after 2 minutes!). This movie was bad, okay? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
