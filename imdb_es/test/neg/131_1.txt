Breaking Dawn begins at a California university when Professor Simon (Associate Producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they should conduct an intensive six-week study of a mental patient at Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, they will fail and they never will. become qualified doctors A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and he is a convicted murderer; he was found covered in blood, in addition to the corpse of a woman (Diane Verona) and her daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first, Don will not even look at Eve, let alone talk to her, but like the soldier she is, Eve persists in trying to decipher it. Finally, Don begins to speak, but what he says scares Eve, says that someone is looking at her and mentions the name of Malachay. Then, Eve begins to see a dark and shadowy figure at each step, as Don produces the conspiracy theories and the strange statements. Little by little, Eva begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there anything else in the supposed nonsense that Don talks about something other than being the uproar of a psychiatric patient ...? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good ending, the kind of end that surprises us, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film and remains in our memory as the great endings of The Sixth Sense (1999) and Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples and, to a lesser extent, the end of films like Scream (1996) where the identity of the murderer is a good surprise and it is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are movies whose endings ruin everything that has happened before and as an example, let's take, oh, I do not know, say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a horrible ending to a movie, ever. Breaking Dawn begins as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things that start to happen to Eve, it's not the most action-packed movie of all time, but it's interesting, it's not the most compelling movie, but it's More than what You can see, and it is not so bad a movie until the end of the turn, I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that moment (which was fine to be fair) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people who think they have this confusing mess of an end resolved to the last detail, all I can say is that no one can explain this to me satisfactorily and until now. As far as I'm concerned, it does not make any sense and it never will. Breaking Dawn is a shit and it is a waste of time to see it to be rewarded with the last end in the history of cinema, it is as simple and direct as this one. <br /> <br /> Director Robinson does not make a mess. what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought that what he had filmed would work well or maybe it was ruined in the editing room, but I guess it's more likely to be a garbage script when he tries to tie all absurdities together in the space of a few confusing minutes and give everyone a final shot happier than happy. It increases the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes, but it is useless at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Technically Breaking Dawn is fine and in general it is well done. The performance is quite good, Overton is nice and pleasing to the eye and offers a decent performance. Was it just me or the guy who played Don looked like John Morghen, star of Italian sleaze classics like Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) ), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) and The Church (1989)? Well, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Dawn is silly, I hated it all for the last few minutes. Do not get me wrong, it was not exactly what excited me until then, but it was fine. Definitely, you have to avoid it as far as I'm concerned, although it seems you have a good amount of positive comments in the IMDb ...
