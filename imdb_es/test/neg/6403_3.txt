So, this starts with at least one interesting and promising basic idea, follows and continues with the tension, Carey in a good atypical role but in a performance lower than expected, the weak direction of Joel Schumacher coincides with some holes in the plot, the "Detective Scenes" show us the fate of creativity. If you do not have high expectations (due to negative reviews) you may enjoy this. In the end, they offer us a lesson on morality (for those who remember "Falling Down") and "Family Joy and Cure" that ruins any possibility of being nice and find the movie that can be seen in P.S. It is obvious who is the "murderer"! I wonder why W.Sparrow (Carey) did not solve the mystery from the beginning of the film ...
