The premise of Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds great! However, Ade Edmonson and Rik Mayall have managed to create a film that barely increases the titter. Ten years ago, the crazy look of Rik Mayall and the idiocy of Ade were fun, now they are just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film was promising, although the most horrible hotel in Britain is not a new idea, but it failed. . The saving graces were competent interpretations of Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the movie is only 90 minutes long. I'm sorry, guys, but they really hit the bottom
