'Northfork' is what is wrong with independent films. Despite all his harsh comments and the big issues that attack the studios, this is the sacrifice we make. For almost two hours I was subjected to the torture and pain of a movie that starts wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends up without covering any new land and fortunately dies. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories That detail a dying people and a dying child. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must force the remaining inhabitants of Northfork to leave before a dam is opened and floods the city. The other story has a child returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave it to the parents. He is dying and is visited, I suppose, by the angels. Among them, Anthony Edwards with strange shows and Daryl Hannah with a strange suit that reminds me of Seinfeld's pirate shirt. <br /> <br /> Although this is the "plot", it is not what the film is about. The movie is about nothing. It does not do anything, it does not say anything, it does not go anywhere and it has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely a side effect of the pretentious, surreal, aspiring David Lynch: we are an important artistic film that you can not see, direction style. The whole film is filtered through a gray and gloomy background that, I suppose, fits into a film about death. Instead, it simply makes the movie much harder to see. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, see any of the films of 'Men in black', or too impressive, but compared with 'Northfork' they rise to the status 'Citizen Kane'. If you want to see a movie about a dying child, look at the 'Lorenzo Oil'. If you want to see a movie that has the destruction of a city through the water, look 'O Brother, where are you?' If you want to see a movie better than 'Northfork', there are hundreds. If you want to see a movie that is worse, there is only a handful. 0 * out of ****
