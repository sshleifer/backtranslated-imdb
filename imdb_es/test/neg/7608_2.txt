I saw a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits in this movie are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I guess it was an alternative title. Dark Talon was not as fun as everyone else here says. The performance was lame, the editing neglected, and generally stupid. At first, there is an annoying song from the 1970s called "Benson, Arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Basically, the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that circulates through unstable bombing sites. The pumps are sensitive and respond to people. Compulsory disaster interrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew comes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that makes no sense at all. The movie I saw was made in less than an hour and a half, with advertisements, so I suspect that Dark Talon is an overdue version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> The alien is an inflatable spray shaped like red beach ball Painted with a pair of monstrous hands on which he walks. It was nonsense and it was not convincing as an extraterrestrial. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that John Carpenter had anything to do with this. His other films were much better.
