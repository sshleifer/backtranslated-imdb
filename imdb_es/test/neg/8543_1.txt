Franco's films can be divided into 4 categories: the "beginnings" (often in black and white and inventive), the "fools" (late sixties / early seventies that often involve Soledad Miranda), the "nudes" (from various eras, but using female frontal nudity as a plot unit) and "the rest". <br /> <br /> This is part of the "rest". It's not really a cannibal movie at all. It's certainly not gorefest. The few women in the photo do not even lose their loin clothes and there is little frontal thing at all. The picture quality on the German DVD that I saw is poor. The film disappears (to the extent that it catches fire). As a Franco fan, I would tell others not to bother. Do something more with your time ... read a book ... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... anything really ...
