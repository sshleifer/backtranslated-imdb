This is a horrible version of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine in which someone (Sinise? Bates?! Butler?! What did they think? !!) there are no writing credits (or talent) in their name to translate the themes for the American audiences, who both agreed that they are stupid, stupid, stupid, then recruited other friends to register, and they did as friends, certainly not because of the merits of this pathetically devised script, everything but the kitchen. <br /> <br /> I'm not, he's a fan of the French film, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, reflective and stimulating treatment of sensitive cultural issues, I'd love to see it expand more widely among the English-speaking public, and If that means a new American version, so be it But puh-leeze, a little respect for the themes And the intelligence of the audience, and a better direction for the actors, it seems they could not decide if they were working for Tennessee Willi ams or Jerry Lewis.
