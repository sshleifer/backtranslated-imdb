A rather dreadful enterprise suggests that the Welshman is a child artist, who feels helpless in the face of the violent environment he knows best, but can not resist empty elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a meaningless and meaningless journey with a premiere of science fiction film series B. The second achieved some shock, but only through the excess of humiliation that induces the scandal in its central character. The third and more laughable seems to aspire to be a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The management has no idea: all sound and fury, a slave to the extremely unpleasant environment; suffocating in a badly chosen music and in an indifferent and showy performance. This is pure stupidity disguised as guerrilla sensibility, as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections.
