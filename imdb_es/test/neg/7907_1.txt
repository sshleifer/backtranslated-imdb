Frankly, I did not think there was anything funny in this movie. It was really lame and badly done without any plot. Surprisingly, I got some laughs from me at the beginning with the Malcolm X terminal and that was it. Seriously Soul Plane made even the worst movies like Gigli look like an Emmy winner. It is not worth watching this movie unless, of course, you were blind like Johnny Witherspoon, who played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). I shrugged off most of the stereotyped jokes and ruined Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by casting them in this movie. This movie could be summarized in a single sentence. Nashawn earns $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could rate this film in the negative integers, however, the beginning was fun, which leads to this film to a 1/10. Making the "t bag" pfft!
