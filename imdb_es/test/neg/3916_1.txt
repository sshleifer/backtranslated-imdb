Oh darling! Ohdear! Ohdear! Ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... er ... 'film' only puts shame on space films. Every science fiction movie that I have seen during the last YEAR has been disappointing to a certain extent, and now I am seriously reconsidering what genre of films I like in the future. (Maybe I'll watch romantic movies from now on!) <br /> <br /> ALERT THE SPOILERS! (And that does not say much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupidly silly that it competes with Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses for pure evil. The special effects are obviously fake, the Big Mac Truck looked stupid with its roller coaster seats, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked out of the port hole window first and . .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do better than this. What really stung were the two beautiful young people who accompanied him and ran in nothing but his underpants (??) for two-thirds full of the movie! The obligatory 'sex scene' (giggle!) Among our young heroes was so poor that I almost choked on my tonsils laughing at the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain / cyborg / mad scientist. I used to say the word grotesque and it was predictably weak, but I think it could have been much more threatening. He does and says things that are quite funny (all the best scenes involve him!) So for the captain I give an extra point to this movie. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so bad it will make you want to. To throw abuses on television or maybe throw your TV out the window! It can even kill some brain cells and put you in a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain struggles to walk on his peg leg when it's obviously a false peg leg! I would have given him 0 out of 10, but since he breaks me with his stupid pranks ... this movie is 1/10!
