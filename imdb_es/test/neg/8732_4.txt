The second incursion of Rock Hudson in the genre of science fiction after Seconds is Embryo, a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion in a rather strange film about the lack of a better word: a test-tube baby that grows and becomes Barbara Carrera. <br /> <br /> Hudson is a scientist who is experimenting on organic development and has the opportunity to first experience with his own Doberman Pincher when he is accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some of the dog's pituitary secretions are given to a premature puppy and it becomes remarkably an adult. Exalted by his success, Hudson takes a fetus from an accident victim and gives him some of the same things. <br /> <br /> What you get is Barbara Carrera. And she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious pace. What she does not do is develop emotionally. Hudson still passes her as his new research assistant to friends and family, such as sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> The embryo does not explore some of the real problems in this type of science, but exploits them. The special effects as they are, are pretty second class. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project halfway through the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, what would have really been interesting is if I had had a son and grew up to become a hero of the harlequin novel. Now that would have been something Rock Hudson could have sunk his teeth into.
