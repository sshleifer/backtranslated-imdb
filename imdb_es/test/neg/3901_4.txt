Do not be fooled by the other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive variety of talents, the material they present leaves much to be desired. The 3 numbers of Nat King Cole are quite boring and are not even close to his later efforts, although he impresses with his piano. "Mam√°s" Mabley is not a bit funny, although I remember her as a very entertaining guest of my youth. Actually, the best performances are of a couple of fat people who impress with a lively tap dance and a takeoff of Four Tops, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number that presents the bass player. The impression itself is of very poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally wasted in the enveloping plot.
