This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo" should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horror movie; but what I got was a boring and standard "ghost draws vegece." In this case, the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment, but his plea was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: her spirit possesses nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. The only voodoo connection was with one of the three black characters, in this case a former blind soccer player, whose mother practiced voodoo. The movie is very slow and boring. There is a very standard ending that provides excitement, followed by a horribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which a woman manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed. This movie is slow and bad in a non-fun, simply amazing way. Avoid at all costs.
