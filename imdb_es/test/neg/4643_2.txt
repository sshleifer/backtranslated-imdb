I know that Full Moon, or any other movie studio, could never recover the funny and cheesy sci-fi feeling that was the original "Trancers". And with the last two entries in the series having Jack Deth in medieval times instead of the futurists in Los Angeles, it became quite obvious that there really was little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Breathing new life into a movie is one thing, but getting our main character out of your element and putting it in the past, well, it did not work! So now with Trancers 6, Full Moon has given so much new life to the series that we do not even deal with Jack Deth anymore. Now we take care of your daughter, Jo. Jack is in his body and must go to the past and fight the Trancers once more. <br /> <br /> * LOWER SPOILER: FIRST SCENE REVEALED FROM THE MOVIE * <br /> <br /> To prove the bad thing This movie is, you only need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack appears Deth on the screen. But it's not really Tim Thomerson. They are clips of him and sound bytes attached (trust me, you can see they are together) horribly to provide the viewer with the last of Jack Deth's true humor. And from this moment, things only go downhill. Having this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character, while Jack Deth is supposed to be in his body, is the worst idea in the world. Making this cute young woman act like a rough and tough man is not the right way! It does not work and it really becomes stupid. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the aspects of special effects and makeup, because most of those who are reading this know what Full Moon has become: Really, low budget company. I do not know what to say about this movie, except that I really wish that the Full Moon could be like in the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Back then, while special effects were not great, Storytelling was. They made serious series films for fans of horror films and series B, and that does not happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I long for the good times, and I really hope that the Full Moon can come out of this horrible depression in which they are now. <br /> <br /> The trancantes 6 get 2 out of 10.
