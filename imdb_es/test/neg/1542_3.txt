There is something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere within that Hollywood formula there is a good movie that tries to appear. However, when the credits accumulate, it can not be saved. Everything is more or less affected by the "police side" of the story, where the characters of homicide detectives Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin mingle in an uncomfortable sexual relationship that becomes more and more trivialized as the film continues. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it is not enough to save the mediocre script and the lazy rhythm. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (improved much earlier in the year in the underestimated 'Birthday Girl'), as well as in Chris Penn, who has such a small role that, unfortunately, he feels sorry for a talent As the. Anyway, the plot really is not a factor in this movie at all. The two teenage killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work quite well and they play pretty well. It's a shame they were not in a much better versatile film. Barbet Schroeder is stepping on too safe ground here for such an experienced filmmaker. Conclusion: it's worth a rent if you're a fan of the genre, but everyone else will live a full life without even seeing it, except maybe on the TV network with convenient commercial breaks.
