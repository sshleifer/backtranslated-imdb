Problems: 1) Although it is listed as "a loving tribute to Poverty Row," many of the old images are not even from the Poverty Row films, many of them from "The Most Dangerous Game" by RKO (1932), with some of the silent version (!?) of "The Lost World" (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Much of the old images are used only as filler (the old images of the ship) or as silent shots (for example, from Bela walking, looking or watching) often repeated; <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of the Godparents of the Row of Poverty? (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) like his fists. lines to the "new" character jokes (like in "How about Tiger Lily?" by Woody Allen or "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" by Steve Martin)? Even Mike Nelson's weak comment on the color "Reefer Madness" is more fun than this. <br /> <br /> High Point: the long but extremely instructive conference by Gregory Mank that makes you give a new respect and admiration for Bela, John Carradine and George Zucco. That's worth the price of the DVD alone!
