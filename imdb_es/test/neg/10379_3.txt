An exorcism exercise of numbers with a disappointing lack of loyalty and use of the term "black water". The cinematography appears directly from the basic terrain of MOW by cable, which eliminates any appearance of cloudy and turbid atmosphere of the process. In addition, there is not enough gore, sex or attractive young things to satiate most of the viewers to whom the film is directed. That said, the main actress who plays the possessed has a sexy presence of olive skin. What else is there to say about this non-winner? Do not rent unless you have something for middle-aged adults to regret their past and show off with clich√©s, they shrink, the stable Hispanics regret their past actions.
