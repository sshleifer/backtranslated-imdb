My first question, is NOT about the horrible performance, NOT about the horrible writing, it is the address. The choices made about cinematography are some of the worst decisions I've seen. Why should every bad man have to die in slow motion? I was about to hit me with a rubber hose. The camera shots make you unable to see what is happening. I was about to turn off the movie due to the accent of Jalal Merhi, when he came to the sex scene, so I thought I could improve, well, it was not like that. If you rate the special effects on a rating scale A, B, C, I would have to put it around a W or something, did I mention the performance? Wow, it was bad! And the WORST part of the whole "Wait to Die" experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE MATRIX ONLY HAD BAD." comparing this movie with the Matrix is ​​easily the WORST comparison I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it, unless you're looking for a good reason to bang your head against the wall.
