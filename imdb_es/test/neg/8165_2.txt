Maybe it gets better. I would not know. I did it for the first twenty minutes or so before I cut it and entered into a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. One man, Paul LeMatt, a professor of etymology at Columbia, drives his dog to a small town in Ohio in search of his ex-wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but there's something underneath. <br /> <br /> That kind of arrangement is the home for filmmakers and spectators, and it's full of possibilities. It can become a commercial success carefully drawn as "Bad Day at Black Rock". Or I would have done, and probably did, a good episode of "Twilight Zone". <br /> <br /> The cast also includes some experienced artists, as well as some formerly prominent names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, is a superficially friendly motel manager. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance, as she did in, say, "Silkwood." For some of the others, their range is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is misdirected and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Example of address in poor condition. That LeMatt dog does not like Kenneth Toby, from the beginning. Then, when LeMatt goes out, Toby goes to the window of his room, looks at the dog and something goes away. Cut to LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog howling. Then a POV shot of presumably the dog advancing towards LeMatt and then passed by while the wind blows and LeMatt looks at the camera. Cut to an identical shot, coming from the other direction! Whatever the camera represents, whatever LeMatt is looking at, it never shows. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone in the street, a little disconcerted. "You should never have brought that dog in first," says a smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What the hell is that scene? <br /> <br /> Example of writing in poor condition. Well, TWO examples. (1) If he sat and wrote a stereotyped waitress in a restaurant in a small town, without the exercise of any trade, he would think of an expressionless baby with his hair piled on his head, chewing gum. , walking between the tables. Right. (2) Everything that resembles credibility is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops, then explodes while waiting to be repaired in the garage. Stopping: credible. Explosion: supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would support such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Something is going wrong in the small town of Dr. Kevin McCarthy, and half of the film takes time to unravel the mystery, and all the time the suspense increases and the doubt grows. Here, twenty minutes into the movie, a stranger enters a motel room and rips off his plastic face, revealing a naked, pulsing brain that emits light. Pregnancy is aborted. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you the end because I do not know what it is, nor do I care. I suppose it had something to do with insects because, why else would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who runs their classes?) But I'm not even sure there are insects involved. It is entirely possible that the insect business was adventitious. It is possible that the writers have turned him into an insect specialist and then they have forgotten him. I would not be surprised
