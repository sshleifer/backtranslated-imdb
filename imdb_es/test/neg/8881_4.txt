Then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film skipped many years later with French France in power. The movie does little to inform you about what happened, and I do not remember much about it. Then, the movie becomes confusing then. The film begins when Ines, daughter of a wealthy merchant, is accused of Jewishness by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. They question her and force her to confess. Even the wealth of his family can not buy it out of prison. His father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession that he is the son of a chimpanzee, in the hope that they will release Ines. All he does is give a reason for the church to condemn Lorenzo, who flees to France. <br /> <br /> Then, the film skips many years, and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines leaves the prison. It was a very good makeup job to make Natalie Portman look so torn. She finds her dead family and looks for Goya for her help. She tells him that she had a son in prison. Goya establishes a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He is the father Goya sees the daughter and tells Lorenzo, who decides that it is better to send her to America, so that no one finds out. But before their plans are carried out, the British join the Spanish, and Spain claims the power and now it is the persecuted one. That part is not well told in the movie. It's like the movie shows that this happens in a day. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: The movie is good until it jumps many years after the Inquisition, then the movie hopes you understand what is happening. Then I got too confused.
