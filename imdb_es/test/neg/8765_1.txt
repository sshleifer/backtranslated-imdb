This movie was terrible. The acting was horrible. The script was horrible. What was even worse were the shots and the sound of the camera. Half the time the voices did not match the lips of the actors, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different tones. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was on top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to be 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of him in another shot, they had "recreated" the top part of the building. The width of the building had been reduced to about eight feet wide. How could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? I know that the movie was low budget, but it is inexcusable. The film itself only pushed ideas about a "rapture" and then actually had a story or a point. This reduced the script to mere garbage, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines instead of transmitting emotions and moving the film in one direction. It was a complete waste of time observing. The film gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the best current Christian films.
