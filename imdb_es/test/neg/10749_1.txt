I do not agree 100% with the critic who did not agree with the critic who gave this film a rating of "F". Taking advantage of political propaganda largely only hides Joe Dante's inability to get another Howl out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrific stories, except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite being acclaimed by those who wish to promote their political leanings, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH. Season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, which comes neither to horror nor to humor in its implacable delivery of a trite political point. <br /> <br /> Dante can only be blamed for removing this stench from the shelf, since it was not his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular in this decade, and between George Romero's harvest of predictable tributes and empty fantasies is a series of works designed to drive political or (ir) religious messages. Such works are not written or intended for true fanatics of horror. Maybe Dante really is not a Horror Master, either. What have you been doing since The Howling, after all? <br /> <br /> If you want a zombie movie against the war with some pop culture references that pose as humor, Homecoming can be your thing. If you are a horror fan who is looking for something masterful, take again ... most episodes of the series. My personal favorite was "Jenifer" by Dario Argento, loosely based on a short classic comedic from Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson's team, really creepy.
