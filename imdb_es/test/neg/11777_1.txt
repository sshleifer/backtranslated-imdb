I looked at this piece ONDEMAND because the description was somewhat extravagant. This movie reeks of cocaine, the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in the movie. This is a piece of racist and homophobic trash that advances slowly for 1 hour and 22 minutes without any direction. I'm a little confused about how this has good reviews here. I will not bother telling you the plot line because, as far as I can tell, there is no plot. I'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set every day, they made giant lines, dressed Loretta Switt with pronounced necklines to show as many flapjack blowjobs as possible and shouted action; Letting the cast improvise in a frenzy of cocaine. Like real beer, this movie almost caused my liver to fail by half. Save your money and see 'Strange Brew' instead.
