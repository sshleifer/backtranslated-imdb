This movie was a big disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the hasty introduction of a rather lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all the loose ends. Unfortunately, it was not like that. He added more holes in the plot than he solved, and he confused more than he clarified. The animation and the voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, a boring scenario (most of the film does not even take place in the dreary Earth of World War II instead of the world of Alchemy), and a disappointing end (Ed is useless for the rest of his life). days in a world without alchemy, and get rid of Winry?), everything was quite tarnished. Do yourself a favor: ignore the last half of the anime, as well as this movie, and read the manga.
