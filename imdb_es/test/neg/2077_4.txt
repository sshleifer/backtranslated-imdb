Carmen is a prostitute who lives seducing and stealing soldiers from the Spanish army; She is, without a doubt, the best fatal woman of the moment. When a man resists his charming attentions, she decides to do everything possible to destroy him. In the end, he falls on his website and will be forced to do all the things he once hated just for being with Carmen. Although Paz Vega is very beautiful, she does not seem gypsy (like Carmen) and neither her performance nor Sbaraglia's are good. The story is very boring and, in most of the moments, it is very absurd, while trying to seem truthful. in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects, in spite of not being, but they are not, but acceptable, and too artificial for a historical film as it is. In short, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are many better things to see.
