Even MST3K could not make this drek drek painful, long and ultimately fun or entertaining. While most bad movies in themselves are hilariously bad, this is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense. <br /> <br /> The element that makes this so STUPID to see is not the lack of history, but the fact that SOOOO has a lot of background builds up in the first half hour and is absolutely ridiculous and more difficult to follow that a road while driving without headlights. <br /> <br /> The hero of the movie, Ator, is nothing more than a visual appeal to this literal energy sucker of a movie. Dressed in a loin cloth and sporting "pectorals like melons", as Joel said, it belongs more to an exercise magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this ONLY to those who want to die, and I mean faithful followers of cheese. If you have an enemy, recommend them this movie. If you manage to overcome this, I congratulate you. You must be able to do it through anything.
