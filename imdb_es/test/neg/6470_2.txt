"It's as if this city has the power to take your brain out of your head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl, bored with her small mid-level city. Bored is until a woman is kidnapped and finds what she thinks are clues to the poor lady's whereabouts. Now, with the help of your precious cat 'D.C.' and an inept FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) must find her. <br /> <br /> That Darn Cat is a bad movie. He is quite silly and has a humor that often falls quite flat. There are, however, some outbreaks of talent in him. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance as 'Senga' was very funny. Here you lose yourself like the awkward FBI agent. However, he has a good scene when he imitates the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. Your character must be the most understanding father who has ever lived. This poor man is crushed by his expensive cigar, they arrest him for picking up his own cat and they get angry with his cunning wife and STILL does not get mad at his daughter for causing her all her problems. I wish my old man were like that. The only really good performance is that of Christina Ricci. She is entertaining as the always annoying Patti, but her occasional and very bad dialogue stops her performance. You could also recognize Peter Boyle (the young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old woman from Wings and Cliff of Cheers, in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would like to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I can not really recommend 1997's That Darn Cat. Some young children (under 8) can enjoy it a little, but everyone else should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest the family values ​​of Addams, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If you're looking for a fun family movie, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
