My guess is that the producers of this horror movie / low budget space wanted a serious movie, but the director had his heart set on a parody. So ... this is what we have. Located in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and full of characters and accessories since the 90s. The whole is an industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. Its use is AS-IS, so the controls consist of racks of old TV equipment. One place is obviously the employees' dining room and sports an old TV and VCR, as well as a water cooler with plastic jug. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines, discussing throughout history. The dialogue is replete with terms that are quite outdated even now ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but is the 30th century perhaps too retro? When the captain declares that the cargo of the ships is a load of coffins from "The Transylvanian station", you know that this is quite a post. It's a bit of Alien, part JasonX, shameless scam of all the best science fiction and horror titles. At one point, Casper VanDien even tells his pilot to "do it like that" with a serious face. This movie would have been better if they had let everyone run with the satire, but they keep trying to make the story serious ... maybe the supporters were on set that day. Anyway, it is not a bad killer of boredom if you are not too demanding. The FX are as good as the sets are bad.
