The performance made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. History is full of holes, holes and jumps, so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes do not make sense. There is no indication of character development. The score / soundtrack consists of approximately three songs, one in particular that is played in approximately 70% of the scenes. I'm glad that I only rented the movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to see some decent actors who give horrible performances. It seems that most of the budget was spent on putting some brand actors in this film less than bad. This movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, try to get excited and interested, but just when you think something is going to happen, you will be thrown into an unrelated scene and you will try to find out how you got there.
