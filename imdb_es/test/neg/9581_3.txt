Mount Godwin-Austin (also known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world, and if you believe that the evidence presented in this movie is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without being killed. "K2" is basically a movie of friends set in the incredibly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography shows a really impressive landscape, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a bore, and that is the guilt of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Lawyer Taylor Taylor (Michael Biehn) and her quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing on rock. During one of their trips, they meet another group of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is training for a next opportunity on the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold would love to tackle, but could never afford to do so. However, during his training career, two members of the Claibourne team are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold present themselves as possible substitutes. Despite the initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them the go-ahead and the couple is joining their team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul) is distressed that her husband is going to take such a dangerous climb, especially since he recently became a father. The tensions in the climbing team increase when Taylor repeatedly confronts another member of the group, the equally brazen and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself becomes increasingly ill as altitude sickness affects his body. Will the boys reach the top of K2, or is their search destined to end in disappointment, or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an excessively long time in the introduction of its somewhat unpleasant characters. Biehn is an adventurous, aggressive and aggressive guy, especially difficult to please, like Barry, the millionaire of mountaineering. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so bored that it becomes hard to believe that his wife may care that he is going to climb K2. Of course, she would be better if he never came back! Rounding out the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is as cheesy and exaggerated as any other role he has played. Is the story itself totally docile and disposable? Just a direct thread about the guys trying to get to the top of a mountain. A bit of male bonding has been introduced, but the whole secondary plot about Harold and his wife equals zero, and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas sound totally false. "K2" gets its few merits only from the impressive cinematography of Gabriel Berastain. During the Himalayan sequences, the scale and awe of the mountains are captured quite well. I am completely with the critic Kim Newman in this article, who said hilariously in the Empire magazine: "On this evidence, climbing K2 can not be more difficult to ignore." Very true, Kim, very true!
