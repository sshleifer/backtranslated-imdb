During a lifetime of watching and enjoying thousands of movies, Feeling Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** major movie with stars from the A list) that I've seen in my life. Without exception. This movie totally fails at all levels. It is badly photographed and edited. There is an uninspired performance, the kind in which actors seem bored in their minds. Just picking up paychecks, maybe? And worst of all, it seems that the dirty writing was written under the influence of some unpleasant substance that is only found in the sewers. I can not even begin to understand how the writer / director could have found someone to finance this project, let alone attract any of the stars that did it. I really want to be able to recover the time I wasted seeing this piece of garbage. If possible, I would have given this movie a rating of zero. Better yet, a negative number.
