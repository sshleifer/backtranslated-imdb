This movie is a big disappointment. The director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by the strong and powerful performances of the Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also relies on a talented actress, the newcomer Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala, but this is just the only positive element of a terrible disaster of a movie. While Lopez de Ayala endeavors to represent Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her handsome husband, it seems that he could not develop his character on this one-dimensional characteristic; Juana was an important figure in the history of Spain, and the politics of that time was essential in her story ... but here she is presented as a romantic protagonist of a soap opera; This is a real shame, and the film is a lost opportunity to show how personal lives can influence History and vice versa. The worst of all is that the Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri present bad performances, which, in the case of Liotti, is a real problem, since he plays Felipe el Hermoso, a fundamental role in this story. It seems a clear option to attract young audiences, since both are seen as the best models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors like Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasted on clearly underdeveloped support roles. Even if it was a big budget movie, not much care was taken to bring a good script or create "period pieces" on the screen. The costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they had been taken from archival material, without considering a real coherence. In general, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference with very superior historical films such as LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's point of view. This is a strange turn in Aranda's career, since he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIES and LOVERS come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA really is nothing more than an academic historical piece routine. And not very good at that!
