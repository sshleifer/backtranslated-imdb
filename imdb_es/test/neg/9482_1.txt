Ok I've seen this movie Someone has to kick me. WHY should the Olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this putrid torture? This was another movie about how to see the Olsen twins travel to an exotic place, meet some cute guys, look pretty and have them all drool over them. The direction, the development of the plot, and the performance. I do not know anything about the USA UU., But in my country it is considered extremely stupid to get on the bicycle of a boy you met, 10 minutes ago. Although now I am convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that some day we can see a movie with an original plot, even a little plausible.
