John Wayne is undoubtedly one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. His career spanned more than forty years, and in that time he starred in such films as "Angel and the Badman," "The Green Berets," "Sands of Iwo Jima," "Rio Bravo," "North to Alaska," and " The Undefeated ". <br /> <br /> The film mentioned above is considered one of his best works, unlike this 1934 effort "Randy Rides Alone", which has been practically forgotten as time passes, which is not surprising, as it is nothing memorable, apart from its brief execution time of only 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons that were never really explained, comes to a room in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. As he looks around, a gang arrives and finds Randy there, arresting him, accusing him of being a member of a gang and demanding to know where the rest of his gang is. He is imprisoned for the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the room and was murdered, arrives at the jail to see Randy in order to clarify that he was one of the members of the gang (She was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place). Sally does not think Randy is a murderer, and does not recognize him, so while the sheriff is out, he takes the keys and Randy escapes. While running away from the sheriff and his gang, Randy stumbles conveniently into the gang's hideout in a cave that was responsible for the murders. Randy intends to clear his name and also bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. But at the same time it has too many flaws that are impossible to ignore. The film is also extremely antiquated, as expected; we have the terrible shot of the camera that makes everyone look like they are moving in a super fast movement, and the dialogue is terrible. The performance is not very good either, and Wayne's character is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, looks like wooden puppets that are being directed by someone (in this case, it's by director Harry Fraser) . Harry Fraser is in the lead and does a good job, but the story is very thin. One can not help but feel that it's about ten minutes from the start of the film, since Randy has just arrived in the room and is looking to meet someone. An explanation of why Randy was there is to give later, which turns out to be something like it's a P.I that was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the city. To be honest, I really did not understand it, most of the time I expected the movie to end. <br /> <br /> But with that said, I did not find this movie to be completely terrible. I enjoyed it a little and I found it quite fun at times. But it really is not a great movie, and it really is not worth watching or tracking it. <br /> <br /> In general, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly outdated and is an annoying Western with very few redeeming qualities. It can be fun, but in general it's not a great movie and it's certainly one of Wayne's weakest starts.
