Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari was not present in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? To access Buddy. Why are you staying with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are many things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But is Kevin Spacey an excellent verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and totally credible because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Is Frank Whaley's kid certainly out of his element working for Buddy? He wants to write and make films with meaning, not to be a Gofer who is verbally abused to get Equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful films, seems to be out of Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The ending leaves a lot to be desired.
