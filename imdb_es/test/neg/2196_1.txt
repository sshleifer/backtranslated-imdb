[As a new resolution for this year 2005, I decide to write a comment for each movie I saw in theater (10%) or on DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I must admit that the DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the real voice of the cast, which is an essential feature of the personality. In my country, non-French films are dubbed and we end up with aberrations: the French voice is terrible, far from its original tone! the same voice for different people or the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And well, if all the comments did not work for me, well, in 2006, I will stop reviewing ... Ah, AH ... So enjoy them now! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that the story, the locations, the cast are not very nice ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra Bullock is there ... She is a talented actress, capable of making the viewer get hooked on the movie ... <br /> <br /> Remind a female "the fugitive" ... So if you are looking for a At the moment of escaping from your life, seeing this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess ... <br /> <br /> She has nothing more to cling to, only her poor mother (Who is the sick person? of Alzheimer's - the touch for depression) ... <br /> <br /> In fact, she has a sad life at the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life in everything, to finally return to her at the end .. .. what a happy ending! <br /> <br /> maybe the writers wanted to make a point about the life of a nerd ... <br /> <br /> very far from the best computer movie of all time: * WARGAMES *
