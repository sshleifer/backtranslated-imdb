Absolutely absolutely I can not believe my fellow IMDb critics. All the praise about how "original" this film is, it's as if they had never seen "Ring" or the million imitations that came out in the 10 years since that movie. And some of them claim to be fans of the horror movie! I do not think so! "Shutter" is fine. Average, I would say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there's simply no way it's original and great and "the most terrifying thing I've seen," as one reviewer put it. Puh-leeeze, people. This is simple. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear, if I see another ghost movie where the hero traces the ghost's past to discover why he is so angry and after them, I will scream. <br /> <br /> "Original"? Give me a break. You need to go out more. Or at least stop calling themselves "fanatics of the horror movie".
