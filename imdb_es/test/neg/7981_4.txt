I was recently in a theatrical version of this work. And, on the last day of the race, I was excited to see that I was going to be playing on television. I put a tape because it was on late at night and I saw it the next day. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The actors in the film made some of the discoveries that are in the script. That is understandable since the rescission process is probably different, but it was annoying to see it. Much of the original script was changed for the film to improve the screen, but I'm not sure it helped the movie. I gave this 4 stars just because I know that the script and the writing is much better than what this film portrays.
