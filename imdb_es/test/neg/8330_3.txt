Well, this was my first IMAX experience, so I was very impressed about it, mainly; although, in retrospect, I can not help but wish it had been another movie (less monochromatic). <br /> <br /> Magnificent Desolation to a large extent the "Program for Schools" felt the same way it lists all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading the National Geographic magazine in 3D. Strangely, it actually had a two-dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded and felt like it was a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the movie when an inadvertent abyss opens up; Apparently in his opinion, that was a bit WOW, but to be honest, it may have had more to do with being an IMAX virgin. <br /> <br /> The comment, provided by Tom Hanks, personally found very, (what is a good way to say it?) "nationalist waving flag" that did not work too well in central London, Judging from the comments heard when we left. <br /> <br /> Above all, I loved the IMAX experience, but I would very much like there to be a different movie that day. The Moon is not a particularly colorful subject and, to be honest, many of the 3D effects were lost in the monochromatic setting. Everything would have been fine, if not for the documentary insertions and the distractions like the interviews with American school children that spoiled it a bit.
