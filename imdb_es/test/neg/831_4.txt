First of all, let me say that I wasted movie night watching this garbage. Secondly, let me inform you that the current DVD available by Shriek Show is not uncut, so gore dogs will be very upset. Third, that scene is the highlight of the movie and, as it has been cut, well, you see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know that many terror fans are looking for this movie. It is atmospheric, shot in the forest with a very beautiful landscape, waterfalls and such. But after the opening massacre, which has a very brutal shot of a machete trapped through the crotch of a hunter, after that no brutal deaths are obtained. And, with a slasher movie, you somehow want that. At least, I do it. The director and co. Do not do anything new with the idea of ​​the killer in the forest, several of these types of movies were made at the same time in the early eighties. The only thing that has this is that you do not hate the actors as much as you would in other movies. They are kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them owns a deed of some property on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has properties there. There is no cabin or house, so why buy property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or whatever? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping, but that seems unusual. Anyway, two inbreds run over and start to stalk the campers and pick them up one by one. And, as I said before, at first you get practically nothing of decent deaths after death with a machete. The end has a kind of killing off the wall by Connie, but even that is not enough to prevent this is almost the same as the film completely forgettable, The Forest, which is amazing. <br /> <br /> If Shriek Show had been able to get a real impression without cuts, then this review might have been a little more forgiving, but this is the day and age of the DVD editions without cuts / unclassified. old and unknown films for filmmakers like me. When you criticize us, you receive the crude review. Unfortunately, the presence of the great paternal George Kennedy is the only highlight of this film that distinguishes it from the other variety of vegetables that occurred in the past.
