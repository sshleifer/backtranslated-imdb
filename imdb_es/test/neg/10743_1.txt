I enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I found this pile of children's dung. <br /> <br /> This piece of anti-Bush propaganda disguised as a horror movie is presented as an episode of the original Batman by Michael Moore. Political satire should be intelligent, however, this brings out a ten on the simple scale with all the style and credibility of a film by L. Ron Hubbard. stealing elections, going to war for no reason, and treating men and women as mere cannons. It even takes a hit in the Second Amendment and religion. All that was missing was CÃ©sar Romero when the president laughed how he orchestrated September 11. <br /> <br /> I guess the end was supposed to be the time to "support our troops", but I think I would be more offended than pleased with all the effort. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their mansions Malbu patting themselves on the back for this "concise" work while the misinformed against the war The drones greet him as a genius. <br /> <br /> It's time to equip yourself with new aluminum foil hats for kids.
