I will not vote this movie as a horrible one, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days when I felt so depressed to do anything and decided to rent a movie in the stupid videostore section. Also, I did not sleep one night and the movie woke me up ... Let's start the autopsy, it's fine, the movie has a strange argument, first is the isolation, there is an expedition, they are isolated on an island Because there is no gas on the boat, something like that, there is not a single convincing performance on the part of the actors (so far), the main problem starts after the idea of ​​isolation, the point of view of one snake, then another ... then another, then snakes that change, then false ghosts, many of them, and when we believe that the film is on track to make a suspense movie, the suspense fails, because after ten or eleven ghosts we do not let ourselves be carried away, the only scene that confuses everything is the scene in which we witness a drunken lesbian spectacle seen by snakes that seem to dance, after this is becoming not an adventure of horror but in a film based on comedy, the p Art of adventure is also discarded. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem in a movie is the third act, it is the only section that only leads the film to a conclusion already guessed, or if it succeeds we did not notice it, like a ninja smoke in our eyes, well ... The island of snakes has a bad conclusion, everything comes to a "by the book" Finishing, with a sequence of confrontation, persecution and escape, was predictable at the time I rented the copy of the dam. The other real problem is the concept, the concept is very important, it is the reason why you think that dinosaurs come to life or a corpse full of points that they just want to live, the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades of be tortured by humans. civilization, well ... hmmm, it just does not stick on the wall. One thing you will enjoy (if you look at it with an open mind) are the most bz sequences, the naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera angles, the braindead's homage to the lawn mower, the black does not die first, and that's all. ... if you want to see snakes, black guys and comedies and prefer higher budgets go see "snakes on a plane". <br /> <br /> Even the spectators
