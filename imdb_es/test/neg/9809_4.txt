Pretty twisted horror movie, it has some good moments here and there, with some spooky blood transfusion scenes, however, it's too boring for its own sake. All the characters are fine, and the story, although it has great potential, is quite boring, however, the blood transfusion scenes seemed terribly real and, as a result, they were extremely disturbing. It's well done and decently written, and it started really interesting, but it just could not keep up, plus, I found that the ending was disappointing. Linnea Quigley has only a very small role in this, so I was also disappointed, and Stephen Knight does a good job as a leader, as he was quite twisted, plus I got this on a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a lot of other horror movies. There is a lot of blood, however, it is not so bloody, and because of its low budget it was quite well made, however, as I said, I simply could not sustain its interest. This is a pretty twisted horror movie, it has some good moments here and there, with some spooky blood transfusion scenes, however, it's too boring for its own sake, it would happen, but I think it's worth seeing if you do not have nothing. better to do The address is fine. Elly Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane do a good job here with a good job with the camera and doing a good job with their low budget, however, the pace is too inconsistent for my taste. Acting is actually fine. Stephen Knight is excellent as a leader, he was creepy, twisted, sick and gave a very scary performance, although the most spooky of all was that he seemed a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is fine, I guess he sinned little time. The rest of the cast is also good. In general, I would approve, but I think it's worth looking if you have nothing better to do. * 1/2 of 5
