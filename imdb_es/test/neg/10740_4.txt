Homecoming; What a disappointment! After reading the summary of the plot (the dead vote again - AGAINST George W. Bush !!!!!) I could not wait to see this. It started interesting and immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, however, he slowly descended into a boring political satire that he did not need to see (I can only see a good Australian comedy for that!). There were practically only one or two scenes of horror and they were not even so terrifying. I could not believe that this came from Joe Dante, who could easily have achieved it with the same balance of emotions and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode so far. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
