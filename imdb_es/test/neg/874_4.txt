Is not it exactly a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually, the script "could" have worked if the lead roles had been played by younger actors, but the drama of an aged Diane Lane acting as if she were a teenager (or even a 20-year-old) was too hard to understand. Every time she (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere's arms and then lifted both heels behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on her face when he was probably thinking, "Oh, my back pain ... this Anyway, both characters were clearly unpleasant, especially Richard Gere's: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was in some kind of "soul search" after of a failed operation that left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and her son she had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet that angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets Adrienne. She recently separated from her unfaithful husband (surprise) and is helping a friend by watching the rent of her beach front house. Of course, that's where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling in love (especially when she discovers that he's a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). Between the romantic interludes and a nauseating dance / song routine that Lane (Adrienne) plays while listening to an old LP (no CD?), They both try to imagine how their lives were totally ruined. Dr. Flanner was not very father either and has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while growing up. (Naturally, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at that time instead of raising an impetuous and distracted child). To summarize a long (predictable) story, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner confront his inner demons, as well as confront angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going through a "routine" eradication). of cysts on the face). Dr. Flanner FINALLY is able to tell the husband (played with unbearable sympathy by Scott Glenn) who regrets what happened, although it was all the fault of that anesthesiologist. "I told her I was too old for so much juice!" The character of Glenn, (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It is difficult to say because his emotional response is so passive at this moment that he wonders if he is listening to the good Dr. or if he is thinking of an area that he needs to plow. Increasingly circumspect, Dr. Flanner decides that he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing pro bono medicine in a third world country) to repair their relationship. Unfortunately, that means you must temporarily say goodbye to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, she writes a love letter every hour at the time of Adrienne (who almost faints like a school girl every time she has one) and tells her that the hardest thing she had What to do was say goodbye Obviously, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife was the second most difficult thing. In the end, he is killed in a strange mudslide (poetic justice like in a mud?) And she is left with only the memories of what could have been ... let's hope there are no more sequels of Gere / Lane !
