I saw and I have the black and white original of 1959, starring Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins, and no matter how many times I see it, I can not help but not cry. ) a set, like the one of 1959, but there were so many errors in the design. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist in that period of time existed in the movie. Doris Roberts, sad to say that she CAN NOT play a drama, is a comical actress and that will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel looked like a university professor of mine instead of the dentist who was supposed to play. In the original film, Anne walked the "glove" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take more than a minute. In this fucking remake, it took less than 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct ... This remake is just that, a remake. What did the director think when choosing funny actors in a dramatic role like that? I'm sorry but James Coco can not do drama. Max .. Schell was better at Deep Impact than this movie. The bad-tempered Mrs. Frank was just that bad mood, I could not stand it. Referring and comparing with the 1959 version, I like it better, did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Of 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Do not waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
