I bought this e-bay movie as part of a score of horror movies, all for one dollar a piece. Seeing this, my first impression was that it was probably the late '80s. Later I started thinking: the Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to suggest that I was dealing with a more recent movie. Realizing that, the movie became an unbearable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in the history of the film: the film refused to finish. Is there a genre like "horror for children"? In that case, this movie is without a doubt. If there are parents, perverse enough to want to present their descendants to horror, I suggest that this would be perfect for children around 6-8. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic and deep part of a double bill.
