If you and your friends find so much humor and fun in horrible acting, jokes, accessories and creating movies in general like me and my friends, you should rent this. <br /> <br /> Simply by reading the label line and seeing how much fun it is, you must assume that it is not more fun, low quality, excellent and hilarious content. It is a story of some of the children who defy all the laws of physics and reality and fly through time through a modern big-screen TV to a world of dinosaurs that eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilariously serious scene in which T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> I should be in the comedy section but you will find it with children's movies if you find it. So call your friends, sit down, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote the phrases in a ridiculously horrible way in this movie for weeks. "What's up with all the fuss ?!"
