The premise of the film was very promising: a kind of Napoleon Dynamite gay movie. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but in reality it was not very good in general. The script and the dialogue felt like a local sketching production, full of clich√©s and predictable scenes. <br /> <br /> However, there was enough that it was fun, that I stayed to see how it ended, as it had hinted that something special happens at the end. But it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt, almost jumping directly from what appeared to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits. <br /> <br /> In general, it was very disappointing, but not completely unappealable ...
