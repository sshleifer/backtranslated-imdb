If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, BE CAREFUL! The cover has Tori Wells and three other porn stars "80's", and has a copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not), you'll think "80's porn? Tori Wells? ! " Cunning!! It was made in 1974 and has nicknamed German stars! There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the German porn of the 70s, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover makes you think you're getting. Once I overcame my fury for the brazen and deceptive jacket, I saw it anyway. It's a bad movie, bad. I'm sorry, I guess I did not get over my anger.
