I really tried, but this movie just did not work for me. The action scenes were boring, the acting was surprisingly poor and some of these characters were stereotyped to be even fun. Pam Grier tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent can not avoid a disaster. Even by the standards of this weak genre, this movie is pretty bad.
