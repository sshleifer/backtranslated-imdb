This is a true stench. <br /> <br /> The story is not on par with most other episodes of TZ. It's pretty boring, but seeing Peter Falk as a look of Fidel Castro is fun. <br /> <br /> Each time Twilight Zone would air at an unannounced time in my hometown, I would take a sandwich and a drink and settle for quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it ended up being THIS episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another TZ fan like me) too. There were so many times that one of us said to the other: "I was ready to see" The Twilight Zone "and guess what episode I was in. The episode of the Cuban Dictator!" Obviously, some people like this episode, since they get a rating of 6.7 ... how it happened, I have no idea, but THAT in itself would be a great plot of the Twilight Zone!
