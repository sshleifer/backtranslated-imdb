Ron Hall makes a triple threat while he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your police clich√© on a mission that is up to his neck in a nasty vampire action. Throwing your plate, look for the last vampire killer (not Buffy!) To recover the streets and defeat the bloodsuckers back to the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible movie. It breaks so many other movies (can you say Blade?) That it does not even try to establish its own identity. The script does not exist The action is horrible. Who says that a micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing even remotely interesting here. You will not get any of this except a headache. Stay away at all costs.
