My mother, my cousins ​​and I are big fans of Jane Austen. We know all the words of Pride and Prejudice's 1995 masterpiece, and we've seen Emma by Gwyneth Paltrow a shameful number of times. I have read all the books, and I have even sat several times in Sense, sensitivity and persuasion. So my mother and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or Nancy Drew's 1939 film that I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my "worst movies" before). The first thing that happens, as you can see in the opening scene, is that the "heroine", Catherine, has a frightening and strange imagination, inspired by poor quality novels that a heroine of Jane Austen would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which a horrible man with a greasy wig takes her, dragged across a field in the direction of God knows everything and, suddenly, is rescued by A handsome man on a white horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing that any movie viewer will notice instantly is the high-pitched sound and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. Here there is no classical music or English dances! It is also evident, almost at first glance, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely wrong. In the first place, it is quite unattractive, and is further affected by its non-Austen behavior. His looks and movements are rare! In addition, they are completely affected and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills affects almost every actor in the film. Even Mr. Tilney, the so-called "pretender young suitor" is not decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in the costumes by the filmmakers is evident. Huge headdresses in the style of Marie Antoinette clash with Empire style dresses (for the most part) in the right style. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is dressed in black as a sort of ancient Gothic nightmare: she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance becomes even more foolish for a huge mark of crescent beauty on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all women wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that kept my mother and me howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the "bathroom". The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing together in a large bathhouse, probably not very likely at the beginning of the 19th century, and then we saw that all the women seemed to be carrying large porcelain or plastic plates. around their necks with ropes, the plates floated horizontally in the water, containing some mysterious pieces of ... something, we assumed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, and finally, when the mysterious substance began to disappear between the shots, we deduced that It was food, but I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey, my warning to anyone considering renting this movie: stay in your hand And if someone is considering BUYING IT, well, I do not even know what to say about it. <br /> <br /> You'd think that when the actors and other people who make this movie got around 1/4 of On the way, they would realize the monster they were creating and they would stop. Unfortunately, they did not, and Northanger Abbey was left in the world.
