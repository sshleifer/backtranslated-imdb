I chose this movie because it sounded like a pretty decent movie, and I've always been a fan of foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate and hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Although it aims to expose the lives of young, lower-class men in Lima, and to the extent that it is successful, the characters are irremediably shallow and the audience ends up with absolutely no feeling for them. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves mainly around M, he rarely speaks, and his dialogue is, at best, incredibly dry and dull. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: Some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around a young man named M who has been looking for jobs, but without success (He he wins a job twice, but quits because they are not for him, when you are poor, the last option you have is to be demanding). Spend a little time with your friends, whose idea of ​​"fun" is to rape a 14-year-old boy, steal shitty tires from a piece of shitty car for a sack of ten-cent grass, and several other slightly delayed activities . /> <br /> M's friend comes with a plan to earn $ 25,000 per piece and move to the United States bringing Cocaine to Miami. When the drug dealer gives them a job, they invite us to a very scarce scene of three friends who buy clothes in the mall with some background music. We see them trying on different clothes like the girls who receive $ 200 to buy, cut their hair and then look like gangsters (a character, Carlos, from now on he will wear sunglasses ALWAYS ... even at night). The day before they leave, the group leader goes to talk to the drug lord, leaving M and his friend to be fools. They party, take several samples of the drugs that are supposed to run and enter the old school, acting like animals and destroying everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when M tries to call his girlfriend. , that hangs. The friends then proceed to set fire to the public telephone, which highlights a group of children and an old man with a gun. M and Carlos's friend in charge of the drug race appear on his motorcycle and want them to leave with him now. Then he goes alone and gets shot by that old man. The police appears and arrests M and his friends (but not the man who shot him) and covers his dead friend with newspapers while the music plays and fades into credits. <br /> <br /> **** End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even saw this movie for the second time, hoping to see some subtle and redemptive factor for it, but not what I did. A total waste of 102 minutes. Although I must give credit for being simple and not avoid the disturbing elements, the casting, acting and general direction still leave much, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion interested in a film that explores the issues that I was supposed to do, go to rent City of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this garbage at all costs! You have been warned !!
