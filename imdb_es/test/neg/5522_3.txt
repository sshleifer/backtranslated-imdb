"Happy Days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-70s to the early 80s and seems to become more ridiculous with age. At the time of its release, most of the viewers who grew up in the 1950s were in middle age with families, and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought them an artificial nostalgia. The Fonz was, of course, the best of the geniuses (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned to drive a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was a totally American blond boy who would probably be elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend: the star of the show has to have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was the Fonz's clumsy companion, if not the whole group. I loved it when the Fonz hit poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged guy who ran Mel's Diner. And of course, who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was this really the 1950s? Ironically, films produced during the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" have improved with age and portray the period more honestly than this program that occurred 20 years after the period portrayed . <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same category as "Rebel Without A Cause" or "American Graffitti". The "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950s with its burgers, food boxes, cool cars and sticky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism made strictly for laughs than for an honest portrait. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed more about what the middle-aged people of the 1970s wished it were the 1950s. The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the fifties. "Happy Days" is, in the best of cases, a fantasy comedy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950s as a backdrop. As another critic pointed out, American child Richie Cunningham would probably have been reprimanded for befriending a person who leaves school as Fonzie. And Mel would probably prohibit Fonzie from entering his Diner. <br /> <br /> A short story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" which was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots who had themes related to sex and romance that were not transmitted to the pilot sometimes appeared on the "Love American Style" show, which aired infrequently instead of baseball games that had rained or other cancellations unexpected programming and / or alterations. In short, "Love American Style" was a presentation program that contained all these comedy pilots of an episode that never made it to a slot machine premiere. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show sometime in the early 1970s, but at that time television executives could not foresee how a program about young people of the 1950s would be popular, especially during the heyday of comedy shows centered around middle-aged people, such as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and its subsequent side effects like "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show" and "All in the Family " (How things have changed since now, most television comedies are about young people and the industry avoids most programs about middle-aged people like the plague!) <br /> <br /> Later, one of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a child actor from "The Andy Griffith Show" called Ron Howard, had the opportunity to star in a film about young people that took place in 1959 called "American Graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas, whose previous "THX 1138" had bombed miserably at the box office. Even when it was released by film executives, again the studios could not see how a film about young people in the 1950s could become popular because it did not "fit" with what had been popular in the past, although they did not realize it. that much of the cinema audience had been young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film was a great success, and studio executives acknowledged that they had misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical career of "American Graffitti", TV executives realized they had a pilot comedy in their vault that looked a lot like "American Graffitti". They recovered it with the original cast, in addition to Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz", they re-titled "Happy Days" and the rest is television history, since it became one of the most popular programs of the 1970s . <br /> <br /> "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, they are never more or less than they are superficially. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem preposterous and even silly. Today, Fonz's character seems to be a caricature of The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of the character of Marlon Brando in "The Wild One"? Looking at the program with new eyes, I feel that the producers really missed the great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that could still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers decided to laugh for little money. This is definitely a show that has not stood the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many of the external appearances of "Happy Days" but had an advantage. He had an honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffitti", but could not take his heart.
