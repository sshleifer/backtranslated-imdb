Until now I did not like every single Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and that always bothered me because it's an acclaimed Euro-junk monument and extremely popular with many regular users on this lovely website; People whose opinions I always value and usually agree. Apparently, everyone always seems to point out some kind of grim and stylistic filming marks in their work that are completely lost on me. Rollin's films are unimaginably boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various configurations), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the wonderful Gothic configuration is always underutilized and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a ticket. bus. In fact, I had already left Rollin's repertoire (especially after enduring "The Iron Rose"), until I discovered "Night of the Hunted." Apparently, this film does not present any lame lesbian vampire and is presented as a real horror movie with gruesome murders and macabre plot twists. And the verdict is ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undoubtedly the most convincing and inventive Rollin film that I had the pleasure of seeing so far (and also the only one I have seen without falling asleep). On the other hand, it is still a stupid movie with a meaningless plot and sex sequences without emotions to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin tries intensely to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mainly due to a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but he barely manages to hide the fact that he does not really have a story to tell. The beautiful main actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautiful and ominous musical guide are the only elements that keep him hooked on the screen. During a night trip back home in Paris, a young man has to stop abruptly for a confused and barely dressed girl who comes running from the forest. Her name is Elisabeth but, in addition, she can not remember anything about herself and what or from whom she fled. His case of amnesia is so bad that he even forgets continuously who picked it up. The next day, she was kidnapped again by an older man and taken to a sinister apartment complex where several people in the same strange mental state are captive. Elisabeth does not know anything, but she has the feeling that she needs to escape from here. Obviously I will not reveal the outcome, but I can assure you that it is quite silly, illogical and exaggerated. Apparently, Rollin realized this too, because the explanation is very brief and quick. There are a lot of too weird and foolish sequences, the images of sex are terrible and they are recorded without passion, the unpleasant effects of makeup seem cheap and are thrown at random without a real purpose. As it was said, the score is fascinating and the perfect body of Brigitte Lahaie is addictive to glaze.
