The Second Woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to hurt him. A girl who likes to help, but is made to believe that their fears are caused by a mental illness ... <br /> <br /> Interesting plot, very good performance, but the overall result is poor in many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather, it is presented in a simplistic way (although there are a couple of interesting twists in the plot). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I do not want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie. "Come on, it was the fifties!", You can think. However, I have seen quite a few films from that era and I know that some do not seem so outdated nowadays. <br /> <br /> Something that bothered me was that some scenes shot to the end, so it's almost impossible. To see what was happening. Ok, it is a black cinema, but this is too black in some points ...: o) <br /> <br /> In general, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but it is not garbage either. Look at it if you have nothing else to do ...
