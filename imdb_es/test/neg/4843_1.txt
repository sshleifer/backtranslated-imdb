Sure, you can see some boobies, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you get more mileage from YouTube. I just paid a redbox dollar because I saw the name of Val Kilmer. Bad move. The plot did not get thicker, the dialogue was of poor quality, the characters did not develop in the best of cases. Someone said that the cinematography was fine, but do not expect too much. This movie moved very slowly and ended without grace. Blacklist. I spent a lot of the movie wondering if any event or color scheme of things was symbolic. Actually I never rewound to find out because in the end nothing was ever explained. There are no turns. He also left many questions that, as a result, he had no desire to hear an answer. One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
