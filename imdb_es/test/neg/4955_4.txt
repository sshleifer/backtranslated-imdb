If there's something I've learned from watching George Romero's Creepshow, it's that if you run into an old and mysterious box that someone has obviously made a great effort to hide, just leave it alone: ​​there's probably something unpleasant inside. <Br /> <br /> Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, the character of Robert Englund in 'Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer' is not a Romero fan, because he breaks the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard, just to discover? "Surprise, surprise", an ancient demon that possesses his body (initially caused him to eat and vomit a lot). <br /> <br /> When the demon finally leaves Crowley's body during chemistry class and begins to transform the students into hellish and heartbreaking beasts, it's up to the plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try to stop the disgusting creatures , armed only with a tube and fed by a lifelong hatred for all monstrous things! <br /> <br /> The DVD package for Jon Knautz's low-budget monster movie promises The Hell of a Fun Journey, which offers emotions and spills like one would expect from its average creature characteristic of 80 (bugs with teeth, suits of rubber monsters, horrible blood, and absolutely nothing of CGI!) And during the last 15 minutes, that is exactly what the spectators obtain: effects of non-stop interpolation; silly Jabba-style demonic nonsense with tentacles; and a lot of macho monster! <br /> <br /> It's a shame, then, that the rest of the film's execution time (about 70 minutes or so) is mainly spent following Jack as he goes about his boring, everyday business: plumbing, visiting his psychiatrist, attending chemistry classes and bothering his girlfriend. If you think you could enjoy a movie that focuses primarily on dealing with trauma and anger management during childhood, buying spare boiler valves at a hardware store and the chemical properties of sodium, this is the movie for you; but if what you are looking for is a massive dose of monster chaos, I advise you to look elsewhere!
