"The Ballad of the Sad Café" worked hard with his image, but when the time came for the crisis, he stayed in his own dust created by himself. <br /> <br /> One can not imagine saying this noisy, but if Amelia of Vanessa Redgrave fought with John Wayne or even with Clint Eastwood, my earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. His interpretation of Amelia was so close to perfection and consumed with a more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to anyone hired for several million dollars. Redgrave gave Amelia this moving accent that was a mixture of her own unique voice and a woman won with so much effort from the south. For the average viewer, this could be interpreted as annoying, but as the movie progressed, it became her. Miss Amelia transforms this scenic beauty into a bully. It was Redgrave's performance, as well as his interaction with the other characters, which made this film stand firm. but not the highest one. The others who followed his performance were necessary, but not stellar. When we passed the cloudy cliché image transmitted by each stage designer hired for the post-Southern Depression work, the secondary characters felt like posterboards. The image was necessary to set the scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of an old wild speech preacher. Only its scenes will make any viewer question the validity of this city out of the ordinary. The two main players that surrounded Amelia fought with charm for the admirable moment of theft of scenes, but due to the lack of direction. It just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (although both of high rank among the line of questionable sanity) is Cork Hubbard, who plays the "cousin" of Amelia that appears at random one night. His character is never completely defined, he lacks true motivation and his loyalties remain uncertain. It does not play a vital role in this film other than forcing viewers to question their sanity and honesty. Can you create a character by simply sticking out your tongue, moving your ears and hitting your chest and head? Finally, there is the other extreme of the absurd. Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tormented man build character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to weaken. These were the characters, as cliché of the south as they were? some went ahead and tried to create an absurd piece of time, and I can not argue that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" did not rise above mediocrity was in cinematography and narrative. This movie was about Amelia, and her need for other souls in her life. Was the comfort level of the public with the arrival of their dwarf cousin entertained? one could not help but wonder if he was honest or just a trustworthy man trying to steal a warm heart. The character of Cork Hubbard is never fully understood, but we accept it with brief shots of him and Amelia doing little things together. It is his idea that transforms from a lone businesswoman to a coffee owner in good faith. The problem is that director Callow never takes us to that dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave. Is the man crazy or does he represent Amelia's entire family? I needed something from Callow to get these two out of the David Lynch-esquire relationship they had. Then our pool deepens further with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's "love interest". Using the technique of a flashback inside a flashback, we see the two married, but never consummate their love? that Amelia's anger against his love led him to the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was this even in the movie? With the lack of focus towards the connection of these characters, the final scenes between the two did not make sense. Throw in the choice of Cork and it simply breaks down completely. While there were some beautiful choreographic scenes that Callow created, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest and my care for the characters collapsed when I did not understand the final question. "why"? <br /> <br /> In general, "The Ballad of the Sad Café" started with a bang, but ended with a small crack of firecrackers. My emotional feeling of this movie moved up and down, up and down, and finally I stayed lower, mainly due to the lack of understanding of the characters' motives. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and while the other characters (out of chance Steiger) did their best, I just did not understand who they were. Their motives were so confusing that when the emotional end finally occurred, I was apathetic. Director Callow seemed to have lacked important connection scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our main actors. Callow created some beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap the stage, which allowed us to focus on Amelia. or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The film developed with anger, discovery, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, disappearing. Without the comparative connectors, this was transformed from a distinguished period film into actors playing parts in front of the camera. It was a shame, because "Sad Café" had the promise, it simply could not fulfill. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ½ of *****
