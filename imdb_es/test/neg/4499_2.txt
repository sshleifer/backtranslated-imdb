More of a Frisbee like turtle with fangs that rise like a pig wart. More battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits. A space ball of ping pong. Two naughty children who know how to do everything, even get on board the spaceship. More boring music More "Gamera is the friend of the children". I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were very funny because the monsters were actually a threat to people. Now they are just a parade of costumes with very little behind them. Adults are all ridiculous and foolish. As in American comedies, children are the bosses (when in reality they could not get out of a paper bag). These monster movies must be the Japanese means of partonizing these little snots. However, above all, after watching three of these films (with the same plot over and over again, check the archive images), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you have not seen it, do not bother.
