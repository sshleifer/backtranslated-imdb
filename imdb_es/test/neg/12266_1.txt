5 minutes into the movie, the first fight scene I was watching, I could only help, but due to the lack of tension in the scene, the cameras that cross from one side to the other really show that I had no idea what I was doing, well, actually, the soundtrack that the best thing is not a low budget movie and you will not get the 40 best songs, but at least you will get music that goes with the scene that is not that difficult to interpret, well , if I saw it, I will gladly let you know. the script was so badly written that now I would be surprised by a part of the guy who wrote wrote this piece of beep, I will give the person a 10/10 and that was for the cover of the DVD because if I really saw "before seeing this" in I bought one and it was like 10 15 dollars I would have bought it, why? If you look at the cover, it is very well made, you turn to the back and see that it has really won awards. now it's a very deceptive thing because even in a small film festival I would never believe in my life that this would win anything, all I can say is "wow, if this were the best, I would not want to know what the hell at the film festival it was like "<br /> <br /> the movies that are so bad only have a good use and that is for an aspiring film director to use them as inspiration. Films like this are better tools than good movies, because with a good movie that you almost know right away, it's very likely that you do not make a movie as good, but if you use a movie like this, you can see all the things that the director did wrong or the writer so you do not make the same mistakes, and you have the additional advantage of watching this movie and saying that if you can produce a beep like this, then there is hope that there is someone out there.
