Implacable as one of those noisy action movies. The whole cast seems to be in speed. I did not understand the director's intentions, if any. I wonder if he has ever seen Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a musical by George Sidney. Structure, please! This is a hell of a disaster and I loved Abba. The costumes are unflattering photography, unflattering for the actors, but loved towards the places. The only thing that makes everything bearable is the vision of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. Without chemistry with your friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman movie and you will understand what I was waiting for. I was particularly embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it, so it's probably just me.
