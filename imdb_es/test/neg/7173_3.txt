You have to be a fan of the little man, but Burlesque in Carmen is boring, unimaginative and not very funny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin retells Carmen's story and plays a great role as Don Jos√©. It is a story about the men and women they love, although it is not clear why one would love a woman like Carmen, as she is pitting men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said, I did not think much of that. Chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious about the difference between this film and the 1915 version ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> In general: 3/10.
