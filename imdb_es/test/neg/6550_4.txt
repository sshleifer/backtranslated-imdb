This movie is about people who live in a trailer park. Later in the film it becomes clear that these people are jobless comedians, mainly old men. Well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about fucking. But there is never any action, just those people talking. At first, I thought it was a perverse, perverted bum thing, but after a while it got boring. I mean, how many versions can you think of saying fuck, d ** k & c ** t? Of course, this can be fun: maybe for half an hour, not 80 minutes. But it was fun to see those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure they were often reading their text on some sheet when they played. But it does not bother the movie, it's great that way. because those individuals seem so poor, fucked up, ruined, that the style fits completely. his reading of the texts, defenseless and wooden, creates a pretty good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** later in the film The f *** ers do some comedies (rhymes about fucking) with themselves as a public and as imaginary applause. then one receives an eviction council and, therefore, they decide to defend the RV park and enter its roofs, armed with some weapons. then they managed to shoot. fin. It sounds like an action, but it is not. Only some house-camera trash takes. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the film is totally consistent in its style and I'm pretty sure that is exactly what the filmmaker wanted to have. It's the portrait of those f ** k-ups in a stunned camera style with characters who can not act but look like interesting personalities, so they're nice to see. but the texts on - you know what - all the time it gets boring after a while. <br /> <br /> fairly young director who also seems like an interesting person, since he played some adolescent in popular movies / TV series. But now I have more horror movies, which is more your cup of tea, I suppose. And this, your first address-effort will be distributed by troma now. I do not know anything about a release, I got this as an "advanced screener" of this year's cannes that says "only for smuggling purposes".
