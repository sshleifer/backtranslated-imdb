All I have to say is a word ... SUCKS !!!! The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he is great. I should have beaten the Klein boys in the ass ... stupid and brainless. At the end of this movie you can not stand Klein and you really do not care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about this.
