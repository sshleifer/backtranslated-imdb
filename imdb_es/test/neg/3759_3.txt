I fully understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that does not make it a good movie. For starters, the plot (or what there is of it) is boring and lifeless. Five astronauts take off for the moon? they deviate from the course and end up on Mars (eh?)? Do cave-looking Martians throw rocks at them? Do they return to Earth and find a fiery death? The end. Believe it or not, but this concise description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, John Emery's character, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, feels it is necessary to give long speeches about the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just a minute of emotion (aimed at sarcasm). <br /> <br /> Looking back at Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the representation of women fun if it were not so sad and wrong. I could cite a number of examples, but there is an exchange of dialogue just after the takeoff between the male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the irritant and plastic-haired Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female member of the crew). and the constant object of Floyd's often creepy attention) that nicely illustrates the attitudes of the film to women: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I've been wondering how it was that a girl like you got confused in something like this in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think that women should only cook, sew and have children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Is not that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!
