A mediocre horror movie that deals with dumb and not-so-horny teens who discover an evil video game (GASP) is killing those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the mystery held by Mystery Gang in "Scooby Doo". I was waiting for a mask to be removed from one of the villains. I could deal with this for 40 minutes, even as a science fiction movie, but going all the way to the theaters, people come. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is somewhat unpleasant, but the director Uwe Boll, since this would be his cast. As always, the best of video game systems is the glorious power button. I would suggest using that half vision. * 1/2
