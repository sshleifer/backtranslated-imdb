Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's that bad. Truly an unequal and unfair representation of "bad" versus "good" in the world of wine. Did you notice that the filmmaker tried some of the wines of the outstanding protectors of individual wines and terroirs? The work of the camera is, at best, dizzying, while the content can make you sleep in a short time. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this film was that the filmmaker was trying to demonstrate the globalism of wine by demonstrating, for example, that Mondavi's family wineries are everywhere in the world. It's okay, it's a good start. So, how do these wines compare? Do you know the Mondavi Napa taxi as its Italian wines? We never discovered it because nobody in the movie comments on this. Instead, there are many innuendoes about Nazi and fascism. Well, those things do not grow grapes. Hmmmm
