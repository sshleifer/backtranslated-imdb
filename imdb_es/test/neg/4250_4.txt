Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows, because it emphasizes the character's development and continuity, and presents a more complex background and continuous storylines. In a way, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the program fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a telenovela on a space station, with two full seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots on the characters. The characters are a good group, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers tried too hard to make them "normal." By "normal" they actually mean "ordinary and tedious". <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season, we are introduced to the Dominion, who walks threateningly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys. in the fifth season. This is the main "story arc" of the show, but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series. We still have lame and autonomous episodes, the heroes are still stranded on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there are a lot of low profile comedies in which Ferengi appears, the greedy and clumsy. Many episodes are simply boring and some can not be seen. <br /> <br /> The Dominion, the main villains of DS9, are inclined towards galactic domination for the convenient reason that, well, they just do not like anyone. The whole war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Stunning pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from Season Three onwards, but they are carried out in a ridiculously simplistic manner, like two huge fleets of super-advanced ships that fly among themselves and take off. The writers of DS9 (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later of the fame of "Battlestar Galactica") spiced up their monotonous spectacle when beginning a war, but deep down it is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 It's still a very frustrating experience. The story is still too flat and obvious to be really exciting, and the characters never really develop in an interesting way. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" fulfilled the promise made by DS9 and they did everything much better. For Star Trek, stay with the original and the next generation.
