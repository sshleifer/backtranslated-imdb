Anyone who watches this movie will realize that the manufacturers released a lot of money in this movie. It's interesting to be titled "El Hoyo"! Production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole tries to be seen with a big budget and does it somehow, but is hampered by the video format in which it was recorded. Speculate that if it was filmed in 35 mm, it would look amazing and raise the content a little. Many Hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of the story and the content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe the next Ishimoto movie will be released.
