The night before, I got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold', which I had once bought with many other cheap movies from a video store. It looked like a good old action movie, so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing night. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the best boy I have ever seen in my life. As a good person, you have to be nice, of course, but it's just a cunt! That does not quite fit a boxer who has 28 KO's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. Even good kids can be great. Well, then came his first fight while working for this pimp. Each hit was clearly omitted and that became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the hits. Then there's the totally useless performance of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave him a 1 because I had never seen such a bad movie.
