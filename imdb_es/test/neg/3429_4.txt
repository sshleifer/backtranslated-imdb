This film of World War II, set in Borneo, strives so hard to work on so many levels, it is a pity that it fails in all of them. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is an escaped American who witnesses the executions of His companions by the Japanese. It enters the jungles of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds the adopted tribe of Nolte. Nolte, who now looks like Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. He defeated an unconditional warrior in a bloody battle, and had a revealing tattoo on his chest (a dragon). Now, before leaving and getting a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things are not going well in Nolteland. Havers wants the help of the tribe to fight against the Japanese, who are invading the island. Teach the natives to use machine guns, and start a lot of shooting. As the tribe becomes more successful, they face a new squad of Japanese who are not like the others. This squad cannibalize the villages they conquer to maintain their strength (talk about your sushi), and move through the jungles even faster than the tribe. As we know the outcome of the war, in the end we know that the tribe triumphs, but with great casualties. Here come the spoilers: Havers is wounded and returned to "civilization". Give the location of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then takes the trouble to free Nolte, and the role of final credits. <br /> <br /> The direction of Milius is certainly adequate, but the script here is quite vague in its motivations. Present ideas of history, then leave them to get to the next idea of ​​history. Nolte is horrible when the soldier became king, desperately trying to channel the spirit of Colonel Kurtz of Marlon Brando. Talk about freedom, the beauty of the jungle and the richness of its people, and you will not believe for a second the words you say. It's often unintentionally funny, especially his initial bug in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the movie sounding like a hippie. Nigel Havers passes the movie looking at Nolte as if she were Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual current under the current goes beyond friendship, not sex, and is based on a tacit relationship that must have had the natives talking. <br /> <br /> Havers often stays on the sidelines and has an internal conflict, rejected in The head of the tribe hunted, but basking in Nolte's attention. Their British service partners with straight laces become natives faster than the Bounty landing group in Tahiti, but the only thing I saw about Borneo is that it is very humid and has a lot of green. <br /> <br /> Climate betrayal, where Havers gives away from Nolte's location, is completely devoid of any reason. There is not a single thought about why Havers does this, except for the movie to continue. He was angry, when by chance, Havers and Nolte end up in the same ship that goes to the Philippines, the ship runs aground, and Havers runs to the hold to free the newly fallen Nolte. There is no farewell kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king and explains the title. <br /> <br /> If you were fighting a war and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, would not that scare you? This Japanese elite squadron is not showing enough, although their eating habits are so horrible that I would become a conscientious objector immediately. The same kind of ghostly enemy was handled much better in "The 13th Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other types of interesting ideas are abandoned. What about the fact that modern technology causes the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte let the British use their subjects without too much hesitation? Why can not Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, "Goodbye to the king" is a disappointment, it is not anchored by a strong advantage, and it tries to be too much. Things without thinking and exploring your options. I can not recommend this. <br /> <br /> This movie is classified (PG13) by strong physical violence, violence by a strong firearm, some gore, some blasphemy, some sexual references and adult situations.
