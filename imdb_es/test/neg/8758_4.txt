Oh, the horror! I have seen MANY bloody movies in my day, but this one only makes me vomit with laughter instead of repulsion. This is definitely a crazy movie and it has a very low budget, I might add, but if you can look beyond the cheap audio, the horrible dialogue, the ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes and the overall appearance of the movie, then you can that you find something of this movie that is something entertaining. The story is about a cat killer who will kill every "fifth day, fifth month, fifth year" (wow, how original), and it depends on two detectives (one of whom made a brave effort) to try make the crapy dialogue good) to stop the bloody rampage of the killer. The killing scenes (which are made with a plastic toy knife) are quite brutal (which is good), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream (which is very penetrating). As for gore, there is enough but it seems very false; especially blood - friend, come on, purple blood? But, if you are a fan of gore videos, like me, then you will find something in this video that you will appreciate as I did (the detective who talks badly ... is the best for this movie). Other than that, all you're going to find is a bunch of nonsensical nudity (which is also a good thing, but it's a shame that the girls are OOOGLY) and a very stupid hippie necrophiliac serial killer. I'm sorry, but this one stinks.
