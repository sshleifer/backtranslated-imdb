Technically, this movie would have had it all: decent actors, a nice landscape, no obvious views of a budget shortage, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. the summary of the plot also sounded promising, suggesting a satire about silly bureaucracy and ordinary people who mocked her. <br /> <br /> however, it never fulfills. The plot is simply too illogical. Throughout the entire film, not a single person does a single sensible thing. Crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers, all rush from one incredible situation to the next. what everyone does never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, this type of film must be absurd and exaggerated. however, it is also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind dividing a city in the middle. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who seems to have no idea what is happening to him, and the "writer", who occasionally makes jokes from the beginning that could be considered amused by an audience formed only by children of 12 years. <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most is that the movie tries to be fun all the time, but it did not make me laugh once. I've seen several bad "funny" movies, but so far each and every one of them showed at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so, in this sense, "puckoon" is really extraordinary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, visit "Brazil". Do not waste your time on "puckoon".
