ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin off and not much more than the original cartoon of Nickalodeon RUGRATS who introduced the babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (the sister of Chuckies) and Dill (Tommy's brother). I grew up with RUGRATS and I thought it was a great caricature. He had excellent humor, good stories and the creators of the program, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. The new program ALL GROWN UP tries to recover the magic of the original caricature. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found Chuckie "adult" just annoying and all the "preadolescent-mature / trying to be popular" that applied to (unfortunately) * all * the bored and discolored characters. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole RUGRATS baby gang look ten years their age in the original show. In general, this program is "fair" and you can only see if a) you are a fan of RUGRATS, b) you have never seen the original program, c) you are a preteen who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that Somehow you are bound to see this show. This show is not so good. It does not compare to the older episodes of RUGRATS in quality, humor and everything else.
