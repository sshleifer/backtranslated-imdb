Why spend a moment in this awkward and self-conscious movie? From time to time, after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting, we began to obtain fragments of the great band that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians that they were. Occasionally, in an impromptu session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra playing "Marie" and, notably, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra leading Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes", we get a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD transfer is as bad as the acting. My copy has only four chapters. That means you can get arthritis in your fast moving finger and try to accelerate where good things are. The swamp you are moving through is the Hollywood version of the life and battles of the two Dorseys. Tommy, superb with the trombone, and Jimmy, superb with the saxophone, usually could not stand. In 1935 they finally split up, with Tommy forming his own orchestra. Each one had greater success only than what they had achieved together. They reconciled when their father died in the forties, which is where the film ends. Later they managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by Tommy when the era of the great band faded in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at age 51, vomiting while asleep after drinking alcohol, pills and a large meal. Jimmy died of cancer at age 53 in 1957. Jimmy was very talented and otherwise a reasonably quiet guy. Tommy had a great talent and, otherwise, often a dominant imbecile. But good music makes up for many flaws, and the Big Band sounds that both created helped define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the film, and we see them develop from wrestlers (with child actors) to adult men who fight and scream at each other. The film is full of not only his two parents, played by the Irish clich√©s of Hollywood, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who only want their children to get along with each other, but also with an important sub-story that involves a romance between Janet Blair, as a childhood friend of the Dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a mediator and facilitator almost full time, and William Lundigan, as a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why he never became the star he probably should have become, just look at the movies, like this one, in which his studio put it. No wonder he left Hollywood. Lundigan simply occupies space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, aside from when we can really listen to Dorsey's work? Well, here is a song written especially for the film and given to Blair to work. It's called "For me." <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of a rosary ... the rise of a sea that rises ... the radiance of a star ... <br /> <br /> The rose of a rosary? The movie can not be better than this, and it can not get worse. Still, if you like the Dorseys and if the price is right ... well, in retrospect, I still would not buy it. The highlight, for me, is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them for free on You Tube. You will also find a little of each of the Dorsey. I wish I had known.
