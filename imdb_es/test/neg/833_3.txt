This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on television for too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes start repeating again and again. OK, from the beginning, the first series were pretty good. You had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel) being chased by his assistant played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wanted to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic who hated Punch and Judy children, a dubbed jockey and a comedian. As stated earlier, it started well, but it lasted too long. Once Simon Cadel left, it went downhill quickly, they were making terrible stories and a new entertainment manager to which Ruth Madoc (again) was launched. When a comedy is filmed in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be deciphered. Unfortunately, this went on so long that each joke broke 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series, it would have fallen like an all-time classic. As it is, it will be remembered to a great extent by the terrible last series.
