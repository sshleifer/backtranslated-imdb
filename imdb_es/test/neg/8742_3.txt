Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother, Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) is fighting a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed inventor husband Sid (John Tururro) lacks something in the emotion department. Unhappy with the new situation at home, his sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is well. Steven seems to be happier and even interested in the habits of life of his strange uncle; He even decides that he wants to change his name to Franz. Located in the early 60's, this drama is a bit funny ... change that crazy. Not being a fan of MacDowell, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; Although I liked the movie and it's not a total waste.
