The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought this because I like the adventures of the desert and in the box it says it's a drama. It certainly is not. <br /> <br /> This is a couple heading to Egypt to capture some desert drug dealers. <br /> <br /> This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which disappoints him a lot. It's pretty silly in parts. Depending on this, there are some scenes of good action and location. <br /> <br /> The cast is led by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest. <br /> <br /> One vision is enough for this movie. In general, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
