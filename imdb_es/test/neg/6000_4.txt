"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst movie since "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know nobody sees his films for their stories, but the plot of this is unusually scant, even by his standards, and while the choreography of The fight is up to their standards, the fight scenes (the two in their entirety) are ruined, as others have mentioned, by the frenetic and distracted camera work. Even the most serious fans of Jackie Chan should not really bother with this random offensive garbage, full of tricks and plugs. The beautiful and cheerful performance of Anita Yuen is one of the few redeeming virtues. For a good "Jackie serious" movie, I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
