Talk about false advertising! I lost an hour and twenty-five minutes watching this piece of trash and there was not a leisure suit, nor a platform shoe, nor dancing with pointy fingers, nor a single disco ball. I saw it on a Saturday night, and I ended up with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> From the initial scene, he will ask himself the question: "Where did that string come from and please, will it hang me too?" From their blatant bias against the driving skills of the Pennsylvania Dutch, to the brazen promotion of the seemingly eternal capabilities of Alienware laptops, to the cheap horror effects that come directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst movie that comes to theaters from The Grudge.
