This is not a good movie at all. I can not believe that after fifty years, this film receives the National Award when so many jewels of Marathi cinema have been systematically ignored. This is a very overrated movie that was very, very lucky. He received the National Award, obtained popular opinion and will now represent India before the international audience. Anyone with a marginal understanding of a good and quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I can not understand where to start. There are so many things that are wrong and missing in this movie that it is incredible that it has even been considered for the National Award. That this film is awarded as the best film that will be released this year shows the impartial judgment of the people holding the reins of Indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> The chosen theme is great. Is it important that such films be made? But only by people who are capable of handling them. Sandeep Sawant is not up to the task? not even close. His address is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but he is not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is not able to show the initial horror, the anxiety and then the desperate detachment and, nevertheless, the unsurpassable value of the grandfather. He loses our time in the hospital when we should have shown him the time we spent together. He is trying to cram everything without any priority. He does not understand his subject correctly and that really counts against him. <br /> <br /> However, the cast does not help Sawant either. Worst work ?? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actress and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Casting extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely regrettable. Having said that, she does everything possible to do an even terrible job in this movie. Should your MSW act have gone to the most responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash did not understand it. MSW's work is under constant emotional stress and, however, it is important for them to project a calm and strong exterior, as this is reassuring for patients. Asawari from Amruta Subhash seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Second worse? Arun Nalawade I have never seen a more wooden face in the Marathi film industry (although it abounds everywhere in today's Hindi cinema). He is the producer and so he chose himself; Without thinking twice, without consideration. Any good actor would have jumped into this role even if he had to pay the producer to do it, but Arun Nalawade would not let anyone else do it. On ambitious and obtuse, it helps to tear down the film more than all the others together. His performance lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is not inspired. The film technically lacks. It could well have been an FTII project work. <br /> <br /> On the positive side; Shining performance by Ashwin Chitale. It is surprising that such a child can perform such a respectable performance. He put to shame many of today's actors. Maybe unintentionally, but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance. In addition, Sandeep Kulkarni really gave a very credible performance. He really put in all his efforts and it shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> The 'reduced budget' can not be a valid argument to praise this movie. Lack of funds pursues all marathi movies. The Cricket and Hindi films sponge all the money and the rest is left to fight for the remains. It is an unfortunate state of affairs but it is not enough reason to praise any immature film that comes out. 'Doghi' was a brilliant movie and was also made on a small budget. 'Doghi' also lacked technique, but it was well researched and well done. He was abundant in details and supported by wonderful performances of all and that made him rich in cinema. Why did not he receive the accolades he so deserved? ?? it only shows my point of partial judgment. <br /> <br /> The lack of research and not funds, is what makes 'Shwaas' such a bad movie.
