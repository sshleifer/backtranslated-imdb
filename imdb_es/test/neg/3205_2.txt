This is a shame for the name of all the adorable and funny Critters saga. Why do writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to see it with all the quality standards? The Critters are cute and adorable as always, but the deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby. They are not so terrifying, horrifying, some of them as creepy and funny as they were portrayed in movies before. He used to love his porcupine shots, but now he's hidden as if he thought it was repetitive and boring. And what it is to kill and not eat. I thought this movie would have been great, but everything was so bad. Why did Ug have to be bad and killed by what is known as Charlie? This movie makes me sick. Misfortune! Misfortune! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
