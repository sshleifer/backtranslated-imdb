Okul "The School" is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again, the directors of the new generations finally come up with different ideas. Of course, it does not mean that everyone is great. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. Nor does he succeed in giving fear. So what is it? The actors are so normal, especially Deniz Akkaya is quite annoyed with the role of teacher. I'm sure it could have been better if it was tested more strongly. Maybe concentrate on a topic, how to make it scary or vice versa. But the directors have lost the goal this time. ** outside *****
