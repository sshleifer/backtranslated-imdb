Pink ?? Does anything really happen in this episode? Presents our two drivers, a slow thinking smiling idiot from a doctor and a completely interesting partner. There is no argument to talk about, childish humor, mixed with an extremely bad rhythm and incidental music. What else can you say, really? <br /> <br /> The end of the world? A marginal improvement, in which we see our first scenario of outer space. Later demolished by the contemporary bad mood, the thin logic like the paper, the very poor rhythm and the tired clichés of SF. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead? The best episode to date that shows what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write a dialogue with interesting characters, and integrate an intriguing plot. Dropped only by the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> Aliens of London / World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the procedures a bit serious, trying their best in extreme circumstances. Some elements of poorly written and misplaced soap operas appear in the foreground in these two episodes, and a return to rhythm, bad plot and humor / satire worth trembling. <br /> <br /> Dalek? It's not great, however, still far above the RTD rate to date. The rhythm and the script are fine (although the Doctor and Rose are still irritated). The effects and threat of the Dalek are presented well. The ending, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most famous enemy, in a tender and delicate mess, and converted a previously unseen threat into a squid of blue rubber that resembled a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The long game: the first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was an 80s cliché style. Even so, it was marred a little by its excessive habitual dependence on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to have a logical sense and, again, a poor rhythm. It is not as bad as your previous efforts, but it is forgotten instantly. <br /> <br /> Father's Day? The initial premise might have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic leave this episode from the beginning. In addition, they treat us a complete episode of the telenovela. Before you start thinking that all this has to do with characterization, remember, there is a big difference between the scarce Soap Opera and the characterization. On the positive side, it shows that RTD is not the worst screenwriter so far. <br /> <br /> The empty child / The doctor dances: this started in a mediocre way, with some valuable moments, and some illogical errors that not even a pupil of the primary school would do (well lit windows in a blackout, someone?). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes, showing us how she could have been an interesting partner. She could also act. Instead, we have Captain Jack, annoying and politically correct, as the new partner. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but enough. The rhythm and the script improved with a reasonably good plot, which makes these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I must be honest, except for a few examples, the current series had disappointed me so much that when I saw the trailer for another episode of 'Slitheen', I gave up and I did not. I do not submit to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, possibly the worst side of modern media, is basically used as a premise. There is no subtlety. Do we get any interesting social commentary like in The Running Man or Truman Show? Of course not. This is in an episode of RTD, so basically they are here to cynically try and attract the audience of such programs. Once again, the logic goes out the window, since we are located in the future to more than 200,000 years. RTD tries, without meaning, to put the horn in some history of "arcing" here, without other relevance than its own existence and when the villains reveal themselves in the end ... They make empty threats, and the Doctor smiles once more as an idiot for the climax! Faster than most RTD efforts, this one has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another mediocre delivery. <br /> <br /> The separation of the roads: the grand finale. More than a wet squid, literally. All the Dalek threat set in 'Dalek' collapses, as they become pathetic. So many holes in the plot guess this episode, with typically poor artifacts. The Daleks want to harvest human beings like Daleks, but then vaporize whole continents? Can Dalek vaporize these continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even on people so they can be saved in it. This ability can not be used to easily destroy the 'god' of Dalek? Can the Daleks vaporize entire continents, but they do not just attack satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and let him play? Is the doctor a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating his entire species to try to eliminate the Daleks? Leaving aside these and many other holes, they offer us the most incomparable solution ever conceived, combined with an almost useless arc of history. <br /> <br /> So, what can we say about the new series? All? <br /> <br /> Would this have won a second series if it was more than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as something more than not original and forgettable, if they were more than Doctor Who, and the name of RTD had been attached? I think not. <br /> <br /> Some people would make us think that we can not say anything against RTD, since we owe it for returning Doctor Who to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I would prefer not to have a badly planned and ill-conceived product produced at that price. I prefer to wait until someone can come and make a genuine effort. For the most part, this is the kind of childish garbage that gives SF a bad name, spoiling what is otherwise the most creative genre.
