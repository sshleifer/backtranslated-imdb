Before accepting a job as a critic, I never went to movies like this and, therefore, I was happily unaware that in the soul of the Hollywood movie is a spirit that deeply hates women and that thrives by putting their little knees on the silver screen for everything to empathize with or revile. Or is it just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another apparently sweet, innocent and beautiful woman turned into a lethal weapon. The guy who warns us that beneath each pair of swinging eyes and nesting instincts is a wild-eyed beast that guarantees that everyone's life within a 50-mile radius will be hell. <br /> <br /> This month's specimen is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler)), whose simple dreams include having her own little house, a fountain in the yard and a home entertainment system from Mondo. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the bulb waiter who picks up McCool's night with the intention of stealing, has a less material orientation. The type of person who drinks beer from a toilet plunger, prefers to cuddle up in the house of his dead mother with few comforts, except his collection of snow globes. <br /> <br /> In that same low-rent bar, the Devil in the red dress also runs into Randy's cousin Carl (the fun Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis . When things go south in a few hours, enter the widower detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men suffer great infatuations for the leopard-progeny progeny of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell that force them to do things that common sense would normally contraindicate. Like getting involved in the first place. <br /> <br /> Multiple points of view and flashbacks combine the news from the first page about how easy it is to be a victim of libido, especially if you are a man. As each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant, his desire to own The Jewel colors the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a reasonably fun way. But it's a fun from the same source that tells you that popcorn stuff really tastes like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first Norwegian commercial film and music video director Harald Zwart, and his record is clear. during some of the fantasy segments, including one on car wash, soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate. It is also the debut project of the production company owned by Michael Douglas, who found his niche like a big baseball in a bingo hall. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that Dillon and Tyler will win gold statues for this one. Given the unidimensionality of their exaggerated film noir type characters, you can not really blame them. Several minor roles drag unexpected guests: Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as much as Utah's bully as his even more terrifying brother. (Finally, an exit for all that aggression). <br /> <br /> This movie talks about the dynamics between men and women, or between men and their mothers. But ultimately, you're likely to find more lasting psychological truths in an episode of Bugs Bunny. I'll say it's better, more fun, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to look for based on what is ranked lowest on the misogynist scale?
