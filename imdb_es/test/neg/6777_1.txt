I saw a cartoon accidentally on the television one night when I could not sleep. It did not help in the least. I found myself looking at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. With pleasure, I could never see this caricature again, just for that face. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, I love fairy tales and lullabies. But this twisted and terrifying interpretation is simply disturbing. It's mainly the cruel laugh, and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and I still have nightmares about it. Please, I urge you not to let your children see this. It's far, very, VERY scary. Please, I beg you, stay away.
