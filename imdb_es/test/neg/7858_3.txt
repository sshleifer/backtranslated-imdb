Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to hell and tells the story of his life to His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on his relationships with women throughout his life, and in particular, his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we cut Henry and His Excellency for a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the movie because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story of a man's life and it's very boring. I saw him with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was silly, despite Lubitsch's touch. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he is on the screen like his grandfather and there were some funny moments of dialogue. The color turned it into a good show, but it was not enough to prevent this sweeper from entering the rejected pile. In the same mold as "Its A Wonderful World" and "You Can not Take It With You", so, as expected, was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of which is interesting and without a history of any interest. Bored, sentimental and the biggest wet squib of an ending I can remember ...
