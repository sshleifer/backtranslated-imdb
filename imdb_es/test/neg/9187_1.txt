Jeff Fahey has such attentive eyes and a fuzzy and insidious smile that every character he plays looks villain; therefore, it does not really work as a good boy of the piece, the public is just waiting for his character to break and start flying people. Drew Barrymore, fresh out of his acclaimed role as "Poison Ivy," must have made this movie simply as a favor for director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer for "Ivy"); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), has been immediately hit, which leaves us with no one to look at, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who has not had a single moment in the camera since "Blade Runner") . This witty script, by Michael Angeli, refers to a police cartoonist who draws the face of his own wife from the testimony of a murder witness, and while it is not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better for an hour-long television series. This movie made by cable is short in inspiration (starting with the casting) and shorter in surprises. * since ****
