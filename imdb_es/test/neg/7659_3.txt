With a cast of mostly low-level stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), terrible special effects (of course, it was the 70s, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade), and a story that is so ridiculous that one might want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been SEATED ON EARTH. <br /> <br /> Even Academy Award winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can not keep this "bird" in the air. <br /> <br /> The implausibility of the third movie (the plane is submerged in the Bermuda Triangle) is much more believable than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid the "Concorde" at all costs!
