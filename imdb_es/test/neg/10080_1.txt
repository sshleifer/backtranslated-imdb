You could have put the characters on the island for any reason and have the same movie. The first had an original story, the second stole from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy, the story seemed to have been completely ignored. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and see how they run for their lives. That was all there was to do. The special effects were decent but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater in your local area, wait and see for a dollar. I would not even bother to rent it. That would be too much money for this thriller.
