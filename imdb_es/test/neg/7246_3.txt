Coincidentally I have seen this movie in TCM. Very bad acting, low budget and bad plot are the impressions I felt when watching the movie. The only highlight of the film was to see the tender young Rita Moreno (23 years old), playing an Indian teenager in love with a man over 50 years old. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), only that Lolita more innocent. She bounces up and down like a young woman from the 1950s, almost as if you expect her to chew gum, falling on this old man, ready to give him anything, while playing with him as if he were an obstacle to him. Any man in his 50s who had a beautiful virgin teenager and willing to do ANYTHING for him and be his girlfriend, would be crazy not to take advantage of her. It is a pity that the board of censorship when this film premiered did not allow a further expansion of a character like Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is the appearance of Rita Moreno in the movie.
