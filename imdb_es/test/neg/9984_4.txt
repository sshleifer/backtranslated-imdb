Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of the epics of swords and sandals such as 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of making movies was in disuse at the end of the seventies). Rather, it looks more like a cross between a soft core porn movie and a nasty video. At least, the shortened version of 150 minutes does. I've never seen the full 210-minute version, but judging from the descriptions on this page, it would seem to be closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a nasty video. <br /> <br /> As one would expect from a movie produced by the 'Penthouse' editor, a lot of naked flesh is seen, and the film lovingly catalogs Caligula's sexual perversions, including her incestuous romance with her sister Drusilla. . What may be unexpected from the editor of a magazine so closely associated with the male heterosexual lifestyle is that there is as much male and female flesh on display and clearly homoerotic connotations in many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced with an equal obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass tried to kill two taboos with a stone. (It's a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen movie should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a bloody film should be called 'Gore'). The characters are condemned to death or mutilated in various sadistic ways, and there is a lovely scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their more lazy lifestyles, so the film's focus on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. However, I wonder if such concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were established during the reign of Commodus, an emperor as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case, the filmmakers saw the need to turn their film into a mix of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both films are artistically much better than 'Caligula'. <Br /> <br /> The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with some exceptions, such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes Caligula proper madness. (Proper, that is, in the context of this film, the real Caligula was certainly cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was really mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to participate in such a bad production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Lady of the British Empire with a past as a porn star), it was probably related to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the servants and the sordid, but only Heaven knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike other famous theatrical actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look at home at the movies, but here he gives an interpretation worthy of the role of Nerva, a decent and honorable senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film, any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl in a dunghill. <br /> <br /> Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become a classic cult of decadence. (You can question whether Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for the film). However, the film does not succeed on any other level, either as an art cinema or as a study of the politics of the dictatorship. Even seen as erotic it is second class. 4/10
