Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was attracted to see this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the "worst movie of all time". Needless to say, this one won indisputably. It is long and extensive, and it has no purpose or plot of what I can gather. A film about a murderous child raised from a fetus that grew out of the womb simply does not take place within its vcr. If you are extremely bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer to keep your sanity, stay away.
