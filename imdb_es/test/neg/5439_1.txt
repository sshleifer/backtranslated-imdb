I would give this film a zero if I could. How someone could rate it higher is beyond me. Until I saw Rollerball, this was my choice for the worst movie of a major studio with a real budget (stating that Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood as the worst never really does not say much, they're supposed to be bad) <br /> <br /> Tim Curry's mother must have needed surgery or something for him to accept this unwise trash. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid track record with Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they should have changed the title to 'Africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. You would think someone would have bothered to read the script. <br /> <br /> It would be better if you saw Battlefield: Earth again instead of wasting time. Congo makes you wish for the return of MST3K
