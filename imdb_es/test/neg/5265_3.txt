"Decent ordinary criminal" is sad because he is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously has no chance of doing so apparently due to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. An abysmal failure in the Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who enjoys making fun of the police and his competition has become a kind of popular hero in his own mind, this film manages to be slightly funny when it tries to be fun, a little more boring when it tries to be interesting, and forget about the sentimental, touching or endearing, but also takes those qualities. "Decent ordinary criminal" has a clumsy script, a naive direction, the execution of a man, a thin story, a poor cast, a mediocre performance and, finally, he loses himself and plunges himself into a mire of desperate mediocrity . Pass on this. (RE)
