The blame for this terrible film rests with the director, Martin Campbell. After seeing some of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first concerts as a director. He had a more than decent cast to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that did not make any sense at all. Where was his head ............... he was on drugs? I was waiting for this movie just for Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short filming program and Campbell simply had to "hit him". I can not imagine that the story that Campbell directed will approach the story that the writer wrote. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slipped under their chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did a good fight scene with Bacon. She really did 'let go'. It is unfortunate that I have to fill more space just to stay within the guidelines of what the IMDb requires because I really do not have anything else to say about this uninspiring movie. You do not have to be forced to be a 'windbag' when you criticize a terrible movie and you want the IMDb to change the amount of words to complete a critique.
