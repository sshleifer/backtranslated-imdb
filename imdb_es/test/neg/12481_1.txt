This Fulci Schlocker of the last days is a totally abysmal mix that deals with an incurable player (Brett Halsey) that decides the style of Blue Beard to pay his increasing debts to seduce some of the ugliest bitches I have ever seen. they turn out to be wealthy widows! The script written by Fulci also manages to incorporate some elements of black comedy, which only result in a business without grace that involves a corpse that will not stay still, a victim of the opera singer who will not stop singing, etc. . The theme of doppelganger comes directly from THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE, although, in this case, the two people communicate through pre-recorded radio messages! In the end, I can not say that I am surprised that this movie does not show signs of the sophistication of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON (1970), which he looks at in various ways and is content to simply accumulate the disgusting bloody scene. (but not very convincing) the effects of the dismembered limbs and the crushed or melted faces with which, unfortunately, Fulci had been fully associated.
