** Warning: this review may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is good: the boy is taken by a bully and is educated to behave like a vicious pit bull. controlled mainly in case your neck is on or off your neck. <br /> <br /> However, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the limits of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny Knowing a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who has to be the most confident fool a man was, along with his imbecile, babbling infinitely, unattractive stepdaughter, Victoria ( Kerry Condon). By the way, I was surprised when I found out that Victoria had to be 18 years old, she looked at me when she was 25 or 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny shows up again, hurt, what does Sam do, if not take him straight home? Danny is out for 2 days, but these imbeciles take him to a hospital? Nooooo I do not know if they even called a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, Danny obviously is not a mentally stable person, this is evident from the beginning, but Sam takes him to his house, where both he and his stepdaughter could have been severely damaged or even killed by this strange and young man. <br /> <br /> Why Morgan Freeman took on this insipid role in this stupid movie that I can not even begin to guess. Surely Mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny; Now you speak of a son of a weapon that is difficult to kill. The car in which Bart finds himself is full of bullets that would have rivaled the disappearance of Bonnie and Clyde. We believe he is dead, but no. <br /> <br /> Then we have another car accident, and once again, old Bart escapes unharmed. <br /> <br /> Besides that, we also have Danny fight with half a dozen guys at the same time, plus a scene in which Danny has decided that he does not want to fight anymore. I do not care how much a person does not want to fight, when it comes to fighting or dying, I think anybody would fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the topic Title: this film is about 40 kilometers from the limits of reality, as we know it. It is not just a case of suspending belief, it is completely beyond that. <br /> <br /> Also, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a good lady, instead of the prostitute that Bart claimed he was, mixed up with Bart and his gang and was shot. Maybe it was my fault, I was distracted at the time of the scene, but it seemed very unlikely that she and Bart had ever crossed paths. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10, and that's being generous.
