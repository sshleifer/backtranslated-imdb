This movie did not look anything like the book. <br /> <br /> Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the movie were things that were not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment to me when I enjoyed the book so much and then seeing how this movie destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie is not worth seeing how far the book is.
