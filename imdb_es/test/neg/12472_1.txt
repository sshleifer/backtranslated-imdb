Although I've seen Sal√≤, I do not know if the excrement tastes like cake. If it does, this "movie" is accurately titled. So much fiber, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery, it just does not clean the palate. Leave the taste of time lost in the mouth of the mind, and if I could throw up this movie and recover that expansion / expense, I would. The arrest was more exciting. The director must be forced to wear a donkey hat, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could not save this semi-professional projection of a certain failure. A waste of time, a loss of mind. ** Do not be fooled by the tooth Dominique Swain: a competent eye candy that was in the remake of Lolita, less tragic and wiser than Sue Lyon, although in no way is better. However, a previously competent turn of the screw does not make it a skillful and skillful person. You need crafts for that, not junk, which is what this movie is. The reels belong to the girls' bathroom, reddened until the pipes explode, while Christina Wayne, director and without director, must do 5-10 in the study room. Look at anything else and pass this class, by (bye), forever!
