A trio sits at a restaurant table and stares at the space. Later, they lean on a rail and look across the Channel to England. A man works a hoe repeatedly in his garden, only his head and upper torso are visible on the screen. A man and a woman watch another man urinate against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots takes about a minute. Absolutely no information is given that can not be given to us in approximately a quarter of the time. The editor must have been half asleep. I know it was. <br /> <br /> The movie opened with an amazing shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. One's throat rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighbor and begins to follow them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour, while Schotte and his friends unfairly exchange insults with each other and with strangers. Finally, the thread of the box is retaken, but moves slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic pattern already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, in movies like this, location recording provides a kind of environment that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. The houses of the French people are linked together in long lines. The fronts of the house lean directly on the pavement, without steps. The fronts show virtually no decoration and are virtually indistinguishable. The flat agricultural lands are featureless. What could have been one of the most interesting episodes, a visit to a stone fort on the coast, bores the trio until they begin to behave like knots and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> The performance is minimal. Nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. No jokes. Nothing funny happens. The policeman has a face almost as interesting as Randy Quaid's. The baby, a tall, tall blonde, looks like the type of steroid shot putter that East Germans used to use at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I sat for more than an hour before giving up. . Maybe I'll try another time. Unless I've missed something or become a messy Monty Python routine towards the end, I do not think it's good for you to rent it out.
