I saw this on Sci Fi and, in retrospect, I'm not sure how I managed to see it at all times. This is absolute garbage. It's not a B movie, it's a "D movie" at best. <br /> <br /> Basically, this grim reaper you see on a horse (and sometimes not one) is going to kill everything on its way somewhere in the Midwest. from America. A large number of people are missing (in fact murdered) and a group of op types does not match and they go to look for them. The best part of this movie, I'll tell you now, is that there are some really cute girls. Let me now ruin this by telling you that everyone, except the least cute, cut off their heads, cut them or hit them so hard with a combat weapon that the head explodes. That's not spoiler ... The gore in this movie is exaggerated and really grotesque. It also has no real purpose. <br /> <br /> This is what is good: the scenarios look good, the actors sometimes act well, the costumes and accessories, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can imagine, sucks. Much of the evil is in the edition. Sometimes it simply changes from a fast action scene to a real, quiet and inactive scene. Sometimes the characters do things that are not understandable and always divide, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. It seems that they unwittingly divide among themselves, but they also seem to know that they are dividing all the time and agree, even though they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies everywhere. People are dying from right to left. Nothing in this movie is in the least plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and I really do not understand how this immortal and indestructible killer of the bad guy was able to be stopped in the end, and frankly, I do not care. . Too stupid, hilariously bad does not make sense during this movie and I really do not mind listing everything here. And they're all very serious throughout the test when it's almost ridiculously bad ... just horrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete waste of time. There is no excuse to see this, unless the only channel you receive is SciFi and you are tied to a chair in front of the television. But if you're not obligated, it's better to do a crossword puzzle, throw a Frisbee or just think. There are many B movies much better than you can see. <br /> <br /> My last year in high school, my friend and I, in the visual communication and design class, made a long movie trailer for our own movie (There was not a full movie, just a trailer really long) and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with the premiere. It was better work than this movie. That really says something about this and I'm baffled and worried about the reason why Sci Fi would show something like that when there are so many good movies at a low price that they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen. I've ever endured that it was worse than this is Raptor Island (another brilliant SciFi work), although it had a smoother flow and easier to follow than this movie, but this is very close and is definitely second on my list of Worst movies I've seen.
