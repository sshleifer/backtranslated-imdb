This is one of the movies that killed the "spaghetti" western. Not only does he lose something in the translation, it is also a total chaos of editing. Any of the fragments has been edited or republished for an English version. In any case, it has little or no sense, period. It makes the films of "Trinity" and "Man without name" of Eastwood look like John Ford / John Wayne in comparison. Nothing in this movie is original. Somewhere in there there is a beginning, a middle and (finally) an end. Except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems quite nice. The rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career decisions.
