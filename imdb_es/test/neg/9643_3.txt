The story is not very strong. Do not expect a type of "Bourne identity" movie. It started strong, Tara speaks Russian and even sounded credible. (Not that I'm the Russian language expert.) Moscow had that dark, depressing look that gave this movie the potential, he still believed in it. Very bad, it only took half an hour to see that they really missed the place with this one. Acting was poor, maybe because the story itself was not very strong. There is a part in the movie in which Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is talking on the phone with C.I.A., as if you were listening to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? Too bad that the writer did not even try to give depth to the main characters. Also, a little easy and cheap. <br /> <br /> The positive point is almost all the scenes in which Tara Reid is. It's not that he's acting so well, in fact, he does not. But she really looks great in this movie. In general, it was a bit disappointing. Rental of material ?? Perhaps.
