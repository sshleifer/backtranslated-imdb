This is horrible even for a television movie. I can not believe it took three people to write this movie. I'm not familiar with the novel on which this movie was based, but it has to be better than this. I prefer to see a "Full House" marathon that this stupid movie. I gave it 2 out of 10 stars just because it got better with the ads.
