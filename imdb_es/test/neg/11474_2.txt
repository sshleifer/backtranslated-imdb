Bad bad bad. How are movies made like this? Badly written, badly acted; I could go on, but why bother? As a side note, keep in mind that the names of the characters are the same as the actors who interpret them: this is a clear gift that no one on the set is interested enough in their role to bother to learn the names of another person's characters!
