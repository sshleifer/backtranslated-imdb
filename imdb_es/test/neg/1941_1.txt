Does anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K etc.? Before, when it came to doing amazing and fun things, instead of watching Bam Margera act like an asshole, spoiled 5 years old, aspiring rock star / super. <br /> <br /> The show used to be amazing, however, of Bam. fame and wealth have led him to believe, that now we enjoy acting in a childish and idiotic way, more than the really great things, which used to be in ex. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive, there is nothing new, except the annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments ... The only thing we see is Bam Margera, so busy showing us how much he cares. , how much money he received or whatever. <br /> <br /> I really do not have much else to say, except to return CKY2K, because Bam stinks ... <br /> <br /> I enjoy watching Steve- or, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more.
