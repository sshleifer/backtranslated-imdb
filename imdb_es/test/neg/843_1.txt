This is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins's _The_Woman_In_White_, but the only resemblance to that story was the character names, time period and settings. If they were going to change the story so thoroughly, I do not understand why they had to keep pretending that it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It is much better.
