Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It is a pity that Diana Rigg left the original program in the 1960s due to mistreatment by the producers, and MacNee probably regretted it as much as any fan, it is not known how long the program lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was fine as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all the quality and aspects of Rigg's episodes; all that was missing was Rigg / Macnee's chemistry. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf: a Macnee in decline, an annoying Purdey, and who the hell is this Gambit guy. In addition, humor was forced and poor; I was granted that I only saw some of the episodes, because that was all I COULD see, but I think I understood the idea. Try what you can and do, it's almost impossible to resurrect an old program like a new format or movie.
