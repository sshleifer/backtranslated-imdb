It is a pity that such an unconvincing plot hangs in such picturesque places, with some documentary style reports introduced for longer. A shorter film may have kept the tension a little longer, and a more charismatic advantage may not have shattered its lines so much. The woman was also not allowed to do enough, which resulted in a nice but boring affair. It develops toward the end, but the redemption of the main actor is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. It's not horrible, just a pity. Little exciting but nice enough to adorn the television hours of the first few hours.
