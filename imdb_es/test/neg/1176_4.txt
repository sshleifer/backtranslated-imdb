I have seen this movie quite disconcerted. I'm not sure if I was trying to be a gore fest of horror in an adventure like Rob Zombie or an exploration of real events. <br /> <br /> In either case, your brand was lost. It is not particularly accurate from the historical point of view with characters cut and changed for the sake of history. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither convincing nor bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this movie could have followed this path without spoiling the overall effect.
