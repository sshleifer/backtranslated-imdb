I give the program a six for the fact that the program was, in fact, a platform for Damon Wayans, since the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, he had a lot of problems with humor and I felt that, in fact, he was measure to get a laugh instead of letting the jokes leave the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a person who does tricks. He is PHENOMENAL in the movies, but in the program he was there for the joke and although I loved it, I felt that laughter was more important than plausibility. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle I've loved her since House Party. and I enjoyed it at School Daze and Martin, this was a great role for her and she made a great decision by choosing this comedy to co-star. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals in the program, but Jay was more the woman who fed her husbands husbands the lines and followed their path of unorthodox discipline because she might have felt that it worked <br /> <br /> Jr Just stupid, his character should have been well developed and although He has his moments of greatness, we go back to stupidity as if he had not learned anything, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Not to mention that most situations (in the episodes I've seen) seem to focus on him. <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian, it seemed to me that her boyfriend's character was more interesting than her. (You'd better stick to the movies, the writers should have done more to show their intelligence, but it's not stereotyped enough.) <br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think the writers set their character more on the show apart from the parents and Franklin. <br /> <br /> Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry) that only lasted one season. They did a great job of casting for this little genius (it would have been a great effort if Jr. had been the smart one, but they also showed their disadvantages) <br /> <br /> In short, this sitcom is a wonder. thing and it is a tribute to Cosby Show is well done, I love the show and I would have liked it to have stayed for longer. I can not wait to see the end of the series.
