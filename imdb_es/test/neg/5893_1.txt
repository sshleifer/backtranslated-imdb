It was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (does not the stopwatch stop for injured players or the loss of helmets at Texas football games?) And not so much redemption (So your dad takes the shit away from you? time, and then he will love you and make it worthwhile). <br /> <br /> Make the film about a team and its search for a championship Or make a film about a player within a team and its staff Fight but, instead, this film tried to do everything and approached more than a couple of meters. The book probably showed the whole story much better; the film should have chosen an element of the story and continue with that. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from character dialogue to game flashes and then another character dialogue months later without really telling him who the people were or why they were important: the Marshal of field that called his brother to take care of the mother, what happened to that? Because the mother was consistent at the end of the final game, does that mean she is not crazy anymore? His redeeming quality was the soundtrack. Buy that and then see SportsCenter highlights while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
