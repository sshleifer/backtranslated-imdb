It is a bonanza of male crushing. I saw this in science fiction a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting to me. It could have been a good movie, and the plot itself does not look like a male critique, but certain specific references to men become really annoying. Although I could still watch the movie because at least it tries to redeem itself insinuating that perhaps the women in the film are not as violent as they say, but it does not compensate the really exhausting man. -beating. I mean, I can understand a bit, it's part of the plot of the movie, but come on, it gets very tired after a while. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept to become homosexuals so easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be a minority so large as to go "in the closet". It is too incredible. There are too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would resist because it is totally implausible. I mean, I know it's science fiction, and I love science fiction, but the best science fiction has at least a hint that it's possible, and this is too unlikely. The phrase "Truth is stranger than fiction" arose because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcome, but the truth is not always the case. This movie is not that. Apart from that, the film has a good performance and the eventual morality of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, we redeemed it a little, but not enough.
