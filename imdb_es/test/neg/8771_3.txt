I am a Christian, and I have seen many Christian movies, but this is very bad. They try to do this good, but I think it's too hard for them. <br /> <br /> - You can see that the movie is badly bent in many places. - You can almost think that the main people in this movie were the only ones left behind. I think there will be many more. <br /> <br /> - The quality is bad and the acting could also have been better. The story is not so bad, but it could have been better. The only advantage I give is the story in this movie, but I can not rate it more than 3/10. Watch "Left Behind" instead!
