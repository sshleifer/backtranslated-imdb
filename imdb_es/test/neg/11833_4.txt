Films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all the films for me, in the hands of a perceptive artist who examines all the small twisted details of the mundane. French cinema seems to be often very good at this kind of thing, and I love French cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was about the mundane. I did not have much of a plot. They were just characters who lived in a city, very normal people, and all that happened. But it was not very interesting, and it was not examined very insightfully. The movie caught a bit of humor, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And although I can not think much about the film being specifically wrong, it failed at almost every level to do something right. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this movie. Many of them seemed similar, so it was difficult to find out who was who and what their relationships were with each other. I do not mind striving to understand a movie, or even watch a particularly complex movie more than once to clarify the details, but this was a puzzle that is not worth solving for me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the cinematography was nice, functional, not bright, but nice. The camera often captured some pretty post-type shots. But he rarely found the small details really interesting. <br /> <br /> I've seen a handful of not so good movies so far at the Seattle International Film Festival, but this was the only one that could not get any applause when the credits rolled. I felt a great sigh of collective relief when the movie finally ended. But I guess there are probably some people who would like to. <br /> <br /> 4/10
