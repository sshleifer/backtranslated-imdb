It is said that there are some people who really ADMIRE the Monogram films. Well, and why not? Monogram Studios lived on a Plus cost basis; cost, more than enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of muscatel robust from time to time. Sure, they're cheap. But let's be honest: they are coarse, quick, philistine, vulgar, but stimulating. They have no pretension. They are designed to distract the audience for about an hour at the bottom of a double bill. And what happens if John Wayne gallops down the Wild West along a road lined with telephone poles? This is not art, it is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Flight to Mars." At the beginning, when we first meet the characters, a man could present his partner abruptly, avoiding any tedious subtlety: "Teacher, this is my girlfriend and assistant, who is a space scientist and a beautiful woman. She loves me but she is getting impatient with me because I am always involved in my scientific work, maybe you can steal her, marry her, give her the babies and the home where she yearns, if necessary, I will die for this, travel to see her dreams come true. Besides, she likes it a bit rough. " It saves a lot of writing and shooting time, does not it? That is what people mean when they say that a narrative is "fast". (This was filmed in five days). Why should we have to allude to these things? I mean, what the hell is this, a cheap science fiction movie or Henry James? Actually, this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie. It's in color, for one thing. "Cinecolor" to be exact. (You can say that you do not recognize any other "color"). And watch the cast. The female advantage is discarded, as is usual with Monogram, but male leads are definitely up on List B. Cameron Mitchell as the reporter, however, to get to his step as a male leader, who, on second thought, never would. did. And Arthur Franz as the pipe smoking chief scientist, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And, for sci-fi fans, how about this pair of aces: Morris Ankrum and John Litel? It really does not make much sense to describe the plot in detail. The five members of the crew land on Mars, where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, to the fact that they have five digits and willow babies in short skirts. And they learned English from listening to our transmissions. American emissions, that is, judging by his speech. They are led by a sinister clique that tries to hijack the spacecraft, build many imitations of it and colonize the earth. They do not have success. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. The men walk around a couple of spare sets, wearing black suits with stylized lightning bolts printed on their breasts and scarlet capes fluttering behind them. Their names consist exclusively of phonemes in English - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The little Martian who falls in love with Arthur Franz is called Alita, with a small Indo-European appendage, and she already knows what it is to kiss. <br /> <br /> In general, I found it as fast as it was meant to be, but boring too. The story is that of any 1930s series by Buck Rogers. Once the Earthlings and Martians meet and it is established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister agenda, that is all. In two hours, even an indifferent scriptwriter could turn this into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is made with numbers, the dialogue has no brightness, the action is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> However, fans dedicated to Monogram productions should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the opposite French egghead, dedicated "A Bout de Souffl√©" to Monogram, so they could not have been so bad.
