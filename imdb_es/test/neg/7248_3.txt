Yes, Edward G. gives us a retro view of the world of criminal defense. First he is a too enthusiastic prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, though briefly by DeForrest Kelly), then he is so full of remorse that his only consolation is the bottle. Add a tired romance, a genuinely quick descent to hardship and you have no qualms about who you defend, and the next thing you know: Shazam! Lawyer of the black leg (God I love that phrase). He sees the light just in time to save his beloved and tired from the chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> But in reality, the action of the court is pure melodrama. Watch him beat a witness, watch him drink poison, watch him argue passionately as he grabs a bullet hole in his chest. Prepare for the melodrama. <br /> <br /> However, the scream of the movie is Jayne Russell. With curves that defy the laws of gravity and an IQ close to absolute zero, she is something to be seen. He even sings a little.
