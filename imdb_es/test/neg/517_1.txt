There is part of a sequence in which a little water rushes to the sunken plane, everything else that happens in this film is archival material for Airport 77. You can even distinguish Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots. A total robbery? Well, almost by definition. There may be more footage in this movie than in Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> All the new material, the actors sitting on a plane in flight, is insipid and terrible on all levels. Dennis Weaver is totally lost in a low-career film, although that is true for anyone other than film director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many false names needed to continue working. <br /> <br /> There is a level of low professionalism that makes this movie a waste of time, it would actually be better if someone filmed it without any technical knowledge, because Ray has enough knowledge on how to put together a scene in the worst old-school television. Fashion that this film, like most of his films, is totally devoid of life. The worst type of hacking work. The worst kind of movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of film is a waste of money, an issue in which the crew at all levels are ghosts who expect to get the meager paycheck they can and that no one will see or know that they appeared / I participated in this scam. There are so many people who want to make films that it is disgusting to see Ray burn the money he is given so that he does nothing but complete the time. <br /> <br /> His comment track is interesting because he has to start by explaining that he is really Fred Ray since he is not accredited in the film itself. That tricked me into seeing him, do not let him fool you.
