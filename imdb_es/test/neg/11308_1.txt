This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen Nielson. This movie simply does not have what it needs to be fun. I think the reason why Naked Gun and similar movies is that they did not demand that Nielson be funny. He simply played the roles as directly as he could, while all the comedy that was developed was mostly visual. But when you put it in a movie where it has to be funny, it's not. The film had only a good part, and this can be considered as a spoiler by some, and that the initial credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it could have been good. I did not intend to see this movie when I saw it, and the only reason I saw it was because someone gave it to me in a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only movie I've ever seen. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100.
