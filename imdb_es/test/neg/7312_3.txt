Well, I have to say that I have this movie and I just like the ending. The movie is boring and slow, but the final fight is very funny. Let's just say that if the fake bird did not attack the main evil guy, this movie would be a 0 out of 10. The bird, although it turns it into a 3. If you are really bored or want something terrible to see, rent this and move fast. to the final battle.
