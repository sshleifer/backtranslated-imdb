I just watched a terrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A critic of Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) was right when he wrote "From A to Zzzzzzzzz". The story is about an English colonialist idiot coming to Malaysia to "civilize the savages", so to speak, and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute who speaks English fluently, who serves the English colonialists and teaches their native language in exchange for ... well, the film never makes it clear, but I can assume that he gives money or something like that. It goes without saying that the film focuses much more on the "dormant" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love story is aggravated by his culture, his soap opera and his own limitless stupidity in every important decision he makes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So yes, The movie has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things that I rented it for first: an exotic place beautifully photographed, and a woman even more beautifully photographed and exotic that interprets the dictionary to sleep, Jessica Alba My friend told me that this fucking movie was the most beautiful and damn was that he was right. She's not a great actress, and it's not all bad for Malaysia, and it's pretty obvious that they use a double body for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that is more than sexy, but also beautiful by the way it is a concert for violin by Vivaldi or a painting by Rembrandt. <br /> <br /> (PD) Excuse all the feminists who discourage you. objectifying women, the "male gaze", etc., etc., but I hope you can understand that I do not want to disrespect you.
