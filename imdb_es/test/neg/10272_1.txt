In a nutshell, this miniseries was terrible. Let me count the forms. 1. Absurd tracing 2. Over-acting. 3. Scatter approach to the characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create the interest of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie can not even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. Sorry, I have not read this award-winning novel, so I judge it only as a movie, but it really sucks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You see the great variety and want to try them, but suddenly they retire and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters introduced and never drawn. There are enough stories and characters in this movie to create a series of 20 episodes, however, we have less than four hours to summarize everything. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction shots from Ed Harris than you will find in 10,000 monkeys. The rhythm is extraordinarily slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so exaggerated that their characters are not credible. The character of Joanne Woodward is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The metaphor of the persistent river becomes trite. <br /> <br /> And, probably, the most absurd part of the movie: the cat. This evil and vengeful cat that follows the hero to scratch him and his seat covers ... well, come on, it's not even good Stephen King! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character in the film, and one that is not well drawn, is John Voss, the disturbed child whose final act of desperation explains the only plot device that works in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> In summary, there is little here to inspire. The drama is poor melodrama. It is a terrible effort.
