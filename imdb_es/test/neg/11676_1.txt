Good. I really tried to take advantage of the silly and surreal (called) humor that this film pretends to be. I have been told that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than the one that was sent to the United States (imagine!), And has less political references. Apart from all that, I found this sexual / political farce as boring and useless as standard pornography. The female center cable is easy for the eyes and could act. I would love to see her in a movie that is not pink, where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no, not the ones you're thinking about). It is obvious that Japan can (and does) produce as much garbage as other countries. I could not recommend this to anyone, with the remote possibility that someone has a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
