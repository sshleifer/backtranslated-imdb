Apart from the shooting scene, I felt that the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played those roles while they slept. The dialogue was marginally tolerable (and there was a lot of it, nobody sat quietly in this movie), the plot was on the whole map as if they could not decide how many subjects to include in the story, there was no subtlety. Not at all: the omen hit you between the eyes and they took you through the nose throughout most of the story (I think they added all the dialogue to make sure you did not miss anything), and the editing really had to adjust (each) The actor's screen time was more quantity than quality (again, too much dialogue). <br /> <br /> The whole story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions very similar to how the day-to-day events seemed GREAT in high school, but in the grand scheme they really were not that important. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Mose, beat Button, killed the dog, all the things that would make Boss and Charley's blood go up, but the importance was diluted by all the "deep and meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the film, these guys worked together for 10 years and now they're ablating these things? The only time there was not much dialogue was at the shooting scene, which is probably why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gave Annette Bening a hairbrush! The strands of hair around her face that were (I suppose) to make her look a little more romantic actually made her look a little deranged. If she worked outside the home, it would make more sense. Also, why was not she already married? There seemed to be several single men "kind and gentle" (his words) in the city, apart from the marshal and his friends. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want it either (a plot device usual in other films). She stayed locked in the house most of the time and did not really seem to have much connection with the people of the city. It makes you wonder ...... <br /> <br /> In general, the film was too long, too talkative and too ingenious for me. It felt like a star vehicle with a lot of screen time for the big stars, but not enough depth of character to interest me, despite all the dialogue.
