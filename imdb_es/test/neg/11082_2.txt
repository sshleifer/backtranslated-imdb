The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and my head hurts. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask all film schools, could you teach future directors how to keep a camera steady? Shaking the camera like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks causes a headache. <br /> <br /> The film is also primarily a visual medium that directors may want to point their camera at in the general direction of the action. The film also requires light to work. Maybe a light source should be used to see the action on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but there's nothing scary about seeing the pitch blackness for minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> In this case, showing the film upside down does not indicate confusion on the screen, it indicates confusion in the editing booth. <br /> <br /> One last note for the director I'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly false CGI campfire. Honestly, I can not for my life think of one. <br /> <br /> Now, to the screenwriter. Try to make at least one nice character. I prefer two or more, but a decent person to whom I can root or worry could help. Also, if you are going to have flashbacks, make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If it's going to have a surprise ending, it's probably better if it does not contradict everything that comes before. And try to add some sophisticated terms to a cave movie. You may have wanted to start with caving. <br /> <br /> The Cavern is a pretty bad movie, badly shot with a confusing, improbable and anticlimactic ending.
