Parrots? Parrots? I have been around this old land longer than most and I have seen almost all the westerns they have produced. The history of the old west is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most badly produced, directed and performed stories I've seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but it is obvious that he was operating with a very small budget that <br /> <br /> played a different role in this insult to intelligence. I'm happy to have received this show. It was bad enough to have to sit down and watch the movie, as well as the crazy commercials. Once again, there was not an actor who became convincing. I expected it to improve as the three days progressed. INCORRECT! I am ashamed to say that I wasted 4 1/2 hours of the little time I have left.
