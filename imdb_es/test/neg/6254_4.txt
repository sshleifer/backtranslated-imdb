CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> starring: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck , Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> argument: a group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three boys, go to a game when suddenly their truck breaks and they take refuge in a nearby cabin. Soon, they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an invisible murderer. <br /> <br /> the good: some laughter, amazing identity of the killer, a cameo by Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene from LA MASACRE DE SLUMBER PARTY is used as a flashback. <br /> <br /> the bad: I was excited with this movie, I loved the three Slumber Party Massacre because they were so fun, and I expected a lot from this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with screaming tones", but They just sucked in. They exaggerated on "We're cheesy but proud" and basically we did soft porn but with a good "who did it". <br /> <br /> **
