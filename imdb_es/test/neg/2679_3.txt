Man, the 90s really were a horrible decade for movies. Movies lack a good style and stories are often lacking. <br /> <br /> This sixth entry to the long series of Halloween is certainly bad. You just never get into the story because it is not a very well constructed and developed film. <br /> <br /> It is simply a poorly made film, which also suffers from its non-image writing and its non-narration. Convincing characters found in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in this just for being in it. It's a real shame that this was the last role of Donald Pleasence. It's nice and also suitable for your last role to be in a Halloween movie, but it definitely deserves to be in a better one. <br /> <br /> There is never a real sense of danger in the film and the character of Michael Myers is never presented as threatening or frightening. Maybe it's because he's appeared too prominent in the whole movie, from very early on. He goes back to doing his usual things but without too much class or originality. Also, attempts to discover Myer's past do not really work, for the main reason that it just does not explain very well. It is obvious that the script went through several rewrites before, and also quite possibly during the filming. Several scenes were even re-recorded or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film looks and feels more often like one made for television. This is also due to the lack of good real blood. Basically, as a horror movie, basically everything is needed to make it good or even original. <br /> <br /> Until now, the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
