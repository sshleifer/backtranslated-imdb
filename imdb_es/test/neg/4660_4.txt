I saw this movie about six years ago and recently I did it again. If I remember correctly, I did not like it at all the first time and I appreciated it a little more this second time. <br /> <br /> This movie obviously has a big budget. The effects are mainly first class (except for one or two "hits") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, whoever has decided that Peter Stormare must act like a crazy Russian astronaut must be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is stupid, both with regard to the pronounced lines and the performance. So ... something must be wrong with the script. Instead, I would like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to see them. It is a total chaos that lasts more than thirty minutes with very few moments to catch your breath. In addition to this, the events that take place are simply not credible. I would like to see a much more sensible and reduced version of this part of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the scenes involving the flying space shuttles are too biased of action. The shuttles are maneuvering as if they were a pair of MIGs, at a safe distance of zero, as they bounce off ice blocks the size of a car like ping-pong balls. The director should see Apollo 13 to know the limitations of spaceships like these. <br /> <br /> I like the musical score because it is dramatic to a certain extent, which makes it very moving. The overall performance of the actors is excellent. Apart from the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With some minor changes, this would have been an 8/10 movie. I'm sorry it's not
