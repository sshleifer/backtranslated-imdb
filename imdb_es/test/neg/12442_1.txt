I could shit a better movie. This is a waste of time and money. It makes me sick that movies like these are really made and that the people who make them really think they are good. I like teen comedies, when they are well done. This film, however, takes this genre to a new low. With movies like this, people think that it's really okay to make this filth and ask the confident people to pay money so that they feel through it. It's sadism
