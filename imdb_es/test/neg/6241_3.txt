I wanted to like this movie, and there is certainly room for a psychological movie based on the character that does not go for cheap emotions. However, to enjoy a movie, it requires a credible plot, a bit of rhythm and editing, and a feeling of participation. In The Clearing, what begins as an intriguing mystery, with a kidnapping and unknown motives, becomes a slow and useless exercise. It does not really happen that much, and the so-called character-driven angles (as the director put it in his commentary) do not really add up much. <br /> <br /> Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does the best he can to try to outwit Willem Dafoe. Dafoe gives a little nuance to his character, to the extent that one can feel some sympathy towards him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe has been punished as a villain, he has gone to Christopher Walken's Typecasting Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character's entry into the movie was short and artificial, and I was wondering why she even bothered to present her character. By far the biggest loss of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's comment, all I heard was how fabulous her talent is. I agree, she is a great actress. So, why was it not used properly? Only towards the climax of this film can she show herself, but by then the viewer has stopped worrying. <br /> <br /> Pity, I liked some parts of this movie, but as another critic wrote, once In the middle of your way, you know that the movie is not going to get much better.
