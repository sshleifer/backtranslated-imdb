Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought that "stoner comedy" was just a way of describing more specifically a comedy in which a lot of grass is smoked and that people who look at it are more likely to enjoy it. "The grandmother's child", however, has decided that this is a complete niche and that drug addicts represent a piece of the comedy cake that must be achieved. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison gang were right, but that does not make "Grandma's Boy" less boring and not funny. They could be completely drugged, but most of the characters are half done. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, a longtime support player for Adam Sandler, first star) is a professional video game tester in the mid-30s. His roommate has evicted them. He could look for a new apartment, but then we do not have a movie. After trying a couple of friends, he ends up living with the good grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts from "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at 6 am and asks him to do homework and soon he is falling asleep at work and, therefore, the new sequel to the game might not end on the deadline. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by playing video games or drugging himself or both. Your friends / co-workers all do the same. Most of them are virgins who live at home in addition to video games. All are clumsy and all, with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only sometimes), his characters are not funny. It's funny if you're on fire ... of course, I suppose, but I can not say it from experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe all of us who are the losers are drugging ourselves, playing video games and uncomfortably looking at women with a specific style. Care in your breasts, but even so, it should not be the driving force of a full movie. Older women should not be drugged by accident (they saw one) or be one of the funniest sexual jokes, but that's what happens when a movie is not about anything. There are no conflicts until the last 20 minutes out of the slight problems of being out of the pot, Alex tries to the sexy girl (Linda Cardellini) like and the guys who struggle to finish their levels by the deadline of the game. <Br /> <br /> The characters can be the salvation of these meandering stoner movies, but apart from an adorable Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and the Joel Moore's ability to make robot noises. , there is little ingenuity of the characters. Covert is a common main character with no comic dimensions, his merchant friend Dante is an inept actor and a waste of time on the screen, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far out on the periphery that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> If you like movies over nothing and seeing them in a mental and bodily state that enhances that nothing, "Grandma's Boy" is probably just what you're looking for. Those who need a little more talent and ingenuity to participate in a comedy will not be affected. The most I can say about "Grandma's Boy" is that it can be seen despite its uselessness. It will not feel like a total waste of time, but you will want to have used drugs to be able to at least take advantage of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
