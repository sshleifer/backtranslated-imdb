If you are thinking of going to see this movie, my advice is: do not do it. <br /> <br /> For me, the film did not reach the level at all levels and was a reminder of how terrible the majority of the British (and Irish) are. the movies are. The forgettable gut is the best I can say. If I had been on TV, I would have gone to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this movie with a group of friends and, after reading the advances of the press, prepared to not be critical and, hopefully, spend 90 minutes. But, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> As a comedy was not funny, like a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. Like a totally incredible love story. Above all, as a piece of 'gloriously exaggerated' lacked style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to earn their money playing er ... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but apart from playing the east end gangsters and carrying the boys, Michael Caine leaves you cold? <br /> <br /> To be fair, some of my friends thought I was "fine", but if you leave, my advice is to take a few drinks (or puffs) in advance and leave your critical faculties closed at home. <br /> <br />
