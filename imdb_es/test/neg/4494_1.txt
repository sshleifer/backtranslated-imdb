This film serves all imaginable Greek stereotypes. In a particularly irritating scene, the magnate says "I'm just an ignorant peasant." As the grandson of the Greek peasant immigrants who transmitted a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I found this film despicable and hateful.
