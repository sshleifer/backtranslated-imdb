Oh Good. Pain. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie title on TV shows and I thought, "I must see this movie, scamming Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrible, but I hope it's ridiculous too." It sounds incredibly wrong. Well, I was almost right. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad and, sadly, not even without grace. It's just bad Worse still, it takes almost an hour to get to something resembling an action. For the first half of the film, we have to endure some foreign language murmured (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and a terrible performance, since a woman vomits live snakes for reasons we only discover later. Then we have to endure an even more terrible performance, and we discover that those who murmur in the foreign language could speak English anyway, since the snakes finally break loose on the train and things move from calm to ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Low budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. What we have here is a film that we have not thought about, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense of capitalizing on its very few strengths. I give him two points for a few decent special effects and a crazy ending, but I still find it a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you like: Stagknight, the remake of The Wicker Man, terrible CGI.
