The young Michael Dudikoff as the young Lord Greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on an island in the Pacific when he was an infant. But instead of being raised by the monkeys, it fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he had not heard that the war was over. And like the young Luke Skywalker, it turns out he fell into his hands and learned the fighting skills of a Ninja. <br /> <br /> Something good because they were separated and the little boy suffered a case of amnesia, but those fighting skills did not disappear. The orphan boy, now called Joe Armstrong, enlists in the Army and parks in the Philippines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe played by John Fujioka rescues himself and goes to work as a gardener on the planter's estate and the terrorist goes between Don Stewart with a cheesy accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> As these things happen, they all meet and Dudikoff solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the daughter of the commander of the bad guys in this Golan-Globus production. Charles Bronson was getting a bit long on the tooth and Golan-Globus needed a new star for his action films. Michael Dudikoff filled the account quite well and made enough movies for them, including several sequels of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> This movie is all action and Dudikoff sends the bad guys to a record pace. What he does not do, Steve James does his best imitation of Rambo and shows his considerable martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you. the history. But that's what the public that buys tickets does not care about. Dudikoff certainly looks splendid, stripped of his combat clothes. No wonder so many sequels have been made.
