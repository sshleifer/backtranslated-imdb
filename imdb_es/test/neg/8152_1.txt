Being (somewhat) an independent filmmaker, I really understand what these guys were trying to do and I think it's a good idea. On paper. In the 16 mm film, however, it is horrible. I did not realize that the thing was made in the mid-90s because the film was so grainy and bad that I could have sworn that this was one of those 30-year films in which a pornography producer tried to become the main actor . And the sound! Ugh, I do not know what kind of microphone they were using to record, but it seems that someone is walking on dead leaves throughout the whole thing. I guess I should not judge too harshly, after all, how many feature films has MY company published? None, but I would like to think that at least we would have a good image and sound quality to accompany our bad performance, writing and direction. A + per idea, F-- per execution.
