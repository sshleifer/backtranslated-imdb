This was not a good movie! Why do people keep saying that? There is a nice little story and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where do they come from? Besides, what the hell? There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random types dominate ALL. Quickly too. It's not like there's a long fight scene with a lot of fighting. There were only three guys in the bar killing these vampires like a fat man who kills twinkies! The next thing you know is that Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech and leave the homeless in central Mexico. End of story. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple, which is fun because it would have to be southern Mexico, not the border. Why do people lie and tell people that this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or see this movie at a friend's house. You wish you had recovered that moment of your life.
