This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb, write some kind of review and, as often happens, it is not due to a really excellent movie, but to a really frightening one. <br /> <br /> Take the narrative style that the youngest can relate to the Max Payne videogame series, a cast of virtually untapped (which is not a bad thing in itself), poor dialogues, some dark scenes but not enough, and make a film of that Do not worry about the bad performance, the duration (too long), the lack of immersion (the main character must be one of the least interesting I've seen in a long time; I care less if he died.) or the often ridiculous solutions they find for certain problems in which the main character finds himself. <br /> <br /> I would not have written anything if it had not been for another revision here, giving it 10 stars. I gave him four, but maybe three is closer than I feel about it. Not only do I not want to see him again, but the mere fact of thinking about it brings me dangerously close to wanting to kill me. Oh, and a so-called black movie is nothing without a good soundtrack, it's not the case here. The final song seems to have been more suitable for a western movie. <br /> <br /> It's not romance, it's not action, it's not black, it's not good. That would be my comment if it were not for the minimum of 10 lines.
