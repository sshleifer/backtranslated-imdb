I heard that this movement was organized by a group of high school students. As an art project or high school theater, it's not that bad. Unless you lived near the milpitas in the seventies or you knew someone involved in the making of the movie, this is pretty horrible. Most of the actors are clearly not actors, but locals who volunteered. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features appears on KTVU in Oakland, but only for a minute). Some of the effects of the monsters are done with animation in motion and others with a man in a monster suit and each one works well on its own, but there is no continuity between the two. Seeing without dialogue, you would assume that the movie had 2 monsters. I guess the most untenable aspect is that even the main characters, who I assume are the children behind the movie, can not even pretend to act. These children must have been involved in the theater in some way to want to do this project, but they do not show any credible emotion in front of the camera.
