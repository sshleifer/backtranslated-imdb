I did not think this movie was very good at all. Basically they took a handful of phrases from several Shirley Temple movies, put them together and Orr acted as if Shirley Temple acted on the screen. "Oh my God!" It was said a good many times. If you are familiar with the Shirley Temple films, you will recognize several lines directly from your films. The problem is that they have Orr saying this in Shirley's daily life. In the end, what we get is a mix of recreated films from Shirley Temple, instead of a real look at the life of Shirley Temple. Save yourself the problem and rent the Shirley Temple movies, it's much better than watching Orr try to recreate Shirley's acting style.
