I am a German student, I am very sorry for the eventual errors (I am working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The very interesting stylist turned and with effective sound effects accentuated the disordered action of the drama, in no way from the horrible bad actors (movements and expressions of insincere and unnatural feelings) and make the relatively strange and meaningless story much better. Only the typical slasher genre in this case, very strange action. Many secondary interpretations partly destroy the main story and let the spectators reach the end in the dark, create oddities and let the senses of the actions and the merely murky point conjecture. I'm sure it's a hit for slasher fans, but not for me. But despite the fact that the interesting style of cinematography and the expert use of light is well developed. <br /> <br /> So it's not the best ...
