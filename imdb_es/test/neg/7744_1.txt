Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a smurf. <br /> <br /> And the talent of a shovel full of calcite. If you do not believe me, look at this: "Alien from L.A." Actually it's up to her to act throughout 9/10 of the movie! Sure, she ends up with a nice red bikini and a wraparound skirt near the end, but that's very little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls to the center of the earth to find him. On the way, you fall in love with a guy named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper, make your own jokes) and discover how "Mad Max" rejects life. Did you know that people who live in the depths of the earth have Australian accents? Me neither. <br /> <br /> It's bad (after all, it was MST'd) and it's also a Golan-Globus production, but after all that has been said, Ireland just seems to be lost, like it's trying to find where There are the photographers to be able to make a photo session. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> One star. And if you insist on seeing this, do it with the sound off and keep your eardrums.
