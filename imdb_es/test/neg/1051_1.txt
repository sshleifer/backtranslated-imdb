I loved that Reynolds told his lawyer: "Look, I've done a lot of shy things in my life, but I never killed anyone." Obviously, he forgot his career, which slid downhill after starting to make stupid movies like 'Cannonball Run'. Originally the Physical Evidence was supposed to be a sequel to 'The Jagged Edge' that Glen Close willingly rejected. The verdict is in, avoid physical evidence.
