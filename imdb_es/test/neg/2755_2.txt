This movie reminded me a lot of a Dead Kennedys song called "Straight A's". However, unlike this movie, the hero of the DK song becomes suicide. You wish that this bozo had resorted to committing suicide instead of committing the crime he committed. Everything was complicated and, at first, you sympathize with the hero of the movie, then he quickly shows you your sympathies. The long sequences of just showing the face of the hero while delivering a monologue drag the film quite a bit. Avoid this if possible.
