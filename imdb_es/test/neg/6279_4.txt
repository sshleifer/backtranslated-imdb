The war of the worlds of H.G. Wells, directed by director David Michael Latt, is a slightly below average movie, which is not so bad if you consider the budget you had to work with: only $ 1 million. For this budget, the value of the production was not so bad, the best part are the visual effects (I was very impressed with the CGI considering the budget) and the sound design. The less stellar parts of this film are the story that is VERY lengthy at best (but, once again, I think this is due to the budget they had, they had to prolong certain scenes to create the length of the feature film of 97 minutes). (Again it's because the actors did not have a story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots and music. However, again, I can let the negative parts go mostly just because this movie was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. Still, you should see it for the simple fact of seeing how a low-budget version of War of the Worlds can be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10
