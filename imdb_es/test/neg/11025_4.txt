I decided to watch this movie because I had never seen Carol Lombard in any movie. I'm sorry, it had to be this because, frankly, is this a dog? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is simple: try to include too quickly in a story about a young lawyer. (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What is that cliché? Get married in a hurry, repent as you want ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the worsening of the financial status of couples, their problems with John's mother, their struggles for paying. The bills, the diminished state of John in the office, the arrival of his son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with the mother), the anguish of the couples for their marriage, the illness of the baby that gets worse, what requires a heroic flight. by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John was accepted as a junior partner in the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many cliché situations could writers have? include? Maybe the mother dying shortly after? There was not much comedy; the drama was mediocre, at best; The dialogue was painful to listen to. Only the performance of the four main players was adequate. <br /> <br /> This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the United States coming out of its long recession? During which time many people experienced all the events described in the film? <br /> <br /> So, does it make sense that Selznick reaffirms American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and US initiative? ? All in the context of the "average" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And, it should be noted that the film premiered in early 1939; So, was it planned in 1938? Shortly after, the EE. UU they began to start production for the next Second World War. Therefore, this type of film was a great reinforcement for the general public; at that time, many of those who would soon have to join England in the war. As many here would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uncomfortable alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad I saw it. As a piece of sociopolitical propaganda disguised. But, I'll have to watch other Lombard films to get a better appreciation of their performance range. <br /> <br /> As another critic pointed out: see this one just to say that you have seen all of Stewart's films; Otherwise, do not bother.
