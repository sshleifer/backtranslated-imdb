Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut in "School of Rock" with Jack Black and her role as Megan in the show "Drake and Josh" and has become a favorite among fans of the Nickelodeon audience, so it's not a surprise that Dan Schneider would create a show just for her. Unfortunately, it ends up being as bad as, if not worse, "The Amanda Show." <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols in the high school community through a webcam program called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, played by the hilarious Jerry Trainor, known for his work on "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you this. Do not believe the 8.3 out of 10 that this program received because it is pathetic in almost all aspects. Dan Schneider probably spent about 5 minutes studying the interests of teenagers because all I see is that he says "iPod? IPhone? Home? Aha! Teenagers love anything that starts with 'i'! " and most of the concerts that were used in "Drake and Josh", if not, then they are really dry and forced jokes that do not even have a generous laugh, like "Do you want the AC to go up to 60 degrees?" "No We want you to raise it to 60 gherkins! " Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all the sets in the programs were used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified" that were simply spit and polished with random things to try to make them look different. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the program shows a transmission of the iCarly network is as terrible as the whole series. The dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which can be accepted by some, since they are only two friends playing in front of a camera, but what is the problem with the really strange and humorless antics that they do as "Random Dancing!" ? And it only gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best, by far. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is not believable at times, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous skill of Jerry Trainor, who fits very well in his role as "big brother protector" and his open-mouthed performance can lead to some very funny segments. Too bad they are not frequent, because, in my opinion, that could have given the show an extra star. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have done this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove his own cable. the playground to jump and throw jokes without grace and pathetic lines of cue-card in all directions, because everyone else has an exceptional talent buried under the wrong script and acting without weight. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh", so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is a failure. Jerry Trainor's performance saved this program from a rating of 1 out of 10, but he alone can not prevent "iCarly" from being as horrible as it is.
