Some disappointment Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union boss of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the business dies when an elevator is triggered and sinks twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the pit, in the most terrifying scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> Cobb does not know it, or does not know it. Do not notice, but the man behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the business of union organizers. <br /> <br /> Then, Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join. His father in the management of a cleaning shop. He is in shock, in shock! - to know that Boone has been hitting union members and killing some that have become hopelessly irritating. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of Boone thugs, led by Wesley. Addy. Lodge leaves behind a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews, understandably and with pleasure, takes care. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for his self-deception, Addy and Boone get their just desserts and Mathews winds. with the succulent Scala, which gives its name to an opera house. <br /> <br /> There is no brightness in any dialog line. They stole a couple of lines literally from "On the Waterfront" - "gunmen", "you will speak directly to the grave". The plot is schematic and contains absolutely no surprise. Vincent Sherman's address is pedestrianized. The picture is flat and uninspired, although there are a couple of good pictures of the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him because Johnny Friendly repeats "On the Waterfront", only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, in a minor part, does a good job. Gia Scala hits her marks, says what the script demands and does what the director tells her to do. An impressive woman, her life soured from the beginning. The director and the photographer do a good job with Wesley Addy. His hair is white, his face is bleached, his eyes are the color of a glacial lake, and sometimes he is shot through a wide-angle lens that turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of some kind of parasitic fish. Although I do not see him as a low-level muscular man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable person, although he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, than is natural. Nobody else in anything that looks like an important part is more than mediocre, and some artists do not even exceed that limit. Kerwin Mathews can be a good guy in real life, but he is extremely sterile and belongs to domestic dramas on the evening television. <br /> <br /> Great title, suggestive of intrigue and shadows. Some good people in the cast. A potentially explosive exposure of a business that nobody knows much about but deals with in megabucks. <br /> <br /> And everything goes this way.
