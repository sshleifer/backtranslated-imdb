What do you do with all the material that does not make the final edition of a movie? You can leave it aside in case one day an expanded or extended version of a director is released. I could sell it as footage to use it in a part of another movie. You could simply put it in the trash. Or you can collect it, accumulating more and more of each movie you make and then use it to make another movie, without taking into account the coherence or any sense. Throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative in it and align a number of opportunities (no, excuses) to locate your waste cells. Excuse the absurdly absurd nature of the plot by framing everything in the mind of a horror film director and you have a horrible movie. All this can be done with a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will lose two hours of their life watching him. And then come here and try to warn others to leave. The entire chain of events is a great waste of time.
