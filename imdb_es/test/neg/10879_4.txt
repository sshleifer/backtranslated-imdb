First of all, just let me tell you this ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! <br /> <br /> If any of the other people who destroyed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their comments would have been very different. The fact that the characters continued to disappear each time the protagonist turned to look, should have been a clear draw. This movie was not considered a ghost story when it was rented in the video store, not even a clue, and that is the BIGGEST mistake that the studio that commercialized it committed. It was deliberate on his part not to market it as a ghost story to confuse him as if the main character was confused in trying to make sense of it. The problem with this is that they lost too many spectators; the ghosts seemed "too human and real" without any of the usual signs, images or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you are now seeing a ghost ... and that is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know that she is seeing ghosts and neither is the viewer. Do you understand now? While you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts, then you will understand the film and you will not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or flaws in the plot. <br /> <br /> I admit it, this said, it was not a good movie yet, but it was not as bad as for everyone else. Just understand, if you plan to see this movie, everything you see, "is not" always what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for the performance, 3 for the originality, 5 for the plot and 5 for the fear factor, although there were some bloody and scary moments. It's not a good movie yet, just misunderstood.
