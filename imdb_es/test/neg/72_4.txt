Oh my ... bad clothes, worse synthesizer music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80s are back with force in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, directed by the infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and the short career director (thank God for the small miracles) the direction of Fabrizio Laurenti. Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (which was dubbed "The House" in that place), Witchery offers some modest goodies and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film jumps from one scene without another, without allowing some seriously wooden actors and hilarious confusions day and night to slow their progress to the expected end , crowned by a serious surprise climax of WTF. (I love the expression on his face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few, very few scenes; unfortunately for him, these few flashes of the magic of the film fade quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> The positive sides are experienced when the gore hits the fanatic. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic style of latex and red paint of the 80's in Italo-gore, when things were 100% handmade and as surprisingly vivid as modest budgets allowed. I could only see with sadistic joy and few laughs all the exaggerated ways in which the obnoxious characters (and the actors) were destroyed and misused, one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently has not been allowed to try any role other than that of a good girl / woman in her career, or so it seems when she reviews her filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, friends: there's not much more to tell, let alone tell them at home. Do not expect too much when you spend a rainy afternoon with this, and you will probably experience at least some fun. It also helps if your little rotten heart beats to the bloody horror of the euro of the 80s. And speaking of hearts, all the films in which David Hasselhoff is skewered by a large metal object and bleed a lot in the room and the hallways, they MUST have one in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth, what? it's yours?
