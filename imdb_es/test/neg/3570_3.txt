I agree that the movie is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors who represent Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the real Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The film, based on its famous division, would have been better if the professional actors had interpreted the parts. Many films made during this period of time took advantage of the popularity of Big Bands. Most of the time, the films were not so good because the musicians are not actors of their trade. The majority of the audience that went to the movies did not go to see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey playing themselves; They went for the plot and the music. I've never been a big fan of Dorsey, but the music is good even today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post about the actors who played mom and pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as the Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Mrs. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper By The Dozen.
