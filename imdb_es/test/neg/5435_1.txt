Anyone who has seen the stinking, smelly piece of poop called Congo understands my title. And I'am sorry for you. This movie was not only bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? It is rumored that Julia Roberts got rid of you because this movie exploded so badly. Huge diamonds? The murderous gorillas? Speaking of gorillas? Hmmm It sounds like a blow! OH! The accent of Tim Curry is so bad in this movie that he would rather be deaf! I recommend this film to the bulimics who seek to purge after a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients who only need that reason more to die. If this is true to the book, I would say let's have it burn an old Footloose book and destroy each copy. If future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain it? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Do not look at it! Run away! DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM! If you think it is full of action, suspense or great effects, YOU ARE INCORRECT! If you think he blows more cock than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So, if you're still going to see Crapo ... I mean Congo, I say do it after you've just taken 50 Tylenol PM.
