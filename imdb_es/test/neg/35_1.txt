Maniratnam, who in India is often compared to leading filmmakers of the world and is considered a genius in the making of films, has shown once again that he can only make the frames look good visually, without offering much thought. Forget about pure cinematography The pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old art form. <br /> <br /> Although I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies that have been made all over the world, it is still very thoughtful. and an uneducated filmmaker can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenious plots, does not contain lingering effects afterwards and most contain a ridiculous ending and MUCH melodrama, seen profusely in Indian films. <br /> <br /> General, Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my dislike for his films once again. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those in this forum who claimed otherwise. My suggestion for you: SEE SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.
