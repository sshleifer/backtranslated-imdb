Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark makeup, is she supposed to be a witch? And I have the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is "different", someone that nobody understands ... She is just a teenager and a silly girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. Also, Brandi is very misunderstood or the character is made to be ... Fake. She did not convince me that I was not a witch, not that I would believe it in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts as if she is not entirely sure if she is a witch or not. And the way they dressed her up for the court: I see the old women every day who would not wear it, even if it was the last outfit of the world! Brandi's brother was not very convincing either ... But, you see, the important thing is that he "put that bad and bad girl back on the floor at the end of the movie". "She won the battle, showed everyone that she is different." <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, too superficial. I only saw it because there was nothing else on TV at the time, so I was condemned to this garbage. Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the rating of 7 stars, I almost fainted ... It does not deserve it, compared to other movies that are also rated with 7 stars.
