So unfortunately, my partner and I saw this! It was showing on a Sky channel here called "Zone Horror" that basically shows horror films from B movies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It was a boring Friday night, so I decided to laugh and take a look. Apart from the atrocious performance, the terrible plot, the terrible effects, the work of the camera of poor quality and brain numb of everything, it was fine, hahaha! In all seriousness, it was a great laugh to poke holes in her and laugh at the silly actors. There is a bit of half-nakedness that animated the film a bit, unfortunately it was the "uggo" who went topless when my partner calls her: oD If one night you get bored and this happens, you are playing, You might like it :)
