Jim Brown stars and produces a set of short stories in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. History makes the Japanese take prisoners from several men in the army, including some divers, whom they use to recover the gold that MacArthur had thrown into Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> It's a messy movie that aims to make a statement about war and Racism (The film uses the war of Edwin McCain in a not-so-subtle montage). The actions are adequate at best. Jim Brown is fine, but he does not really show any kind of range in a performance that simply has him standing upset. The sets are useful but they seem quite cheap. The film suffers from the beginning due to a large number of archive images that include many of the best known shots of the Japanese attack in Tora! Torah! Tora! The use of such a large budget sequence makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; It also reminds one that there are better movies out there that one might be watching. For me, the film seems to have half of a real plot, the recovery of silver and half of a plot that is there just to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting, even with the final explosive. <br /> <br /> Given the option, I would take a pass.
