Being a gay man who lived the period of time examined in this tedious documentary, he was eager to see how the subject was handled. Unfortunately, the filmmakers squandered what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only cares about the period within the city of New York, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a lot of time in New York City at the time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone during the 70s, and here they are again, increasing their nostalgic attitude and even pulling. The film should at least have tried to cover broader issues, such as race, aging, the growing gay caste system based on wealth, body image and the emergence of "clones", the discrimination of subgroups within of the community. and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). Unfortunately, we have none of this presented, and the memories of the interviewees are not different from my own memories. If you were there in that decade, you will enjoy the archive photos and the home movies of the bars and clubs that chased us. If you were not there, this movie will undoubtedly seem boring. It should have been much more, but unfortunately, it is not. Two stars to jog my memory ... I still miss going to the Anvil!
