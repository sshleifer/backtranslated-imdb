I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and Holy God was bad. From the script to the editing, acting and cinematography, none of that worked. Not to mention that the design of costumes and costumes were very annoying for the period of time (covers from the last 70 years to approximately 2006). Even John Hurt, who is usually an incredible actor, was too ridiculous. Granted, to begin with, Quinten Crisp is an exaggerated guy, but Hurt was not given anything to work with here. I do not know much more to say, except the audience I saw it with, I loved it ... so maybe it's just me. But audiences love film festivals when they're sitting next to the director and all the actors. It is not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought that this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was hilarious. Drunk and give it a shot when it's on HBO in 2 years, if it ever gets that far.
