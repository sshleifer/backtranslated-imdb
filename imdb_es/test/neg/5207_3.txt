I'm a big fan of terror, and I bought this movie because of all the hype I got in the forums. Well, let me tell you, I do not know who I was giving all the hype, but let me talk about some things. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is "no" many things. It is NOT scary, it has NO suspense, it is NOT excessively bloody, it is NOT too sick (except for one season maybe) it is NOT very well written down ... To all. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that a couple flees to a small island in Greece because they have done a bit of malice in London. We do not even know what they did, but it is presumed that they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler alert ** <br /> <br /> The male leader kills some people for their perversion of "cleaning the island of the perverts" quite strangely. The murders are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects stink. <br /> <br /> There is a part when he rapes a goat because his wife does not give him one in the morning, but even that is done without any care. For how it is fired. <br /> <br /> end of the spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is about the only thing that is not totally predictable. I especially enjoyed when the "pastor" threw himself at the husband. Anyway, if you can rent this and you have 2 hours to waste, go ahead. It's nothing better than a cheese sandwich processed into moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
