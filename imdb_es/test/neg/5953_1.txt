Horrible, horrible, horrible show. The "real world" issues dealt with a flagrant lack of originality. Stereotypes in abundance. What the hell is going on with the brows of African-Americans (blacks!)? Power Tyrone! Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible show. The fact that it lasted three seasons breeds belief. This show is really great for the brain who accept mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by the bell almost seemed humorous in comparison to this. Well, in retrospect, no. It is of the same banal kind and, therefore, equally lacks intelligence. The only thing missing so far is the message of Jesus is GOD. The mentality and liberation are the same, but somehow it feels evil and soulless. You can almost hear TV executives spouting buzzwords with each other. In fact, I felt so outraged by this, it shows an excrement of existence, I felt compelled to comment. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible, horrible show.
