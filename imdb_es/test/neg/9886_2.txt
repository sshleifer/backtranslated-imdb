The film blood and chocolate is NOT ANYTHING like the book. The plot has totally changed and whoever chose the cast needed to read the book. First the girl is not an introvert, Aden is. Vivian was the one who persecuted Aden. His mother must have survived and be the only one after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who committed all the murders along with Ralf, a former Vivian. Gabriel is not old. He is old And Aden did NOT get Vivian in the end, Gabriel did it. The title came from Vivian comparing kisses of Aden (sweet as chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious as blood). She collected blood because she promised more and he understood her more. That reminds me that Gabriel is not against humans like in the movie. He simply avoids intimacy with them because they hurt him in the past. Actually the book is incredibly better than the movie. But if you want to see run, a montage of appointments and many jumps. Then this is the movie to watch.
