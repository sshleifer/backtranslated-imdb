The use of blue-black and vibrant skin tone movies to create a feeling of noir-ish to this movie unfortunately does not work. In fact, it is quite annoying, since it obscures the demonic characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. <br /> <br /> At least the original had a hysterical energy and the pieces of blood were quite impressive. Black blood is not terrifying, nor is the main female demon scared at all in its attempts to growl and snarl on the screen in its best camp style of Lugosi. 'Nude lunch', directed by Russ Meyer, you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise give this movie a wide circumference. The fans of Bava and Argento, once again, are bitterly disappointed.
