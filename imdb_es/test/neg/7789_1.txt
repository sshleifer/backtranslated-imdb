This was only the second version of the classic Charles Dickens story he had seen, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film begins with a quick live action piece in which Simon Callow, like Charles Dickens, begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then, obviously, goes into the animated story itself. You probably already know, Ebenezer Scrooge is the bad-tempered businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage), who warns him of visits from the other three ghosts of past Christmases (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent future / to come. After all this, he obviously realizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be more pleasant in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), the ex-lover of Scrooge Belle (Kate Winslet) who needed to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of the Christmas gift showing the Two children "want" and "ignorance", Scrooge is still harassed after being nice, and worries that he can not keep his promise to remain kind. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew, Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not of high quality, the actors have squandered their voices on a piece of worthless garbage. The only good thing that comes from this movie is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the closing song "What If", and for the rest, it is simply frighteningly horrible. Very poor!
