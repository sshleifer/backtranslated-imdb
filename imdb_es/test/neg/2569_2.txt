Wow, I have not seen such a bad movie since "Fire Down Below". Wait, that's a Seagal movie too. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below," Seagal focuses the film around his message of environmental awareness and how the military, the FBI and the CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to any social comment that Sea Gal is trying to convey.
