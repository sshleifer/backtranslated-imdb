After seeing PURELY BELTER, I went to this site to review it, but not only because I also had to consult the curriculum of the writer / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared in the opening credits, I knew he had seen his name somewhere and, after checking it out, I discovered that he wrote and directed the film version of LITTLE VOICE, one of the most underrated British films of the 1990s. . <br /> <br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different fish kettle. It is a grim stereotyped view of Geordie's life and very ungracious. Everyone is either a wife beater, a single mother, a thief, a drunkard or a drug addict. Since many scenes are developed in a school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic bully and that is as close as the movie comes to reality. Oh, and everyone has a very nasty mouth, which adds to the grim unpleasant atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I did not really like PURELY BELTER as I watched and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like it even less . With LITTLE VOICE, Herman proved that you can make a fun uplifting comedy with souls from the north, but I had to ask where his undoubted talent was in this movie.
