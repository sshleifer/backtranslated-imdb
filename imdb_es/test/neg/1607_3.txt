Not only did I read the book and saw the movie, but it was on the USS John F. Kennedy when they filmed this. It goes without saying that film crews and actors may be trying to get people to do their job. Now, about the movie. As a Navy professional, I was very upset about the way they showed life on board an aircraft carrier. I could decipher the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone who has lived in a provider could), but that would take pages. One scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and they were watching a RADAR movement on the screen. Every time the contact moved, it sounded. Unfortunately, that team does not emit a beep like that (I was a technician on that team). The book was based on a fact, the movie was not. The follow-up on the television series was so bad and the Navy finally realized that supporting this series would only make them look bad. If you are a Navy person, look at this to see what a movie about the life of the bearer looks like from the eyes of Hollywood. If you're not a Navy person, look at Midway or Top Gun, at least those movies are entertaining and fact-based.
