The creation of Brodzki is a great example of how NOT to make a film. First there was a book written with great humor. Book that has many fans who would be happy to provide help when the producers, for some reason, decided to employ people who barely heard about the book in the first place. Then came a script without humor and full of nonsense as possible. At the same time, the script was written so that only those who actually read the books understood something of the plot. Not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway (for example, "I'm like a piece of ice, you can burn yourself," Yennefer said as a warning: warning that logic is something that this movie lacks). To add to that, we must mention that no matter how much money was supposedly spent on the film, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes seem taken from a really poor theater. That is the best aspect in this way. And to add to that, we have some 'naked scenes' put there just to be in the movie because they have no explanation on what one can call a plot. The film has only one force that can hardly compensate for the rest: music is not bad. Although if I had to choose I would prefer to have it separately. It sounds better if you do not have to see this failure of the overproduction.
