When this movie was made in 1980, I was a teenager at football stalls playing as part of the audience. This was done in Mooseheart, Illinois. The large letters that spell "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered with a banner in the movie. The director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was done. The St. Charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, although I think it may have closed recently. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Right below them, you can see the head of my sister Noel (she was 11 years old at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of his head, but when I saw it on TV in 1981, I could see his whole head and also my sister Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was fine for a movie made for television. As there is already a description of the movie here, I do not need to repeat it. It's worth seeing at least once.
