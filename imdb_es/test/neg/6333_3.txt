The nasty "home invasion" goes back to Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" version, with such nasty shots as "I Spit On Your Grave", "Wrong Way" and "The Visitors" shortly after. In the footsteps of that movie. Here, in the early 80's, the Italian offer is regurgitated once again, with the turn that it is in a continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express"? It starts surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes get worse, as the sex scenes begin to gain priority over the most serious action and the suspense. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three rich young people who wallow in terrorizing and humiliating others, board a trans-continental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including the prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) who travels on the train frequently and has reached an agreement with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp, persuading male passengers to that they withdraw their money. A night of passion in your sleeping compartment. The three cretins quickly began to annoy the passengers with their aggressive and intoxicating behavior, but things get more serious when they take control of a full car on the express and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Very soon, they are delighting in their temporal control. a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the young men in a narrow compartment; Juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault; and later, the odious trio forces male passengers to play a die to decide which one to rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a doubly insipid concept for the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems to be prepared to defend himself is a convict escorted to Germany, but what hope does a man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto has a decent start. Several intriguing characters are presented, and it is shown that the three thugs have a truly unsettling influence on travelers. Although the story is clearly a matter of exploitation, the initial scenes are carefully constructed and the film seems to rise above the usual level of its genre. Things fall apart during a horrible scene in which Kerova is sandwiched by sex in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs. The scene is filmed in a boastful way and the effect does not seem to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators. instead, we are asked to feel energized. This is sensationalism at its worst. More humiliating violations follow, but the rape sequences involve too much prolonged camera work on oral sex acts and the female genitalia. A sequence that presents the 16-year-old girl is on the edge of the hard core and feels particularly "wrong". At the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it's easy to forget that it was thought of as a thriller, since the last hour of the film is dedicated to pornography instead of suspense. The lovers of the bad death will delight in it; others may want to look elsewhere.
