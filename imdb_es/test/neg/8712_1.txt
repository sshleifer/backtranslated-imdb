I almost fell asleep during a screening of this. From a boring story that seems to last forever, continues several days in the life of a prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can not be together and how they should go their separate ways. <br /> <br /> The male prostitute then goes in a downward spiral and self-destructive trying to find his "only true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signals on where to place his love . <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he hooks up with an ugly guy (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay pastor, and a guy who ends up having a "three-second sex session" with him in an alleyway. <br /> <br /> Never stop Surprise me how movies STILL depict random sex as scenes that can happen in a matter of seconds, as in this case where the trick just has the pants unbuttoned before pushing three times and experiencing miraculously the orgasm. <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards his phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a brief side plot that involves the main characters visiting their busy mother who seems to have no time for her lifestyle. There is also another brief side plot that involves a random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from his window. And there is also a brief side story in which the letter is shown to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not informed of their relationship with this person. <br /> <br /> None of these things really connect with each other, just to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. It seems to be living life as a ghost. There was a good scene in the whole movie that involved him rummaging through a garage sale in search of a particular record with the saddest song in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie seems to continue forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem like a dream, but sitting in the theater for almost two hours watching this nonsense will seem like something more like a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The ending seemed confusing to me, since I was not. Are you not sure if the young man died and went to heaven? That would have been a good reward to end the misery that both the audience and the main character had to endure in this senseless trip. But, since it is an "independent film", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those of you looking for nudity, there are only short scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive is artistically hidden in the shadows. In other words, do not waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2 of 10
