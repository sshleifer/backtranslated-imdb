"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the "Fellini Satyricon" of 1970 with strange sights, monstrosity and depictions of sexual excesses, all in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini is not ... First of all, it's not that entertaining. Too much screen time is devoted to the McDowell with insect eyes and with the rubber face on the titular paper. His acting is too complicated to be convincing. The performances of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more persuasive and credible, the latter being the most nuanced. The relief could have been provided judiciously by the development of the surrounding characters more completely. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. An example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has a tremendous presence on the screen in an important role, but in general is left in the background. The only positive characteristics to accredit are the skilful use of some of Prokofiev and Stravinsky's themes in the musical score and the inclusion of some of the unpleasant but, nevertheless, precise actions of the despot. However, these two factors are much less than those necessary to alleviate the prevailing tedium.
