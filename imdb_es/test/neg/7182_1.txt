Another example that we should avoid making spectacular action movies in Sweden, does not work, except for Widerbergs, which is still unsurpassed, MANNEN PÃ…TAKET. Stormare does the best he can, I suppose, and some scenes are slightly effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is kidnapped? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his part of Bad Guy was very subscribed. I am constantly surprised that relatively large Swedish films like this are made without a sensible and functional script. 1 out of 5
