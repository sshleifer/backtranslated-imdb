As the other comments say, this could come as a surprise to those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But if you've already seen Delicatessen, there's nothing new in this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie is too late to be of any interest. I do not think it's a movie worse than Delicatessen, but it's a bore to watch it now, as it would probably be to see Delicatessen again. There's really no point in the movie, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant similarity with Kusturica's films, but it's really in a different league, so you should go watch your movies before you waste your time in Tuvalu.
