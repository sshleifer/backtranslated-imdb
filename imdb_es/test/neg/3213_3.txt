The smart marketer is he, Jess Franco, naturally, also took advantage of the huge temporary success of the psychedelic spy films as the sensational "Danger: Diabolik!" From Mario Bava. Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, since he could freely insert both sleazy, kitsch landscapes and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he would like. And he partially understood it very well, since "The girl from Rio" revolves around an organization that hates men, led by a fashionable dress lesbo, which plans to turn all men into obedient slaves. Unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans come into conflict with the daily affairs of a feared crime syndicate chief, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, but this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, since the action is quite docile. The movie is also very colorful ... but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There is a bit of nudity, of course, but very little in accordance with Franco's normal standards. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or expected) were more perverted nuances or frantic themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget, as usual, to work with, and I must say he spends that money well on more convincing pieces and talented cast members. In particular, the veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players that have appeared in a Franco production. Too bad that he can not save "The Girl from Rio" from being a big disappointment. A legendary Euro-Smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
