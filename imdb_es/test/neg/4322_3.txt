SPOILER FORWARD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) goes loose in a New England university town in search of a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess Ananka. Bored, slow (even at 65 minutes, he moves slower than the mummy!), He acted indistinctly, but the end is worth waiting for. The mummy stays with the girl (!!!!!) and she ages quickly while the two slowly sink into a swamp. This is (I think) the only time in a Universal Monster movie that the monster got the girl. Apart from that, this is a strictly amateur night. Probably the worst sequel to the mummy, and that's saying something!
