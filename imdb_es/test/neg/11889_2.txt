That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need more reminders of America's obsession with the creed of greed? The subject has become so politically charged that many viewers not only will not be entertained with movies of this type, but will respond with a barely concealed fury. It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and breaking it into a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What is really annoying with this type of movie, including "Purpose", is its claim that behind the brightness, there is a meaningful message that makes the movie worthwhile. In "Purpose", I did not find such a meaningful message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseous in their brilliance, do very little real work. Instead, they celebrate, play golf, show their coolness, sound "trendy" with a dialogue that comes directly from MTV-culture-talk: "rock my world" and "Now go back to the party, that's an order " John is presumptuous, self-important, superficial and smiles a lot. Robert, who wears small, modern glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film includes two young garage geeks, who look and sound like they came out of the movie "Antimonopoly" (2001). The stereotypes are reproduced for what they are worth, and this movie also includes sleek-looking computers and Barbie doll chicks for the occasions when our future billionaires can relax after all that heavy party. And with the images and the limited time dialogue that a story of this kind requires, can you imagine what date this movie will have in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> The best thing I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is Let's say it has a nice aerial view of San Francisco. The movie would have been much more pleasurable, much more entertaining, if they had abandoned these obnoxious characters and that repulsive story, and they would simply have taken us to the spectators on that little plane for the duration of the movie.
