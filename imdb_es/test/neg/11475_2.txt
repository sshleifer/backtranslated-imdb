This movie is not one of those films so bad that you get angry and angry because it seems to be so crazy and yet it's not entirely funny. It's just that there's nothing of interest in this movie. There are no real jokes that make him have fun, they only observe him for 80 minutes and then turn it off. I bought this on a very economical DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This is not one of those movies that is so bad that you can see it with friends when you get drunk and laugh. I did not hate it like I hate some movies, but it's pretty boring and it's not worth investing in them. <br /> <br /> The only people who voted 10 in the votes for this film must have been connected in some way because I can not imagine someone who really likes this movie, apart from the little children who spend their time
