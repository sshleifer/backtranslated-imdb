Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rima with kicks!), A karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, its creators looking to detonate it and destroy a rival company. Along the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd appear to displace the duo, while Jack Palance is there to provide guidance to the duo in the race. One of the things that is quite impressive about the Cyborg franchise, is how the series has managed to have actors quite prolific and offside in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Do not you know her? Well, she was in a group of pornos from the 70s). This has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcolm McDowell. (Okay, the cast of Cyborg 3 is not that impressive). I have never seen Cyborg 3, but I did see it on the science fiction channel and I must admit that it did not impress me. Actually, Cyborg 2 is a film that often has a charming look, is shot with excellent style and the visual details make it easy for the eye. However, Cyborg 1 was the same way, in fact, the film was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made everything easy for the eye. Unfortunately, like the first one, it has no new ideas or anything like a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so, for various reasons, the film does not have much to offer beyond its appearance. Another aspect is the terrible performance. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance go well, but seriously Palance is playing with a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I suppose on the positive side you can not accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with the casting. Still, the movie is boring and, on the one hand, I lost interest in the story fifteen minutes later. Also, why did they link him to Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which manages to be worse than. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
