Well, ten years have passed since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved a bit, again, as the other comments did, the Australian filmmakers should have a bit more drama instead of the Australians of middle class who ride beautiful places on bicycles. There was not much in the dialogue. The middle class is not funny or rich. There is also a cast mix. Why is a young woman going to marry a man who is old enough to be his father? It escapes me. This movie is a shame, it seems like a wonderful place to spend your vacations. Anyway it is one hour and thirty minutes of my life that I will never be able to return. Short lives to watch this movie.
