The selection of the bloated, bored and racist "Cimarron" ranks as the worst option for the Best Film in the history of the Oscar. Of bad performance (particularly by the justly forgotten Richard Dix, whose performance as Yancey Cravat, an egocentric and irresponsible, ranks as one of the most narcissistic characterizations in the history of the screen) and pioneer, the film is truly shocking due to the Racist tendency towards is a black character, who shows up when he is shown sleeping on a spider. <br /> <br /> Other comments from IMDb critics have dismissed the attitude towards this character as being merely dated, but many films that appeared during this period did NOT represent blacks as shufflers, lazy mentally retarded way in which this giant delights a lot; So that argument seems weak to say the least. But whether you consider this degrading characterization as a surprisingly bad taste for someone at any time or simply the forgivable ignorance of a less educated age, it is very painful to see it with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even This might not matter if the movie was not as boring as it is. Voted as the Oscar for Best Film at the 1930/31 Academy Awards when classics such as "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" were not nominated, "Cimarron" is by far the worst selection to join the pantheon of the Oscars.
