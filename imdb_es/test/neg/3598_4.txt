When I found out they were doing this, I felt happy because the first movie was quite good, although a bit small. <br /> <br /> But then I remembered some of the disasters of the Disney sequel that I've seen previously (Im looking at you Little Mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway I saw it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. Best of all, the animation is excellent. It really has that special brightness that Disney's "right" films have. <br /> <br /> Apart from that ... the rest is disappointing. The plot is seriously all over the place. One moment is about something, then it completely changes to another story and then changes to another completely different story. It reminded me how the Family Guy movie was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed maybe once a maximum. Kronk was very funny in the original movie, but this is not fun at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, unless someone gives it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
