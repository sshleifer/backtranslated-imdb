No blood, no blood, no rewarding death scenes ... silly fool silly fool. Dear God sitting through this movie made me sick. Ill sick sick Very boring ... extremely boring ... <br /> <br /> There is not a humorous aspect of this movie! I can not find anything good to say about it, other than that the leader had a good body ... I suppose. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
