How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking ghost tour, one can take in any southern city. The appointments were generously reduced without the first effort to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified. <br /> <br /> Reference was made to the documents without having been produced in any way. The fraudulent plans showing vintage films were spliced ​​aside from reels of historical films without separation from reality and self-promotion. Film scrolls were dropped that were completely unrealistic and unlikely for the time in question, as if we were trying to imitate Blair Witch, hoping to hoard a house of ghosts in what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. <br /> <br /> Is not this somehow a lack of respect for the real victims of tuberculosis, a dance in their collective graves for commercialism? The line between the actual footage and the manufactured self-service is very thin; the drips of doubt so insignificantly reduced; the scientific limits so blatantly ignored ... how could this figure in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> It is a holiday promotion, and to the extent that it is successful. <br /> <br /> Hell, I would visit the joint if I could locate it in Google Earth. It's not scary said a previous poster. Nor is it too serious, he says. Fascinating story Enbleable movie.
