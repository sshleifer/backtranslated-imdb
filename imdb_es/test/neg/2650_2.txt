To quote the criticism of a critic of the film, "it started slowly and stopped". The plot was credible enough (although some of the actions of the characters seemed very, very RANDOM), the script was pretty well written (in the sense that the dialogue did not seem forced), but everything was too slow. There were too many pauses between lines, and the way the lines were delivered was not as good. This movie had potential, but it blew her up like a teenager who resorts to drugs. My advice? Wait until it's on TV before you see it.
