Unlike what a critic said, this is NOT a Magnum Force scam. In that one, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook gathered his own squad of rookies from the Academy to dispatch the recidivists. In Extreme Justice this operation has the sanction of the high police commanders of Los Angeles. What they question to what extent sanction the exact methods used. <br /> <br /> This squad of special investigations seems to be a haven for the misfits of the Los Angeles Police Department, who have forgotten that their first duty is protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn believes that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his share of internal issues in the excessive use of force, is perfect for the squad. <br /> <br /> What should have sent him running from Phillips is the fact that he has a good personal relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. That certainly threw me into this movie, you would think Lou would be the last man he would try to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And what your team is, is a death squad. They address the perpetrators, follow them and wait to catch them on the spot. Then it's the open season. <br /> <br /> Extreme Justice was very exaggerated in trying to make a point. Surely there would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and take them outside. No civilian was injured when the citizens of Coffeyville did that to the Daltons. Or wait until three rapists finish work before moving. That is what they were asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And, frankly, I could not buy it. Many good players are really wasted in this.
