Thank God I was not operating heavy machinery, it could have been an even worse disaster. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, equal shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. The story line was pretty empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random shots of landscapes just to include them did not really add much. There were more shots of Arbor traveling in his car than anything else. The direction really did not take us to any of the scenes and neither did I feel for any of the characters. I would have qualified a zero if IMDb had the option. Great sedative if you can not sleep. It was 2 hours of my life that I will never go back.
