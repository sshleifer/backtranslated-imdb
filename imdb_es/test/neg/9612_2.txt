I will not be too hard with this program because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, it's just a girl named Casey who is trying to deal with a new stepbrother, Derek, and his noisy, raw family, while gradually imposing his princess standards on each of them. <br /> <In season 1, the story was really interesting. Back then I liked Casey because he was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was educated and profound. I felt bad when her new stepsister was harassing her at her new school. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she dated a nice guy, who now introduces herself as one of Derek's idiot friends. The season captured the real tension that the title of the program was trying to capture. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not say that the program has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but I encouraged Derek now. Instead of Casey. Now, there is little interaction, if any, between the two brothers. If they interact, it's only briefly. Oh, and I do not want any Dasey fans in my face. People, that's called INCEST, even if they're stepbrothers. My tolerance can only go very far, but that is not the point. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as an antagonist, has become more sensitive with the passage of time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unpleasant than before. I like how younger children get more time outdoors, but parents are even more clueless than before. But that is not the biggest problem ... Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with scant and nauseating background music. She has become more stupid and more superficial with time. In one episode, she complained and wanted her boyfriend to be more gentlemanly, so he purposely threw the food and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to being a strong and independent feminist? I have not seen much of the fourth season, but I heard that she is dating a guy named Truman, who is an imbecile and arrogant. Oh, I remember that fencing episode. She constantly reminds him that he does not like it, he is afraid that he "ties" a sword and, in the end, gets hooked with him because she can "handle it". What the hell? Why go with a boy like that in the first place? The first season that Casey had hit him on his ... it does not matter. Or, maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh, and she is a cheerleader. Not that it's a bad thing, but I think he fell headlong into one of his practices. And in a graduation episode, she cried because she could not find the "dress in her dreams" and was not completely satisfied until she became a dance queen. One thing I've noticed is that no matter how bad Casey tries to tell us her life is, things almost always go her way in the end (she gets the man she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, everyone loves her , etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see that he has really matured. I do not see why a lot of people hate Sally. She looks good, and it's good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about instead of "playing on the field." He's also treating Edwin a little better, and he's a good brother to Marti. <br /> <br /> Actually, the show is regular, and I rate it as low because despite the development of the character, the character that I once admired has now become a "fashionable teen queen" that you can see in any place on television. But it was fine while it lasted.
