In general, I am an admirer of Jess Franco's filmmaking but, for some of these films, I really have a hard time understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason for existing. Like this sick puppy, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematic value, is badly made without any kind of plot and presents some of the most evil crook scenes ever captured in a movie. This is another dirty movie about women in prison where rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are a daily routine. The guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only becomes sexually aroused when he sees a girl having sex with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the whole movie, however, you really can not enjoy this view with all the perversion that happens. The most dubious aspects include a game of barbarian hunting (you can guess what it is), a duel to death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl who injects a needle around the nipple. Auch! Avoid this mess and you will save the hassle of taking TWO bathrooms to clean the dirt.
