If you can stand the enthusiasm, this movie will make you laugh out loud several times. He did it for me, at least. I will only mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shooting" of the "fish" "swimming". The sound that accompanies those shots is also great. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope it will be another day in the sun; Seeing him as "The great American hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and since then it has not been very visible. He seemed a bit depressed in this movie. Somebody give him a funny job in a good show, or something like that.
