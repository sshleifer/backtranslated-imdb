I saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a triple comedy headline for teenagers, along with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously, we were not looking for quality, but entertainment and jokes. In general, we got what we wanted, but Wild Roomies really stood out: for being horrible. <br /> <br /> First impression first, the cover: the cover of the Norwegian version showed the covered breasts and a lot of seemingly "crazy" roomies in the background; Bring pictures of semi-naked and drunken teenagers doing a lot of fun things, right? - The "crazy" of the cover did not even appear in the photo. And the funny things you suppose they're doing? - Absent too. <br /> <br /> This movie was labeled as comedy, which is a bit strange, since it's not even remotely funny. The drama of the relationship would be more precise. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is about a young couple who inherits a luxury home in Los Angeles, and are forced to get someone in the house to have money. These roommates eventually test both the patience and the relationship of the young couple because they are so "wild". The problem is that they are not. And here lies the problem with this film: the protagonist couple is so anal-retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. You will find yourself encouraging fans of the room in the middle of the movie. Add a mediocre performance, a boring dialogue and a boring address and you will get a movie that is best not seen. <br /> <br /> See something else.
