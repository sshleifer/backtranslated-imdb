How do two great actors give a piece of junk like this to moviegoers? My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that ANY film they star in MUST be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now the movie, probably the worst "thriller" I've ever seen. The actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a time interval of 1/2 hour (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a silly parody: apparently his partner was speechless and did not say a single word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a piece of meaningless shit. The film was drawn and without meaning, the only question was whether the hero would die or not. A truly strange part of the story: the family I was expecting seemed to continue for at least several days; The hero and the anti-hero seemed to take only one day. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of time
