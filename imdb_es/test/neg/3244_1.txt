I am ashamed to admit in public that I was once on the cover of this movie! This is an absolute reason why one should investigate the movie before seeing it! The 'creators' of this film have called us fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands. <br /> <br /> Based on the mythical powerful and reborn cobras of India, the story takes us to Sorrowful Walk. The university, with more than 40 actors (now seriously?) Is the goal of her old friend Manisha Koirala (who in her previous life was a cobra, but now she is a ghost!) And her pathetic, eternal and powerful boyfriend Cobra / killer machine, boyfriend Munish Kohli (who fortunately has not been seen since). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I vote to study for the next exam at school instead of this movie! Give him a pass if you are sane. If not ... then you probably enjoy it.
