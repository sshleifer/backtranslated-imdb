What does it have to do with drug addiction that attracts novice filmmakers to offer their own opinion on the subject? This subject has been made to death. Drug abuse is bad. We understand. Drug addiction is painful to watch. We also get that. But the somber theme does not give the filmmaker license to make a careless film. It is not necessary that each film be a Hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use Orson Wellesian's deep focus, but it is still a narrative film. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing black and white black targets, and this filmmaker is just being lazy when photographing scenes without contrast to the existing lighting: the subject is sufficiently dark without forcing it artificially with careless cinematography. And even documentary films have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director obviously over-directed her and took her life away from her performance. Addicts can live in the fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seems to exist outside the screen. The support players simply handed in their lines without creating real people. I'm sorry to be so hard, Debra, but some things are true if you want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better, but please, not another drug movie. :)
