Congratulations to Baxley's DP for making it look like a real movie, the first time it happens in this series (with the notable exception of the F / X scenes). However, when approaching film production values, he lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were very much in the "so bad that they are good" category of horrible cinematic entertainment. Can you argue that the "believers" were simply trying to make a generic action movie with prayer? There are so many times in the movie where they discard their own belief system to be annoying. If everything that happens is in accordance with the will of God and they are simply your instruments, of what people infected with the virus have as part of their plan, right? Apply that to every situation in which someone of faith does not submit to the will of God, and get a pretty hypocritical little movie from the director of 'Action Jackson'.
