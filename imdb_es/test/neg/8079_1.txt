When I saw this shit, it reminded me of the title of the film FIRE, which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I do not even know what to say, the performance exploded, the fire seemed really fake, Andy, the girls are not exactly supermodels. And finally, I do not know what they are complaining about. I own this damn movie. Yes. Happy birthday. Well, I suppose it could be worse. I could be seeing something behind. And to make matters worse, I have the whole set on DVD. Fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I need is the amazing tornado movie that I hear stinks balls. <br /> <br /> Well, until my next fucking movie
