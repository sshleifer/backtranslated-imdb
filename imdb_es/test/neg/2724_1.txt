I am the only one to notice that the "realism" of the nineteenth century ship is wrong. Actually, it is a fifteenth century, around 1620, if memory serves, because the "realistic" movie is the Mayflower, now, as far as I know, the Mayflower NEVER went to Australia or even tried a trip to Australia. I do not know who managed the R & D for this movie, but using Mayflower and hoping nobody will notice is a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the cover and on the DVD. I wonder how other people noticed this little mistake. Not to mention that the movie itself was just horrible, I would have expected something better from Sam Neill.
