Did someone notice? When Miss Brook was taking a bath, she left the water with a white bikini and, nevertheless, she had removed everything to join the cabin. This could have been a good movie without Miss Brooks' fake accent and a year on the island. Please, how is it that Kelly always looked clean and ready for a photo shoot on FM. What started with the premise became mild pornography. And Billy Zane, come on, you can not be that hard for movie offers. when people took her away, why she mocked her face and after all that time did not feel like throwing up. I suggest to Billy that he find decent scripts, Kelly stuck to the photo sessions and the guy in the booth played Zorro's son in a future sequel.
