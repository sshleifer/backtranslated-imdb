Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels, all related to sex and melodrama, and some of them became movies, including this effort, and all have the distinction of being one of the worst movies ever made. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television for being ruthless and calculating everyone around him. He is a playboy of the worst type he uses and then shoots every woman who sleeps, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the IBC television network and when his young wife Judith takes a look at Robin, he does not he loses time in bed with him. Greg gets sick and has to take some time off. This is where Robin intervenes and begins to try to execute the network, but during all this, a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him commits suicide. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin using the moral clause in his contract when rumors begin to overflow on his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), who is a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Jack Haley Jr., who became a very successful producer in both television and films, but this was only his second film as a director, and the material he saw forced to deal seems to be well above his head. The script comes from Susann's novel and that's probably why it looks like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of the Dolls", and I think the reason why her books could never be translated well The film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking their stories seriously rather than tongue-in-cheek. With that, the laughter that arises from this is not intentional, especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the movie, which begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to the gay characters. Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely exaggerated and he has it using one of the worst beards in history and using the term "chic" in all other sentences. Law was not the original choice for the protagonist, but another actor who was chosen had a serious accident and Law intervened and offers one of the most wooden performances on this side of Miles O'Keeffe. The script of the film suffers in two different areas in that it is completely dumb and horribly boring and will test the patience of the viewers if they choose to watch this. One has to wonder what the result would be if a director decided to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is heavy and ridiculous.
