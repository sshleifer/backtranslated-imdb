This is Jonas Quastel's debut as a director and, to be honest, it shows. It seems that he released all the types of camera tricks he learned in film school to try to add some style to a poorly written script, which he helped write! The film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking in the Pacific Northwest for an airplane that crashed in which his daughter was and also a special machine that his company has built and also wants to recover. The first 5 minutes of the movie are fuzzy or shaky or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with these types of shots and they get tired very quickly. And there are also the POV shots that are to the right of "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the point of view (POV) of the Sasquatch. The editing is very choppy at times, since a scene seems to change right in the middle. I heard that this movie was filmed in about 12 days and I guess instead of "Starting over again," they restarted non-stop and edited the scene together. And the rest of the movie fades from one scene to another. There are so many scenes that vanish that I lost count. Now, the nude scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. You can easily see that it is a double body. And you know you're watching a bad "B" movie when in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, a hot girl decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And Sasquatch himself is not bad when you do not really see him and it's just a blurry image behind some trees or bushes, but when you finally see it in the end, of course, you're disappointed. First of all, he is not that tall. The actor who plays Sasquatch only has hairs on certain points of his body. It's a partial suit! And he's bald! I heard that a make-up person died during the filming and maybe that explains why the disguise seems done in a hurry. Some of the sound effects that come from the Sasquatch are no more than the roars of the familiar lion that we've all heard in other movies. I have to admit that Henriksen is not that bad. Yes, he is working with bad material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can improve certain moments of the film. People keep saying that a good Bigfoot movie has never been made, but I do not agree. I have always said that "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a jerk for a Sasquatch movie, but this is only for amateurs.
