Joe D'Amato could have made some other notable films in his very long and prolific career, of course, prolific, taking turns making VERY Z-grade movies in the great boom of Italian exploitation in the late 70's. 70, but Holocaust Porno It is not one of them, or at least it should not be. Of course, I should not expect much from a movie with such a title, but I thought considering the back of the box description that I might have some funny horror scenes with the "cannibal, mutant and horny zombie". It turns out that the zombie does not appear until more than half of the movie, and every turn we have a scene of lugubrious sex as hardcore as one can imagine. Which is right. But it's not very pleasant, except in the most "fuck" way. There is a laughable dialogue involving the lobsters that cost more with the mail order from Japan than in Paris, thin and attractive women play biologists and zoologists who have sexual complexes in particular (letting the door be unlocked to be raped, and a type of bipolar enjoyment of being attacked by the gang). <br /> <br /> Everything leads to the island, where the "main attraction" is a guy who from the beginning only spends an absolutely pathetic amount of time (forget about the ridiculous) just watching The newcomers to the vacant lots radioactive from the island of the shot to the Caribbean, and once revealed, they have a face like one of the guards in the palace of Jabba and they have a sweet potato as the main genital. But much more foolish than anything else is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has an excessive time to escape, but who sits there, with a blank face, while the monster brings gifts And for what. it must be a movement of racial exploitation on the part of the filmmakers that the monster ONLY violates and kills the white women, and not her. And it ends, of course, with a "happy" ending. I use appointments, of course, for a kind of shock that could have any kind of legitimate ending. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is NOT what you might expect, as it may be a bloody horror. Film with a lot of vulgar and attractive Italian monsters-zombies that devour human flesh. If something of what is violence in the film is done in a chain of shoes; a blow to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath, which is like the consequences of a tomato hitting someone. So, actually, the last part of the title is more directed to the market. However, even as a porn movie has little to follow, except as a reason for the cast and crew to have paid vacations in the Caribbean (as suggested by an interview with George Eastman, this was just one of the few quick phrases made on the island). He bought a penny with a camera job and other similar actors, full of genitals about 3/4 of all the time and with a miserable lip and music synchronization as Nino Rota forced at gunpoint to do something quick in a brothel , and it is STILL a piece of celluloid manure anyway; All this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it is not.
