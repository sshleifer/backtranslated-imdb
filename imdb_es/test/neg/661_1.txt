OK, let's start with the best. building. Although it is hard to believe that it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the frightful walls and strange objects found throughout were interesting. Other than that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> As for the bad, it's made by the WWE movies. WTF? Is that supposed to make you want to see it? In any case, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make films and allow Gregory Dark to direct it. bad selection. Previews in advance were more interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. Actors without talent and a disappointing and vague plot. Apparently many of the actors are from that "all saints" show. It's a wonder why I've never heard of them or their show. Apart from that, the bus driver, you never see, only he who closes the door, has had more action than almost all together. at least he handles tricks for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like watching scary movies, I really do it. but it exploded a lot, the whole audience was laughing at him and animating the characters in half. very annoying. The boy behind me screamed more during the previews of other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to watch, much less if you have to pay for it.
