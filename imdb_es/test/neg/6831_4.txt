Normally I am a Bruce Willis fan and, although he plays the cold-hearted professional killer, I consider him the most attractive character here. That said, his character makes a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible that he has not been caught before. The plot is thin to the point of being absurd. The ending was no less annoying and insulting because of the fact that it could have been predicted from the 20 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> ** the spoilers are still ** In Hollywood morale, the good ones always win, with a few casualties on the way, and the bad guys die, or at least they turn to justice at the end. The movie's awesome insult is the way our terrorist IRA, which has somehow become a cuddly and sensitive character, is going for a new life. Like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the biggest villain? The first terrorist (and, as far as we can say, unrepentant), or the hit man? I do not see much to choose between them --- in real life, or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
