When I voted, I was going to give a 2, but seeing that I had a bad look, I hit the nail in the head. The portrait of Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages worries me deeply. This is the third movie I've seen of D.w. griffiths where the races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways. Man is not capable of telling his side of the story, so I will try to avoid personally attacking Mr. Griffith. In my opinion, the three films probably influenced him thinking about millions of people and their children's children. Movies like this probably were due to many of the resentments that still remain with us. Some may say that the work of the camera was excellent and that the action was the first one at the time. The positive aspects are much higher than the negatives, it is as if someone took away $ 10 and returned a penny to compensate.
