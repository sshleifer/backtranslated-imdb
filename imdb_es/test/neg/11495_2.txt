I just saw Icon on DVD and, despite being a great book, the film is a weak substrate of it. Those responsible for the deed must be banished to Siberia. The reason why they mutilate the big story with all kinds of subplings of C movies that are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond my reach. <br /> <br /> However, the filmmakers and the cast do their best to do something with it, but in the end, the film was not satisfactory at all. <br /> <br /> Can someone make a decent movie to show how it's done? I'm sure the crowds will come together for such a masterful novel turned into a book, not a cheap C-movie.
