WAIT until you have seen most of the other films that have been released, wait a year, then look at this when you are ready for something with production values ​​so low that it will not challenge anyone's imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that whoever has qualified this film as a ten-star production must do so to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be strange. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her long hair for the short time that was presented to her, although she exaggerated the New York accent, but other times her Southern (Virginia and NC) accent was He slipped through. Ancient story for this successful actress who has grown a lot since this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I rented had two additional functions, a mini-bio section that only included Sandra's biography, taken literally from IMDb. I also had a quiz like a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you have them well!
