Heavy film of slow movement with a terrible performance in general, but beautiful places and clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a convincing job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voiceovers - What a fool! But Dalton is always worth seeing, even in bad films, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. It's worth watching this movie just to see it ... and it seems like it got into a romantic ten-cent novel, poor man. Your time would be better spent watching Mr. Dalton in the "Wuthering Heights" of the 70s or in the "Jane Eyre" version of the BBC in the early 80s. Poor Sela Ward, so charming, but so silly ... surely It has been better in other movies.
