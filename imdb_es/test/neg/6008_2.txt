Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I bought it at a rental store just to see another Emanuelle movie. Boy, did I make a mistake? <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is in this together with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but that is the only connection with Emanuelle. Here, Laura plays "Laura" (original, huh?) A beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. Beside her, she is a ** photographer of holes (a gaunt-looking Gabriele Tinti) and a blonde woman who is never called. Also living in Pia's mansion is Horatio (the sexy but silly Al Cliver), a mystic who speaks nothing but nonsense. Arriving for the weekend are Pia's two daughters, a lesbian with short hair and the other brunette. A lot of sex is implicit, but it's barely shown. A good actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who is lucky with three of the women in the mansion. Laura has sex with lesbians, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio in an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goat blood and is possessed during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rapes Laura. Everything happens with so little talent that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Far from being erotic, even the actors themselves seem bored during their sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Given that there were two famous couples in this movie (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is uncountable. . On the other hand, a film that offers a cast of Eurocult of first category and never delivers the products will annoy all the spectators, except the hardcore finalist Laura Gemser. Otherwise, stay away from EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
