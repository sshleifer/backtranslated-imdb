Okay, when you read this, YOU COULD have stopped crying. This movie was so horrible as to be quite annoying. The creatures are pretty cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment between the prisoners and their guard after being trapped on this island of Daffy. Even seeing Barbara Bach with all her hair disheveled was not a reward for buying this bit of poop. She walks in a whisper that I've never used, my voice before the breath that just does not wash when you're screaming bloody murder. (Hey, the protagonist was also cute, but I'm still not satisfied.) This is a scam of beer screams from the good island of Dr. Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson, who surely was born for better things, is just as bad as the bad guy. I mean, how bad can a BAD guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson) Joseph Cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers in his appearance. In the name of all that is sacred, do not rent this damn bomb.
