I'm going to fight here because this movie was so well shot and so well released that I'm twice as angry about its evolution as it is with a minor job. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can only say that the first part of my set of 2 VHS was a disconcerting and unbridled delight of strange but plausible plot developments. The main character was suitably naive, but also intelligent and very very open. The events with which he is forced to accept quickly are the separation of his parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots collide with a complete collapse of English society in the sixties, the dubious transformation of his father into the revered Buddha of the suburbs, and the fact that his cousin became a militant feminist when his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the growing punk movement in the seventies. Among other things. <br /> <br /> What made me angry was the amount of detailed work that each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part, only to turn everything into very bad porn episodes in the second part, too many to justify the development of the plot, and too explicit to even seem erotic. My biggest annoyance is when the directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their film, and for me it was a supreme example. <br /> <br /> I felt a little as if I had been invited to a party of very intelligent and funny strangers, only to have the doors closed and the guests not allowed to interact, and all of us forced to watch sex films of the seventies. What an insult to the hard work of these incredible actors! Why not make a cheeseball movie to begin with? And why choose a great main character who can really act, and then move away from him every time he is preparing for a great performance? I almost felt like he was also getting tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there pumping his pelvis for another actress naked and breathless. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Part One is a minor genius, Part Two is the perversion of the second level telenovela. I know the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these good actors were as exploited in real life as were their characters in the film, and I got angry and felt very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can achieve such a dubious degradation of the actors and the plot and make it look artistic. My suggestion is just to look at the first part, throw the second part into the proverbial garbage heap, and you will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
