I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if it has some kind of redemptive value, but Dead Space has nothing to trade! This is the kind of movie that will make you feel frustrated, restless and sick to your stomach. <br /> <br /> bad performance. Lick history Terrible effects. Horrible, unbearable dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
