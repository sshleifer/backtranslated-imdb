Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934), it was a decent movie, but I have some problems with this movie. First of all, I do not blame the actors of this movie at all, but more or less I have a problem with the script. Also, I understand that this movie was made in the 1930s and people were looking to escape reality, but the script made the character of Ann Sothern look weak. He kept coming and going between suitors and I felt that I should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character at the end. He really cared about her and her family and would have done anything for her and did it by handing it over to the fickle Neil Hamilton, who, in my opinion, was out just for a good time. The character of Paul Kelly, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) instead of Neil Hamilton, although she liked it a lot, did not see the depth of love he had for his character. The production values ​​were excellent, but the script could have used a bit of work.
