Being the science fiction fan that I am, I was always curious about this movie. So I was excited to see that Journey to the Far Side of the Sun was finally released on an affordable DVD (the previous print had been earning $ 100 on eBay, I'm sure those people would want their money back, but more than that in a second). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the premise of this movie (like "The Parallel" of Twilight Zone) is that there is an undiscovered planet that looks like Earth on the "other side of the sun" . This planet is, of course, exactly like ours, except that it is inverted. Basically, this means that your letters are inverted and people drive on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sound intriguing? Well, that's basically everything in this movie. The first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the trip to this other planet. Only tedious scenes of switches that are pressed, banal dialogues, etc. It does not make sense at all. Gerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actors in film history to play most of the roles. I mean, they're so boring that I'm surprised the team could stay awake to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, once the team lands FINALLY on the planet (after an endless stream of seated astronauts and literally, sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes notices that the copy is all upside down in a bottle of cologne and jump to another boat to tell people what you have discovered. Wow, he never gets to do it while he crashes and dies. The end! Oh, wait, there's an extra scene from one of the space executives throwing himself in the mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I guess he also wanted to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised that a movie like this could be made even in the 60s. Rent if necessary. DO NOT BUY.
