I saw this in a cheap DVD release with the title "The Entity Force". As I like the horror films of the 80s, I thought that I expected a real pleasure. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly boring and you are constantly waiting for something to happen. Eventually it gets something interesting, but this is in the last quarter of the movie. It is a case of too little too late. When the action occurs, it is not so good, what we get are corpses 'floating' on the ground and chasing the girls in the mausoleum. It's not the worst I've seen, but you can do much better. I would only recommend this to the horror collectors of the '80s.
