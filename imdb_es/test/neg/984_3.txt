I always think it would be good if I could somehow preview some of the old movies that were reissued on DVD before buying them. That way, you could save time, money and a certain degree of aggression when you feel so disappointed. <br /> <br /> "The Buddy Holly Story" is a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> I do not want to enter the characterizations, the gaps in the plot or the disorder with the historical facts that this film covers, because I had already reached an agreement with them twenty years ago, when I started to see it by first time. <br /> <br /> I had recorded it on the old Beta machine (Monaural) in the early 1980s, and I liked it so much that it became the players' favorite. The best part, in my opinion, was the performance of Gary Busey as the young Buddy, and his almost perfect voices and his way of playing the guitar. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for the day I could have it in ... STEREO ..., and that's where the disappointment comes in. <br /> <br /> This DVD version (supposedly) is re-recorded in audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it left me sadly disappointed and looking at my watch, wishing it would end. <br /> <br /> The sound is cloudy, bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it made me long for crystal clarity Voices of my old Beta tape! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of the images, the plot or the characters, the real draw card here is MUSIC ... and if you can not hear the main voices because they are drowned by the cymbals, or the backup harmonies, or other environments, then there is not much left, right? <br /> <br /> I'm going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for the following presentations, and I'll put it where it belongs, with the trash! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
