I really did not like this movie ~ !!!! It was boring and I was not very interested at all ... I am more an action girl, and I did not have NONE. I went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left ... but it was totally deceptive! Do not get this movie unless you like dessert and a lot of boredom. I really did not like the movie. It was not my style, but it could be yours ... you just have to see the previews or something, but it's my recommendation if you're a girl ... do not stay with this movie! This Scandinavian production is based on some of the observation strategies of Godfrey Reggio Koyaanisqatsi, which allows us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from intimate and broad points of view. This is not for me!
