Film title - Cake <br /> <br /> Review date - 5/26/02 <br /> <br /> Year of the film - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (barely), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo Rating - 4 skulls out of 10 <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain, a "marginalized", wants to be with the group "in", so he leaves his true friends and joins them ....... there is a lot of conversation annoyed with rich people. Acting <br /> <br /> ugh, I guess I got what I wanted because Dominique was fine, but man, the rest of the cast, apart from Brad Renfro, was bad or at least it was not interesting or pleasant at all. I know some might say that others were good because they made me hate them ... trust me ... I like nasty characters, but this group is unpleasant because they can not be bad people convincingly. <br /> <br /> She realizes that the only other people I got this for were hardly the same, and that's Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had was fine. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character, although small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly under the attack of horrible dialogues and very annoying characters. , that's enough violence! ok, there was a beating with a rock that was fine. <br /> <br /> T & A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> hahaha, they could not even add nudity to help spice up this movie, probably because nobody would want to put up with their body for this shit. If they are going to be exposed, they should do it in a movie in which they will be remembered as their character and not "oh, I heard that she gets naked in this one". <br /> <br /> General view of the movie (review) <br /> <br /> ok ok I know I am proud to be the person I like the most, if not almost all the movies, or at least find something good in it. Well, this movie is one of the few that I really fought to find something worthwhile. The problem with this movie is that it is very annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the attitudes of rich people and that did not help either. This whole movie really is, it's just a group of rich people sitting acting depressed and stupid. I can not emphasize enough the nuisance factor. This film tries to repeat the tried and true "group" plot, which can usually be done well with little difficulty. <br /> <br /> Why do not I have a picture of the movie or the cover of the box? Well, I felt that this movie did not deserve that glory, so I decided to put a picture of the reason why I rented it, and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I also courted her in Lolita and I thought she was so good that I decided to see her in any movie she performs. At least I keep my promises and yes, I've seen most of his films, except some hard to find. She herself is a great actress and would actively defend it, but she chooses some of the worst films to star in. Both this movie and Smokers are in the same boat of shit, but at least Smokers had a good idea for a story and even some really good scenes. <br /> <br /> Also the DVD box tries to trick you into thinking that this movie also has stars by putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the picture. If there's one thing that disgusts me, it's a movie that pastes the names of the stars in a box to make you think "wow it ___ I wonder how good ___ is in this ___ in that movie and I thought she was great!" Just to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2. Bijou actually had a part that semi meant something. Melanie, on the other hand, only has 2 lines about ... Of course, I do not like Melanie so much, but it's about ethics and not star. <br /> <br /> Of all this mess, despite the accessories I have to go to Brad Renfro to get a good performance together with Dominique. Brad can be a very messy child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason why this movie has skulls is because I got what I basically wanted: Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the additional pleasure of seeing the underestimated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more. So even though I was upset, I came away with some positive aspects, although this time it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> I recommend you ONLY see this if you have seen Lolita and you know how good Dominique is. or if you're an unconventional fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be very depressed. Also, if you're a fan of fucking movies like me, please do not assume this is a guilty pleasure because you'll feel guilty, for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> <br /> Some films are "so bad that they are good" as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (ignore it)". <br /> <br />
