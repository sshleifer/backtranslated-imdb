Good sir! This film should have a new classification on its cover: "Look only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!". I'm disappointed. I was expecting a good horror movie during the weekend ... I needed a rush of adrenaline and that incredible tingling sensation down my spine. But this movie did not do it. A reasonably good story but rather horrible acting, dialogue and filming. He was disconnected and, sometimes, completely silly. We had actors who looked in the wrong direction of the camera, people who spoke aloud (alone) and narrated what they felt and what was going to happen, equipment shadows in some shots, silly cliches like "I just need you to hold me" . "In totally wrong places and situations, thank you for allowing me to download and excuse me if I had offended someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
