It's not horrible, but it's a waste ... Lousy gags, bad music, bad drawings and animation ... <br /> <br /> As for the impressive number of animators and intervallists in this photo (from, hum .. a One hundred different studios around the world? Come on, how can you expect something coherent when you make a movie animated like this!) I wonder if a man in the credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, the 3D work is inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this movie) But the background is correct. The plot is quite silly, far from the accurate intelligence of the BD, and obviously aimed at an international audience. Distributing a movie around the world does not mean taking everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy ... A cultural object is much more interesting when it's challenging, even when it's a foreign film (in this case, being French)! It's even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some new things are working well (the Olaf character, sometimes, as with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, SMS, not even a verbal joke , just a stupid bird called a short message service: does anyone know imagination?). But, hey, it's an M6 / TPS production with something of Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​underemployed and Obelix talks too much. Goudurix could be great (as in the book) but it is too clear that he is a "great guy" who has a love story (with a female character not interesting). In fact, only the Vikings (with the exception of the wizard) are fun. Too much action, there are not enough laughs. The best part of the movie is the final credits. Not the music, but the few photos it contains. Style bd Well, definitely, Asterix is ​​not made to move!
