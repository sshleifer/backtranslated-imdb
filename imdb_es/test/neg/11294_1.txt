I fully understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an amazing movie, a spooky thriller with a magnificent story and a great jumping factor ... What I do not understand is why THIS movie was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to repeat his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and unsatisfactory film. <br /> <br /> There is no way to spoil the movie more than going to see it, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DO NOT READ. The movie is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore is not a problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to put your watch and leave the cinema exactly two hours in the movie, because until then, it's a very interesting thriller. The deal between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of the other characters are quite good. But literally at two o'clock, the film degrades into nothing more than a cheesy D-grade horror movie ... it's sick, and it's stupid and almost as if the team ran out of filming time, and they released a final in a day of filming. <br /> <br /> Initial comments about the unsatisfactory and quirky ending of Thomas Harris' book led director Ridley Scott to order a rewrite ... and, honestly, having seen the movie AND read the end of the book, No I know what is worse. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your money OR the time in this movie, unless you are prepared to leave EXACTLY at two hours, because that is the ONLY way you do it. I will feel satisfied with the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this, so great.
