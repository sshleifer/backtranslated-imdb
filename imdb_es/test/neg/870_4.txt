Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between the romantic that leads to suspense, anticipation and the charm of the plot. This story falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict, at least none that prevents the eventual union of the two main characters, so the suspense is flat, there is no anticipation and there is really no appeal at all. <br /> <br /> Chemistry Richard Gere and Diane Lane are representatives of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two actors in particular, I was quite surprised. During the film, I expected them to play a game of checkers and chats about the weather instead of seeing some touching passion. <br /> <br /> Although I am a fan of both actors, I think the casting in this movie was off, or maybe the address was off base and impacted their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which could also have impacted the performances; Without a doubt, the script could have needed the help of some writers of Harlequin who have real experience in putting heat into romance. <br /> <br /> It may be worth watching this movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
