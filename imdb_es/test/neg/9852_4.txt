The television program moved slowly and the "unconventional" characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fast forward could I spend the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The article indicates that it is a kind of comedy / mystery but I did not see much of either. <br /> <br /> If you really recover after the first 2 hours, let me know, because I doubt you see the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> This review is supposed to be without spoilers, so I will continue vaguely and without a spoiler. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unfriendly. I found myself asking 'Would that make a normal adult?' The man in the hedge who looked out the window was irritated and when the male protagonist interacted with him, he looked pathetic. Would a normal adult endure someone as irritating as he?
