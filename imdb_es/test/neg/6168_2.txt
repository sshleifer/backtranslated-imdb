Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ... Not a bad cast in my opinion, however, they were totally wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no real direction, there was nothing unusual Shifts, in fact the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying partner who did nothing but irritate him from the start. Rosario Dawson was totally wasted and it almost did not make sense to have her character in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really think that this is one of those direct DVD movies that everyone will forget very quickly, which is a pity because the movie could have been much better.
