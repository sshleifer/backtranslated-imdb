I saw this movie, or part of it, in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just nonsense. For one, you have the worst performance EVER! The main "actress", Birgitte Nielsen, is terrible, uninspired and hardly attractive. And it certainly does not look like the warrior who could easily kick some of the veteran warrior kings, but she does. And what is the feminist attitude, it is pure hypocrisy. On the one hand, his family was killed by a woman, then she joins a warrior school or something, so she can learn how to fight against men. He then joins with a fat servant and his son king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are simply stupid and destroy the little atmosphere that the film managed to create. After this, I could not stand Nielsen's painful performance anymore, and the stupid clich√©s and the lack of real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that really made it remotely visible. <br /> <br /> I liked Conan's movie, but this is pure shit!
