Another sadistic and ultra-venial movie of revenge of the late 70's and early 80's? Wes Craven surely launched a popular trend with his "Last house on the left", although "Terror Express" is more like a scam than other scams, such as "I Spit on Grave" and especially "Night Train Murders". In the sense of history, this film has absolutely nothing new to offer, so the only thing left for director Ferdinando Baldi to do was multiply the sordid factor by a thousand! This is really just a soft core porn movie that gets a bit rough around the end. On the night train in Rome there are three desperately imbecile losers who run mad. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass females. Things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who is still deceived by the three. This is a very docile movie and there was not even enough budget to buy a couple of bags of fake blood. This type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal sequences of rape and discriminatory behavior towards women, but the sex in "Terror Express" is not disturbing at all. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally pleasing their victims and then themselves. The music is great, the dialogues are, unintentionally, hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous I've seen. The villains are weak and the passengers on the trains are so motionless that they seem part of the whole. If you like your exploitation as sordid as it is, this is your movie. However, their hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not subside. "Terror Express" should be in the pornography section of videostores.
