I recently saw a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about something terrible! Any film that Ed Wood has edited looks like the Oscar material compared to this silly laugh. To be fair, a couple of lines of the script will live in memory for a long time, as "These people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meat in a supermarket like us, they get it fresh every day from people like you or me!" Classic! The leader of the crazy Jonesville type in the jungle was the best character in the movie, he really looked like a madman. I think he was the only actor who was not doubled (bad), if these Italians should have American characters in his films, why do not they get Americans to participate in the dialogue instead of the English doing their best to sound like Annie Oakley? I will give 3 out of 10, I will give 3 because it is more fun than most comedies of these days.
