This was, by far, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. And that's in comparison to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world. <br /> <br /> I should go back to the blockbuster and ask for my money back along with the compensation, since it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes, I was changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be off the screen. I did not think it was possible to make such a bad movie at this time, I was wrong. As I write this message, I thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke present at Christmas. I'm blaming the lady of this, since she chose him, thank you baby. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... A real surprise during everything !!!!!!
