Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80s, the decade of cheese. I saw it for the first time without cuts and without MST3K, and it was quite fun to laugh out loud even without the comments. <br /> <br /> The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which AI robots rebelled (sounds familiar to them?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving a world in ruins with an air so bad that nobody can breathe it. The few remaining humans act as slaves to an enigmatic being called The Dark One, which appears to be partly computer and partly organic. The "air slaves" work to produce energy for this change in exchange for breathable air. Occasionally, the Dark One has the strongest of the air slaves who fight to the death, so that no one will rise as leader in a revolt against the Dark One. <br /> <br /> Well, that's the so-called serious things. Let's move on to silly things, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothes that everyone practices, including the "skin" garments that cover the seats of automobiles, the spine fabrics and the bright things and the feather boas (used mainly by the Henchwoman of the Dark One, a girl with an unrecognizable and almost incomprehensible accent). Or the wooden lines actuated and forced displayed by all the so-called "actors", whose dialogue is high in pretension and low in sense. Or the special fx of the dime shop, which includes pink socks with teeth glued to them for "deadly" sewer snakes, a bomb made of piano wire and a can, and terrible "mutants" with masks Halloween rubber <br /> <br /> A band of aerial slaves follows its leader, a mysterious vagabond who has adapted to the outside air, to go to the power plant and destroy the Dark One. The name of the boy is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea of ​​the Matrix. They meet with a group of Amazons on the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the woman is overcome (of course). Has anyone else ever noticed it in every Amazon movie or television? The show that has taken place, are these so-called amazing warriors always beaten by men or women? The Amazons are just thoughts, I suppose. <br /> <br /> This band of determined warriors makes their way through Central Park ... errr ... the devastated lands beyond the last city on foot (a good way to save money on matte paintings from a destroyed New York City, anyway) and travel to the sewers that lead to the Energy Central, where the Dark One and his go-go females, Valeria, hang out. Here beasts are defeated beasts like the puppet worms of the socks, a giant spider that nobody sees, and the lobster robot that is one of the personal guards of the Darkness. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl whose father was kidnapped by the Dark One because he had created a way for people to breathe the dirty air, sees that his father has been "consumed by the true form of the Dark One", which implies that he is eaten by a giant avocado until only its head protrudes. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark by turning off some switches, and the holocaust robot does not die suddenly but with a groan. The two humans exchange a little wood. lines, and that's it. The end.
