Stay Alive, Stay Alive, Stay Alive, they called my attention, it was the trailer and not the poster. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film focused on a video that I reproduce that was created by a Countess to kill People and live eternally are acceptable. <br /> <br /> First of all, a bad horror movie, the blood is more or less provoked (spread of gossip), these scenes bleed, they are the worst. <br /> <br /> But actually (in fact) how bad this movie is, very, very bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone, well, trailer, Bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not try because (how, how) spend (consume) money and time making these movies meaningless and very bad.
