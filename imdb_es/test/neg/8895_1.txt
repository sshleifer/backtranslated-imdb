I was a Buffy fan and I was hoping it would come to an appropriate end when Angel had just one more season. But when the end approached, I was thrilled to see that. And what do we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in this episode. This is absolutely the worst way in this series. Why could not I have a happy ending? Why did some of the main characters have to die? Why did not Angel become a human and reunited with Buffy again? No. Angel has to sign this piece of bloddy paper that will never become a human being. How stupid <br /> <br /> And the end is a suspense. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffyshow started as well as Angel, but the Universe hole ended so horrible. Someone should bewitch the man who wrote the script for this episode and make sure he gets lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So do not bother seeing this, it's so bad it hurts! Totally 1 out of 10.
