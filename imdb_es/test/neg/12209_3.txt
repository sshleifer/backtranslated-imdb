As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I can not say that I enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I've seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel calls for a miniseries of several hours, instead of a normal movie. It is simply impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I do not like the flashback format. It was disconnected and it would be impossible for someone who did not know the story to fully understand it. Also, I do not think the filmmakers correctly interpreted Copperfield's personality. The idea of ​​him strolling along a beach complaining about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive and progressive nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also bothered me. She presented herself as a homey decoration, instead of a strong woman. Dora was perfect, however. This movie was full of problems, and I look forward to someone making a decent screen version.
