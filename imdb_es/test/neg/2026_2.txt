The beginning of a voiceover sounds like 'The Wind' could be a pretty intriguing movie, but as the story unfolds I knew it was a descent from there. The most important thing in this movie that exploded were the terribly bad acting jobs that all the main characters did (except for some scenes that involve Mic's internal confusion), there was a total lack of character development and there is no point in the plot. What were the writers thinking? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo won 2 'horror / sci fi' awards for 'The Wind'. HUH? What was it that you were most afraid of with this movie? NOTHING! Except for the video footage of evil 2 residents, the rest was more like a 'thriller made for television', it would not even have to be edited. If you want a much better movie about renting "murder between friends", "shallow grave" instead. <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
