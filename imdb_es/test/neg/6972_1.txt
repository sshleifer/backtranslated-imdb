Let me say this about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that he would like more people to have. If we all had the optimism and the dominant hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. Being familiar with the story of Ed Wood and having seen the wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994) several times, I admire his audacity and his efforts for the work he loved; I still admire his attitude of never saying or dying. I had a love for direction that I wish more people in modern Hollywood had. <br /> <br /> But that does not make your movies more fun to watch. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most confessional movie, is probably his worst movie. <br /> <br /> "Glen or Glenda" is a deadly cult movie about a transvestite named Glen (played by the director / same writer Ed Wood) who despite his love for his girlfriend Barbara (Dolores Fuller) , it seems that he can not conquer his lust for transvestism, in which he dresses in women's clothes and a wig and thus becomes ... Glenda! Glen / Glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he is also spoken and guarded by a mysterious character called "The Scientist", played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there is also a sub-story about a character from Alan / Anne who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, about whom this movie originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" It was based previously. <br /> <br /> Did I already hang your jaw? Well, as much as I want to warn you about this image if you have never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not a single word of falsehood in the synopsis of the plot I gave it. Everything in it is true. This is a film about transvestites and transsexuals, a subject that does not sound very attractive to begin with and is not done in a very attractive way. I am sure that with a good script and a good director (he had none) that "Glen or Glenda", despite the subject, could have been a very moving image. It is a confessional film by Wood, since he was a transvestite in real life and on the screen. But, once again, that does not make it a good movie ... or one that can be seen. "Glen or Glenda" is a messy and messy mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad movies. It makes no more sense than his notoriously silly scene in which Bela Lugosi shouts "Throw the rope!" On inexplicable images of bison in stampede. Most of the film is narrated with a monotonous voice, which reminds me of some very bad short informative films I've seen before. It's as if one of those really bad short films expanded to a function of seventy minutes and twice as boring. We sat there for centuries waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to generate energy, since the camera is locked in one position for many exhausting minutes and long periods of time when nothing happens. The only moments that are worthwhile are those of Bela Lugosi, who manages to bring some light to these dark trenches. I guess Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the movie, but personally, I do not care less who or what is supposed to be. I'll tell you what it was: a talented actor who ended up making garbage. But he and Wood were very good friends and they liked to work together, very well for him. <br /> <br /> I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for cinema, but I never will. As long as I live, I admire his films. A film critic once said that Ed Wood's films were "innocent fun", but I think even that is questionable. Innocent? Yes. Funny? No sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Mount Everest of the film world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably Mariana Trench.
