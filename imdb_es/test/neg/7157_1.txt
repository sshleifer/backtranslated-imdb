Contain spoilers! These guys are a total scam, they made the lost scrolls of Judas, saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly a test to destroy a religion, and it should be illegal. They have no proof, it could clearly be a configuration. How can we know and trust these people? What if they carve the grave and "say it"? And in the end they seal the grave forever so no one can go to investigate? How stupid do you think we are, really? Are we supposed to trust that they are reliable people? Who really found a tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians like this? I believe that this documentary should NEVER be done by a non-religious man. ONLY can a Christian do it and I mean DIRECTION AND WRITING. It should be illegal for Jews to film a documentary related to Christianity, especially if the documentary makes accusations that Jesus is not a "Son of God who resurrected" (nothing against this, they could be Buddhists or atheists, anything but Catholic). /> <br /> For me this is a total deception, a pure documentary scam. They sealed the tomb so that people "would not" think about reviewing things. This documentary is a total failure, how stupid do you think Christians are? And what about the lost pages of Judas ... that was also a total scam, they said seriously at the end, something like: "We know some people who could make fake scrolls like these, and nobody would know. ... Oh, my God, they just said it ... "Dude, we could have done this" ... This kind of documentary should be illegal, it's a stabbing for all Christians and Catholics who should be behind bars !!! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now I am an atheist, but I have values ​​and I will always respect the religion of others. The part where Israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was BEAUTIFUL! BEAUTIFUL!!
