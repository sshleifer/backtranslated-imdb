First of all, I will give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10. It was nothing more than an aspiring movie. I was very disappointed to see this movie. I was led to the people, it would be more drama and more data about the real story on which it is based. Instead, I spent more than an hour watching a middle-aged person break the law and take drugs. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a football factory but without a real story or a good ending. After watching the movie, I asked myself "What was that movie about?" If you like movies without a real story and many drug takes and oaths, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a GREAT fan of mafia and gangster movies, but this movie did not live up to it. to the hype. I can see where the writer was trying to go with the film, but he never reached his destination. One of the worst British films I've ever seen. If only the movie had more than one story, this would have an excellent movie.
