I really did not care about this. If they had gotten rid of the comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, this might have been worth it. <br /> <br /> The more the movie went, the less I liked the protagonist / postman. . He has interesting things to say, but he is also a hypocrite and insecure imbecile. <br /> <br /> 3/10
