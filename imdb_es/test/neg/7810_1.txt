I was intrigued by the nasty boss character, since I myself am one, and the boss's real daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger Ashton Kushner, but this movie is so childish that I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to see it. When people began to pee all over the living room, it was too much to look at. Painful, horrible fucking movie. If they had toned it down a bit. Are there really people out there who find it funny and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. The professional side of the story was intriguing, as was the young man who tried to get a promotion and win the favor of the bosses. I liked that part. Also, the opening scene with the co-workers on the train was great, since I like their characters. If you can handle meaningless movies or you're pretty young, then it could be one you can stand.
