My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were on the floor of the cutting room. The funniest line is that the movie is "nothing with the statistics". Anyway, this was filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is / was called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this movie is that the main character (who is not mentioned in the box because Bolo brings more power) is supposed to be a police detective ... a great opportunity to drive in a red convertible Porsche. I need to get a copy of this, preferably the director's version, in order to see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene you are in is the beginning when you are in the dance club. He got the job because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-professional soccer team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. It's interesting because his name appears as the first entry in IMDb. Fame has it, fortune, not so much.
