It is a shame that someone so idolized by many children, as well as parents, should degrade themselves by appearing in this exploitative crew, who jump in a car. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom in his later years remembered his excuse for a movie with pride. At least Sally Geeson had the decency to retire to do something worthwhile after appearing in this low-budget garbage. A cameo from a forgotten pop long ago called Pretty Things can not rescue the film from its horror. If you want the nostalgia of the 60s, invest in 'Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush' instead, starring Barry Evans and Sally's sister, Judy.
