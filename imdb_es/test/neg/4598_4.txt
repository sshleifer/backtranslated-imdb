About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine. I blindly accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in several movies. Of course, I could never meet the intellectual types who prescribed Bukowski as a hero. Generally, they can be found safely behind the counter in video stores and hipster record stores. These people barely spoke and when they asked a question, they usually mocked and nodded in a vague direction. They were useless when it came to locating a specific title, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique titles. To be enrolled in the secret and nonconformist club, I believed that I had to get rid of my bourgeoisie and adopt the counterculture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski began with the movie Barfly, the late 80s movie starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at that time. He also embodied a kind of modern fantastic male antihero, a brooding intellectual type. At that time, this appealed to me. The hero of Barfly mocked the convention. A vagabond of the mid-30s, who lives life without ties, does not respond to anyone, --Oh, and to be recognized as a genius by a hot literary snob woman, the icing on the cake. Later, I read Post-Office and Hollywood, and later it was Bukowski's version of his experience with the film. Now, let me move quickly to the latest film based on Bukowski's Factotum, one that I read and enjoyed. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fiction film Bukowski remains the same. I've seen about an hour of the movie and I still have not seen signs of cracking the facade. Here is why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is handsome (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean and tidy hair, with style, but not on top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks great. Chinaski goes from one job to another, ignoring and / or fighting with several bosses. Screw two floozies, one of which lives, leaves, only to return with little repercussion. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him emote. It's a sterile, one-dimensional archetype of 30 and something, James Dean. Factotum lies to the viewer. He does it by haranguing the idea of ​​a man (a writer) without consequences. A poor man, who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than that? Now, let's say there are some truths in Factotum, in which the events took place. What is missing from the audience is the pain that surrounds Chinaski's existence. Maybe the point of this film, and most of the films, is that for 80 minutes, we need to escape from the world that is full of consequences and pain and to take on indirectly with an antisocial womanizer, who smokes, talks, drinks with detachment. freshness. Who rejects the conventional behavior of work and family. My hero used to be Movie Bukowski. A long time ago, that would have worked. It was easier then. Now, I still have to claim a hero. Things are not so easy. The nonconformist logic and the cinematographic representations of counterculture icons do not offer solutions or even ask questions.
