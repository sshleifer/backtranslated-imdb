Now do not get me wrong. I love bad movies ... no, I love bad movies, Troll 2 ... oh, painful, Hands The hands of fate ... I only see Torgo leave, Guru the Mad Monk ... is that The noise of traffic in the medieval background? Ok, that's clear, but this is one of those movies that was obviously trying to be something better, but it did not. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but I've seen worse, there were not too many holes and I know there is not much originality, but that does not have to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck is quite threatening, where did it go wrong? Well, I'd love to blame Harley, who looks like 'Chris Moyles' ... I'll do it! Comedy and horror are hard to mix, bad comedy and horror get worse, and there's the problem. I hated this guy from the moment he poked his head out (literally), the continued pursuit of the too tame Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that he loses the belief that the softer people would not react by pushing him out of the car in door movement ... and I thought they were the monstrous parts that the director should have trouble convincing us. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have a lot of fun doing holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers, etc. This movie does not make the coveted category of "Worst Movies" because it's just bad because of the annoyance that is said. Do not bother, go see something else and you will be a better person for it ... I promise! (Fade to the songs of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
