I observed it due to the description and art of the cover, and once again I was deceived. I'm getting tired of all these great new horror movies for DVD. Once in the blue moon 1 will be fine. It started with a confusing scene and then it jumped for 30 years and showed a couple one night during a storm that was good because I like storms and it creates a good mood. Then it became a great trip on the highway where they ended up in a restaurant. Finding strange people. The rest became strange and then became confused. I saw it until the end, but I was even more confused when it ended so badly. I had more hope in this movie, but it was more like a science fiction than a horror and something like that. That should have been done for television.
