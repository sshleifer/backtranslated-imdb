Do you want a great recipe for failure? Take a leftist and shitty political plot, add some weak and underdeveloped characters and then release the worst sequences a film has ever known. Let stand for a week (the amount of time you have probably spent doing this garbage). <br /> <br /> The result is 'Stealing this movie', a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous places and exotically never before conceived. . <br /> <br /> This movie blew fragments in my face throughout its execution time. Words can not express how painful it was to look. This is not one of those bad movies in which you and your friends can sit and mock. This is not 'Plan 9 from outer space'. This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. "Stealing this movie" is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've seen. It depresses me when I realize that people * really * took the time of their lives to act on this gut, if you can call it "acting". But again, when you have bad direction, bad writing, poor EVERYTHING, "acting" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a huge and unpleasant turd that you long to eliminate quickly. of existence, afraid that a friend or loved one may see it in some way. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so that it does not contaminate the minds of would-be filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me a new respect for all the other movies I've seen. You have shown me what is really horrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just fucking and / or boring.
