The defining scene of this movie is when the fat man gives up, but the evil doctor only gives one more duty, check the dinosaurs. Keep in mind that you no longer have this job and therefore you are not paid for this. Keep in mind that it's a damn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is bad and does not like it. But keep saying, yes, it's fine. That just defined the stupidity of this movie. Melissa Brasselle shows that, seriously, anyone can back down. some breasts and being in movies. I can ride a mountain bike among them, but other than that, the people of Paraguay are very nice. Eric Roberts has his absolute worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe how boring he is. Corne Bernsen keeps what needs to be saved and you start to encourage him, but they have to follow the formula, of course. And I wonder how much your life sucks when you play, one of the army types in this? How low can your career as an actor go? The special effects are so embarrassingly wrong that you expect a sign that says "Studio 3" to enter the frame. It is not even an honest pulp, everything is taken from "Carnosaur", which even stunk on its own. And then I wonder why anyone can make a movie.
