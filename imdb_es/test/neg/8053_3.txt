The unexpected turn of director Todd Verow in a sentimental presentation drama produces a predictable result: there is nothing new to see here. Attractive but unconvincing, are these 20-year-olds supposed to be in high school? - I do not think that the way to explore the promise of Anonymous, which was equally selfish, but also honest, raw and, in comparison, not all that is sensible, does not seem like a mockery about the confused adolescent sexuality. I have no idea what to do with this monotonous and boring movie other than the hope that Verow will find another career. Sure, it's unpretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> However, no attribute is as horrible as Jim Dwyer's distorted electronic score, which he replicates non-stop, from wall to wall the entire length of this movie. If he had seen this and heard this, in a theater, I would have left. Fortunately, on my laptop, I was able to scrub and hit silently.
