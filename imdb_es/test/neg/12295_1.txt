Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. This looks like a first-year, improvised art school project. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here will subject you to a painful combination of bass and exaggeration, and virtually every scene was terribly contrived and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film in no way reflects the culture or social conventions of Malaysia, no one speaks that way here. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems to be tailor made to win a prize in the category of foreign films of some western film festival. And unfortunately, that tactic seems to have worked. Some critics would no doubt describe it as "exotic," but a more accurate word would be "atrocious." <br /> <br />
