This is a terrible movie, barely recognizable by the book, although they have a similar kind of plot. The time it takes to see this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better spent doing something else, even watching the grass grow. The addition of ill-made fantasy scenes makes Catherine look unbearably stupid. The actress who plays Catherine also shows herself to be dizzy as all kindness and is constantly surprised, even when she is supposed to be looking with love in Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The film ends with a fantasy scene of Catherine in which one can not help wondering if it has happened or if it is simply an illusion, and not in the good way that makes you think, but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie . The only good thing about the film is the title, written by Mrs. Austen herself. In general, I love the BBC productions, but this is horrible.
