It's okay, it was very good ... but Best Movie? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, that should have won! The voters of the Academy seem to act like the current Democrats, please, just a little bit of everyone, but do not dare to take concrete positions. That's why we have a complete imbecile in charge in the United States. <br /> <br /> This has been the worst presentation of AA ... and forget about 1987 ... since much earlier. Hollywood fears its final balance so much, that it can not be defined "directly". Many voters apparently did not even see Brokeback Mountain. Be real and follow it. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic year since I was watching in the mid-60s and I only had two. <br /> <br /> Wake up, whoever it is they are. Hollywood is the mainstream, and that's what happened to the box office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a new version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006. <br /> <br /> At least there were better original photos, that is, Munich, but I heard that before, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, although now we know that Reese can sing as Cash / Carter, etc., Syriana was a much better image than Crash. Has that movie been made since the early 1960s and we have to make it the best movie? What a horrible night for Oscar and a horrible year to end in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA for the best movie was for Brokeback, and what about the horrible song he won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years left like the United States or the United States, before someone comes in and changes things a bit. Maybe it's China, because they own a large part of this country ... or India, because they have all the high-tech jobs and they are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> The United States has become The land of the fat, the pathetic and the stupid. Garbage can be found in more places than Florida, West Virgina, South Dakota and in the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Drive through a local McDonald's or a Burger King for the sake of kindness. Order as much as you want until you have a heart attack. Get out of your misery.
