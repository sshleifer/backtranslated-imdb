Excerpt from the TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week in THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo. Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween special. Guest starring a guy with a really bad lizard costume like the Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is the typical Sci-Fi channel rate. The Captain of a cruise ship, played by the respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is on the trip and earns his living as the ship's kickboxing instructor. Pay attention, everyone, that kickboxing will be useful later! It should be noted that the Captain's daughter is quite uncoordinated and painful to watch. It would have been nice if she had taken a couple of kickboxing classes before playing an instructor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, an ingenious cryptozoologist and a dark and mysterious stranger on this 90-minute journey to boredom. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said cryptozoologist. Keep mentioning that you brought a precious cargo on board that you need to remove. It goes without saying that the box contains a Chupacabra that someone decides to let out. As of this moment, a man in the Chupacabra rubber suit runs around the ship, killing people. The Stupid Captain is powerless to stop him. He decides to call the marines, but tells them there is a group of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines respond. They say everything the Marines talk about like "Hooya" and "Get Some." But those foolish Marines are no match for a Chupacabra. They also do not tell anyone where they are going, so there is no help in sight. I guess no one will really miss a squalid battalion of lost Marines. But do not forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is, fortunately, a Kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! She arrives just in time, hits the bloodthirsty Cabra Sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means goat piglet. Therefore, chupacabras suck. But there is no way for chupacabras to bet as much as this movie.
