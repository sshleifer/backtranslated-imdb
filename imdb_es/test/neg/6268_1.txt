Do you hear that sound? That is the sound of H.G. Wells rolling on his grave, between this version and the film abortion of Spielberg has been a difficult year for the classic novel. But at least Steven guessed some things compared to this crapperella. Hello, the boats were not big insects, they had names. They were tripods and the aliens worked three at a time. The ships and the aliens were all wrong, you really can not see the aliens until the end. The effects and the cast work well. But these actors are much better than this "movie" deserves. Most, if not the entire movie, is the character of Howell who asks himself through devastation, meet a person, join him and lose them for one reason or another. There are no more than two people on camera at any one time, although most of the film. It's as if they were filming three at the same time that it would put the movie above the budget or something like that. So fat, the only and only visible adaptation of the history of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is the GEORGE PAL version in the 1950s. THE BLACK HOLE.
