Obviously it seems that a lot of people really enjoyed this movie, and that's wonderful. Without a doubt, it is a very well intentioned film, and I appreciate it in a time of cruel or emotionally harmful films. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of problems and it was not something I enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> The main problem is writing. It just is not very fun. When something tries to be nimble or ingenious and fails, that is much worse than when it has not been tried at all. This film is, to a large extent, a series of "retrospective" but gentle returns between the adult members of the family, neither of which seems imaginative or apt. There are also some central premises in the film that seem too much of an extension of coincidence or motivation of the character to be credible or really work. Part of the back story seemed more intriguing and served to decorate the story quite well, but it could not make up for the flatness from moment to moment that dominated almost the entire film. <br /> <The address / edition is also not compatible with the movie, although I do not know how to explain exactly how. Somehow, things always seemed to me rather false, and most of the actors were forcing their way through unnatural material. They tried, and I do not blame anyone here. There were also too many small roles without charm outside of the immediate family. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is not a good rental, although, once again, apparently many people found it very charming (I am 38 years old; I suspect that maybe people over 60 can enjoy more than this movie?).
