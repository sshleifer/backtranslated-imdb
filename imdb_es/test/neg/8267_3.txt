I found it a very disappointing experience! But I have added a better similar style option to the foot of this entry. <br /> <br /> This "Journey of Felicia" is intriguing. It has drama. But it's full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> Therefore, it ONLY serves the critical temperaments without worrying about true justice and justice and truth, beyond the black and white judgments that fit the "NEWS" announcements of 30 seconds that dot our multimedia experiences every day, especially the news Bulletins, true or deceptive in such representations! <br /> <br /> It's SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairy tale of "Little Red Ridinghood"! Consider the innocent unmarked girl crossing the borders questioned by a guard but released without any evidence to venture in search of her 'Romeo' who did not give her an address VERSUS the pathetic lack of substance in the hoarse voice of the 'helping' 'to befriend her with her improbable story made by the cape! <br /> <br /> It seems appropriate for the directors and the management team that no one has faith or pray to God, even in their moments of despair! <br /> <br /> So in these first adjustments, it is organized and says a lot of things to come! A nightmarish journey that betrays the essence of the substance without a fairy tale resolution, without truth, integrity or credibility! ... Then a turn and it's over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a MUCH higher movie that investigates similar topics with MUCH more credibility, with a much more powerful vision, watch the 1983 movie "Paul of the Man" by Paul Cox / Norman Kaye. <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will NOT be disappointed!
