First, separate the story from the movie. The story about a second continuous war in heaven is good, very good. The religious-themed films are not the main option for many people, but the angels at war are. I really loved the story, and some of the images provided to back it up like the field of angels in spikes ... awesome images. Although the film itself was bad, I can not find any reason for the main character, the priest and the policeman, to be there. The protagonist too ... there was no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was empty, it had no substance, the story could have been told without them. Now, some first-class performances appeared, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen achieved some eaves, although their scenes were mainly with lifeless cables. Native American rituals to purge the dark soul. The child that transports it is clearly of Native American origin, but apart from the final scenario there is nothing that connects here with that heritage. The plot concerning the dark soul was hardly counted, as strange as the dark soul is the conductor of the entire premise of the film. The background story of its original owner (the colonel) is touched briefly, but not enough to allow him to understand why it is his soul that is special. <br /> <br /> I can not find a justification for the displacement landscapes. in this film, too, several of the plains around the 'rock of chimney'. I got the feeling that they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it since none of the shots have relevance, nor do they agree with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the category of science fiction rather than horror. There was no real shock or scary scenes, some soft blood and blood, but no element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the 3 roles played, this movie is a big failure. Unfortunately, the doubtful factor exceeds the good acting factor, too many weekend actors.
