the real plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of post-civil war prostitutes are looking for alternative housing in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a close-knit family of prostitutes have been eating expired sausages for days and plan to move to the old Fort McMillian. The locals warn women to eat more of the old-fashioned sausage Because there is a vicious pyromaniac in the area and he refuses to transport them to the property. When they finally reach their destination, they discover that their stomach is full of gas after all the bad sausages. It is not long before they know why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
