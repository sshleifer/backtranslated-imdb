The first movie is a good thing for me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I really thought it was nothing so special. However, compared to this mess, it looks much better. Why they felt that the need to make the film surpasses me, but they should have known that it could not coincide with the performance of the first film when they could only make Ruth Gordon play her role again. The kind of story follows Rosemary's baby and all that, but it's really a disaster, it does not help that the movie is a television movie and that the television aspect shines very well. It also has a more comedic tone, which makes it very difficult, if you really felt the need to make a sequel, you should have made it an R-rated movie that had some nudity and gore. I'm sure it would still have been pretty bad, but at least it would have been more visible and fun than this movie is not even though it tries to be fun. I saw this in Monstervision and Joe Bob did not have anything really good to say about it and I do not have much to say either. I have to say it was a sequel that should never have seen the light of day.
