John Waters owes me 2 hours of my life back. I saw a preview like this in 1990, and I still have pain. Not before or since then have I seen such a terrible film waste thrown on the screen. There's nothing positive I can say about this movie. Acting - horrible; plot - ridiculous Music - atrocious. After the movie, my friends and I demanded our money from the theater manager. He explained that, since it was a free screening, he could not give us anything in return, no matter how much agony we were suffering. How Johnny Depp's career survived this brouhaha of a movie is something no one knows.
