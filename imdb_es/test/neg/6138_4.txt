It is likely that this film is a real disappointment unless you understand the circumstances in which it was made. The Marxes were chosen to be cast in the film version of a work that was not originally written for them. They are embedded in the roles. Ironically, it could have been more fun if he had used different actors who had not been given such high expectations. On the other hand, it has been consecrated forever as part of a canon that does not really deserve to belong.
