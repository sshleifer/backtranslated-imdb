I'm quite surprised to see that this movie got even lukewarm reviews, I found this movie absolutely horrible. The plot takes place trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller, and then he realizes that he can not achieve it either. So she throws in the towel and continues with her absurd plot highlighted with an involuntary hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection and a spilled coffee that leaves the audience writhing awkwardly in their seats, looking at each other, is this real? Basically, it's abysmal and really disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and it makes you think someone is blackmailing Laura Linney to add this piece of junk to her otherwise respectable resume. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I wish I had done it, even watching it for free I wanted someone to pay me for my lost time. The computer failure in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and in the end you do not care who wins the election. I vote directly to DVD.
