I saw this with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are incredible in their comedy, I was really expecting a riot of laughter. Unfortunately, that's not what I got at all ... Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I chuckled for one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was a badly made attempt at comedy and, in a way, a bit of an aspiring Hera Pheri. <br /> <br /> Of the three main types, I think the role of Paresh Rawal was the most powerful. It was not the most important role, but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. His performances were fine, I suppose. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole the role of Akshay in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film, and both were pretty bad. The role of Lara did not move me, nor did it make me laugh, and the character of Tanushree Dutta has just got nervous! Music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. It is also worth listening to "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag". <br /> <br /> You will like it or not. And judging from the bad comedy and the lack of direction, I do not think you'll do it.
