I had to write a review for this movie after having seen it last night and read some of the comments from people trying to classify the displeasure of this film (see the publication of wfmitchell)). I do not fit in any of those classifications. The other classification that should be on the list is 5) People did not like this movie because it was not good. I found the movie to be booring and forced. My wife chose him to see him because she is a great admirer of Kidman and also likes Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of law, it took a lot of time and a lot of suspension of beliefs for me. Believe in your Southern accent. I can not help but wonder if they did not make his character less talkative on purpose, so we would not have to listen so much to the tortured accent. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it took a long time for it to become interesting (around 1 or 1.5 hours), and then it stopped at its end. The interesting thing was that I did not know that this movie was directed by Minghella. 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife, "this is not going to be another English patient, right?" Absolutely it was. <br /> <br /> As for the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the initial battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that describes it accurately is simply "dumb." He was forced, incredible, silly and foolish. (After the battle, I looked at my wife and asked "was that just plain silly?", To which she nodded vigorously). <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the movie was Zellweger's performance. The role was a bit more to act like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From his speech pattern, his walking, his gestures and esp. his little jokes (my favorite: "If you want to climb 3 feet in the ass of a bull, all you have to do is listen to the couple talking to each other"), was able to create an almost cartoonish character who did his job . Extremely well. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people they say they like (or the English patient). I suspect that you could classify them in a category: 1) Fans of soap operas
