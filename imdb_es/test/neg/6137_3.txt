Picking this up along with the rest of the Marx Brothers box, I was disappointed by almost everything beyond A Night at the Opera. This stinking is, without a doubt, the worst I've seen of them so far, with the ingenious lines left aside and the characterization is unfortunate. The playwright is so stupid in this work that it is hard not to tackle television and try to strangle him. <br /> <br /> As things stand, marxes seem to do better when strangers are brought in to wreak havoc, and are much better when they have a good gag or two at least. The material here is written obviously for anyone, and really wastes Marx's talent. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
