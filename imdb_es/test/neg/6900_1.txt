When my six-year-old son fell asleep at the movies during this movie, it was all the confirmation I needed for this film to stink. It was boring. The parts of fear were boring. The maudlin parts were boring. Even the funny parts, with two minor exceptions, were boring. And predictable. And did I mention predictable? Examples: 1) The abrupt but affectionate dad who pampers his son with a child. 2) The gruff but affectionate dad who buys the farm (while singing a song?). 3) The brat of a child who decides to cut and run, but, thanks to his friends, excels because they need it. 4) The brat of a child who wins against incredible odds. 5) And a cheeky character expressed by an African-American actress. I have to give these filmmakers credit for a bit of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype. I mentioned two funny parts. In both cases, contributed by minor characters. The mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was fun. The farm dog that was the victim of his dog's weaknesses while fighting for leadership was fun. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a Hipness-Thru-Committee movie and make it even more modern by making it a computer animated movie, and this was the result. And why make the Batman-villain coyotes silly monologue with their victims, instead of just eating them? Oh yeah. No blood is needed in this children's movie, as it focuses on simulated alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and humor. And the fuzzy thing in the box? Exactly what it was exactly? A porcupine? Tasmanian devil? What, besides a really stupid plot device to help Cow Otis win the Mother of all battles? The corral is a bomb. And I did not even need to mention the udders.
