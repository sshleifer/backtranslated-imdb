"Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels" ... said Nuff. Just do not expect anything like "Devil Went Down To Georgia", the old Charles sorta speaks through a song at the beginning of Whiskey Mountain (duh) and that's all for the lyrics. However, fans of artistic rape scenes will love the Polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY movie) and who does not like the endless scenes of rednecks that gawk at the men of race? The art of the box made the movie look much weirder than it was, with the promise that "you can lose your life ... or your mind!", But they are mostly two couples walking the streets. sticks and "act" naturally. I love that hermit.
