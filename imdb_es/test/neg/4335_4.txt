Ben Stryker, a former green beret, stops in a small town called Dolee Water to visit an old friend Tick Rand. Shortly after traveling to the city on his Suzuki and settling down. A gang of motorcyclists known as 'The Savages', which is led by the tyrant Pigiron, invades and finally takes over the place. Stryker does not want to get involved, but that changes when his friends become the real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say about this bare element? Difficult call, since the only fundamental reason to see this low budget car accident is because of the tremendous distribution that the crew managed to postpone for this project. While I do not think it's a complete job, it's not terribly good either. Now what deal! Lance Henriksen (being the main character, strangely does not have the best mark, but the final), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this scary, low-budget bungle? The superficiality of the material is too one-dimensional, since it borrows ideas from better films (ie, Mad Max) and presents a complete mess of ideas that simply do not fit and could have been better thought out. The clich√©s that are used can be manipulated for a good visualization, in spite of being predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let it run in a scant way, without letting the spectator absorb it all. The majority of the cast is wasted in no papers. A whitish-blond Henriksen is capable of being solid and even with his complimentary presence that provides an enigmatic brilliance to his character. He does not manage much and sometimes disappears into action. Too much side action, but when he kicked some motorcyclists' butts, good times flowed. The sibilant performance of Karen Black is very strange and it is about screams and curses. Even though she gets into a memorable fight with the coquettish character of Claudia Udy, Katie. A wheelchair, George Kennedy, wanders aimlessly until the final assault and Richard Lynch seems embarrassed as a capricious priest / mayor of the city in a very redundant role. A Bill Forsythe on the edge simply chews him up as the head of the notorious package of bikers. <br /> <br /> The story of addicts (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has that daring comics outfit and is very influenced. For the Western genre. Just look at the villains for that. How they came up with their name is a mystery. Maybe they pulled them out of a hat. It is a fairly second-order material that most often moves in one lackluster scene after another. The extravagant comic elements are included and also a bit of sleaze. Sticky operation that does not get sufficiently rough and the deaths are pretty ridiculous. A clumsy script is filled with complicated details and unbearable trivial. The irregular direction of Simon Nuchtern was by numbers and timidly distributed. One or two intense scenes can not be put on because of their turtle rhythm and many stiff-handed stunts. The cardboard games had a dirty appearance, but lacked that organic sense. Gerald Feil's gravel cinematography was best handled when the main focus was not on the city, but on the desolate background (like the beginning and end of the film's climax) with some camera touches. Pino Donaggio's clumsy music options are drowned out by their own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is a midnight movie that can be forgotten and that is a definite power failure for the most part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same kind out there.
