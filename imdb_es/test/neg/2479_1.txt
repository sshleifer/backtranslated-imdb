Really, REALLY ... What pleases the audience (American!) In this so-called program is totally out of reach. What can we learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Every casino there is spending around 2-3 billion dollars every year to rent a satellite and a huge amount of hi-tech high-resolution cameras for your security team Let the FBI bite their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security employee should have voluptuous breasts, of course natural. The tits must be shown all the time, otherwise they will lose their work. <br /> <br /> 3. If it turns out that the employee is a man, you need to have your breasts implanted, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can you shamelessly get rid of the ideas of other programs, implement them as their own and call this shit "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. All security with tits bigger than 39D is considered immortal and can not die. <br /> <br /> I would really like to have the opportunity to vote with negative values. -10/10 for this one!
