A boring mystery thriller, which may sound pretty good in theory but works very badly. The ridiculous script is full of people (MINOR SPOILER) who die and then come back to life when the plot requires it, and the director does not seem capable of working with energy and suspense. The sticky sequence that kind of "explains" the title of the movie is the only memorable half in this exhausting movie. (* 1/2)
