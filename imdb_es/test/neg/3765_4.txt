I like this movie and I've seen my copy twice since I acquired it a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I have not checked the dates, but I bet this movie came out after and almost at the same time as the popularisations of Collier and Walt Disney in The Vision of Space Flight being promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to appear objectively correct and scientific. However, while certain ideas are transmitted (step-drivers, for example) approximately correctly, other things are hilariously incorrect. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter the space ... how to get to the top of a flight of stairs and turn towards the landing! We are then told that by rotating in the direction of the Earth's rotation, the total speed of the ship increases accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. Most space launch centers are located as close as possible to the equator, where the Earth and anything on its surface is spinning at about a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket that goes out into space, in an easterly direction (like the rotation of the planet). ). Of course, if the ship turned to travel west once in space, its speed relative to the surface of the Earth would be higher, but it would add nothing to the actual speed of the vehicle. Decided in this movie as "air speed"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers only feel free fall, or "weightlessness" when they reach a few thousand kilometers from Earth, outside the gravitational field of the planets. Again, comically incorrect. Most ships with crews do not travel more than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they (and their contents, including the crew) travel at an adequate speed so that their momentum in an outward direction balances the force of gravity inward, it will. orbit in free fall. Of course, travel far enough from Earth and even a slow object will move outward from Earth's gravitational well, but to exit Earth's orbit, outward (toward the Moon, for example) is required the "escape velocity", around twenty-one thousand miles per hour. So the vehicle will have already reached "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness") by definition. <br /> <br /> But the movie has much more fun than this. Someone decided that it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem, they fell asleep for a few days and then woke up and discovered that they had accidentally gone to Mars! Then the captain thinks that this must have been a divine intervention! At that moment, any pretense to be a scientist breaks into pieces like confetti and throws himself into the wind in the middle of the joyous dance of an increasingly clumsy plot. <br /> <br /> The strength of a film like this, in fact, is in illustrating "how far we've come". No less important in attitudes towards women. The condescending nonsense filled on the crew member is both hilarious and also shocking. Think that those attitudes were so "normal" recently. <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining. , as one night, the lights are turned off through the romance of traveling in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it actually happened. An antidote to the cold routine of space flight as it has become in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending. It is brave and shocking for a movie of this era and character.
