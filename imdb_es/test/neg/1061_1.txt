This movie is surprisingly poor. It was on TV when I tuned in during an action scene and I chuckled at the cheesy and macho dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a couple of minutes to realize that it was not really a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. What you have to remember is that someone really sat down and wrote this movie, and worse yet, other people funded it and gave it the green light. <br /> <br /> Rutger Hauer obviously does not read movie scripts before he enrolls, either or has some very serious debts to pay. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this movie is so bad, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it was really funded, and how a TV The channel must have paid money for the rights to broadcast it. The dialogue between hero and bad while trying to shoot each other from the sky is particularly painful, since the dialogue sounds as if it had been generated by a Texas Speak "Spice and Spell". <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine in is the worst thing though fun
