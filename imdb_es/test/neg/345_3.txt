I think it's safe to say that if you only watch standard box office movies or any premium production, do not bother with this movie, as you will hate it. If you're a movie fan too critical, do not bother either. If you love science fiction movies and do not care in what capacity you can glimpse the future, then you will entertain a little. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super low, but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were quite bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible, but it is quite obvious that they had good support from a computer perspective, since the scenes of the planet and the extraterrestrial images were quite inventive. The dialogue is quite fun, but it is not entirely poor. As for the story, well, I'm not quite sure what really happened to tell you the truth.
