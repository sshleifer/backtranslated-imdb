This movie has been made before. It is basically an unoriginal combo of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some funny bits, but otherwise it's a clich√© boredom. It's a good first film attempt and the director (who also plays and wrote the feature film) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was a little choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other movies. However, the performance was very good and the film was filmed in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see that gay-themed films are not so stuck with political correctness and the tired stories of anguish. The main character seemed pretty well suited for a gay teenager in rural Texas, so there's no saccharin, which is coming out of the drama here!
