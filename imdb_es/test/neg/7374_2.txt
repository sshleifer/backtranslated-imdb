That is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Historical accuracy is totally non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, who describes himself as an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London during the summer of 1759. The natives are like the Indians of a bad Hollywood movie of the 60s: they wear deerskin clothing and they ride on horseback (the Montagnais had never ride horses). The film is being held in Quebec City, but the images are in Louisbourg, showing the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> It was assumed that the original scenario included the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, but the producers abandon this idea. To say that the costs of uniforms and participants would be more than 4 million dollars! I think they never heard about recreation. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is planned to be a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France). There is even a song performed by Celine Dion at the end of the movie (Yes, I stayed until the end of the movie, but I deeply regret it). But the worst of all is that this movie costs 30 million dollars. I just do not know how they spend all this money. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my anger, but I'm too irritated.
