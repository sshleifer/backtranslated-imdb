"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being flogged by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally arrives in Hollywood and meets the best guitarist he has ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> After a small dispute, the two decide to join forces and act on an open mic night in what appears to be a less popular bar. To their surprise, they do not do so well. <br /> <br /> Back in their slightly less spectacular apartment, the two are trying to figure out what rock legends have that they do not do while they watch some old magazines. Only then do they realize that the guitarists in the covers have the same guitar selection. <br /> <br /> When trying to find a similar selection, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also a member of the movie). Executive Producer) tells you the old story of "Pick of Destiny", you are looking for. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the selection, which was made with Satan's tooth, is in a museum of rock history. <br /> <br /> Now the two losers who smoke in the pot with Delusions of grandeur go on an adventure full of music to steal the selection. <br /> <br /> Let me say this from the beginning, if you're not a fan of Tenacious D, who gave us the comedy of actor Jack Black, then you should skip this one. I'm not a fan of these two, and I only saw it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> The jokes, for the most part, produce silence more than anything. I laughed at maybe three of the jokes, and I chuckled. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, of which I am not. <br /> <br /> This movie is delayed in many places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that, when Black and Glass are not working together, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are played by Tenacious D. Many of the songs Perfectly advance the story by describing their adventures at the time of the movie. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be separated. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that language will turn off many people. There are many four-letter words in this movie. There are also some drug references. I would not recommend this to children. <br /> <br /> Part of Tenacious D's scheme is that Black is on your face, and Glass remains in its shadows for the most part. That's how they are in this movie, and it really does not work. Now, this may have been part of the act, but I felt that Glass simply did not want to be there. In one scene, he interprets his lyrics (in the background) at a party and can not work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D are supposedly rock fans in real life, and maybe they have two rock legends in the movie. , I lost the account because I was so bored with this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see more rock legends and icons in the film. However, we do not understand that. <br /> <br /> What we do get is a movie full of completely bad jokes, a lot of rude language, a dull script. You also get a horrible performance, and a non-original story. However, you get some pretty good songs that almost sound the same. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many of the scenes seemed to have been added to the film at the last second. This is somewhat similar to the Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had many more followers and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D only has a small number of followers, with some special HBO offers to his credit. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tenacious D fan, I suggest you take a look. However, like most of the cinematic audience when this movie premiered in theaters, I would say that this should be avoided. Save your money in this case, friends.
