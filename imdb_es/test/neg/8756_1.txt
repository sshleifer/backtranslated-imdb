Most low-budget horror movies, made exclusively for video, from the '80s, invariably stink worse than old, obscene socks. This blood bath particularly grim and amateur with no budget set in the basement of bargain "nasty necrophiles in the trash" serves as a depressing affirmation of this ineluctable fact limit. A psychic-hippie fruitcake with wild eyes, with a beard, disheveled hair, long hair, beads and flowers, embarks on your thug of standard frightful and random killings, and graphically kills young and libidinous couples who are dedicated to a strenuous intercourse every time the crazy lunatic Mansones. (Mmm, do I detect here a quite obvious and purely self-purifying message of "having sex and dying?" Wow, could it be, man.) Boy, this mentally unbalanced situation is a real way of disappearing a puppy: after stabbing its victims female, our certifiable cookie killer enjoys making love with their newly murdered bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * forward.) Towards the end of the image, the madman copulating the corpse is abruptly interrupted by the police while he is in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a nubile corpse, which causes the perverted pervert to release with a comprehensible anguish and the heartrending cry of "Nooo!") Now, is not this type of gonzo a definite bride and a half? <br /> <br /> Too bad this movie is so badly made; if only it had been done with a minimum of style and skill, it could have been a small jewel of an object of exploitation of horror. Unfortunately, the crooked direction of Wally Koz, the stubbornly static and motionless cinematography of Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth, the insipid "hard rock" score of Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez, monotonously banging his head, painfully cheap and unconvincing makeup f / x, flat, conspicuously restless plywood that acts for an appallingly unattractive and unattractive repulsor, lethargic rhythm (too much screen time is wasted in the monotonous efforts of the police to catch the madman), an unexpected and surprisingly surprising ending and surprising. (It is guaranteed that the true identity of the mysterious murderer will make you moan in disgust), the uniformly bored characters, who argue incessantly and are confident, and a constant succession of boring and boring sex scenes that are as erotic as watching two slugs competing for 90. all the minutes in a row add to a fleshy and cloying carving deeply spicy and unrewarding of an unpleasant clinker. However, to be fair, this film has a stellar virtue: the killer of rabid dogs indisputably has an excellent taste in tasty tropical Hawaiian shirts, noisier than thunder.
