I just wrote a comment on "ACES HIGH" (1976) and it reminds me of this movie that I saw when it was released; since then I've seen it only once and that was more than enough. As Kevin says, "it's a complete waste of time." Apart from the dog fights that are well done, the rest is a sequence of badly patched scenes with actors who fight with a louse script and an equally lousy direction. I do not remember the silly German accents mentioned by Kevin in his commentary, but that is another pathetic mistake; If Corman tried to make the characterization of the German pilots more convincing, why did not he use the German actors or double those parts? On the other hand, it is a good example of Hollywood's dreadful cinematic style with its "villains" so clearly identifiable, not only for their cruel actions but also for their grotesque accents. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "cruel actions" in the ridiculous scene in which Lieutenant Hermann Goering murders English nurses during an attack on an air base is an absolutely disgusting propaganda piece made with "historical hindsight" . If you want to see an objective, moving, very well acted and directed film about the air war during the First World War, watch "ACES HIGH" (1976) or that wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938) will not disappoint you.
