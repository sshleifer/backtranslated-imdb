This is one of the four films of the 1970s by television writer Lane Slate about sensationalist killings in small towns. They have sympathetic television personalities such as police chiefs and extravagant characters as regulars in the city, including light love interests. The others are: They only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and The girl in the empty tomb and the deadly game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda's is near Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); the others in California, Garner's at seaside ("Eden Landing") and Griffith's in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone tries to capture the feeling of a small city, move at a relaxed pace between the comfortable characters and tell a mystery with at least one complicated twist. At that level, they are somewhat entertaining (the fact that they are often re-run suggests that they have some appeal). But they suffer from stories and fine dialogues in general, from relaxed rhythm, from dull environments, from flat or exaggerated characters, and from unpleasant, forced (often juvenile or crude) attempts of color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda's and Garner's They are the most serious about history, characters, rhythm and tone. They have the best support molds, although those of Alda are best used; The Griffith turns pale in comparison. Alda's has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has some surprise and drama. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more uniform and the dialogue more natural than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others because of transplants from big cities to the city or by exaggerated and disgusting local characters, both of which appear as the product of a Hollywood screenwriter, not as genuine (the worst offensive is the pipsqueak from Griffith's movies, muttering the imbecile "Whit", who, we are told, tried to hook a jeep and escape with a trailer that functions as a temporary bank branch, dragged the dock to the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck just to get nothing for them, and complete $ 11 on the "Spiro T. Babylis" withdrawal receipt only to be discovered by the cashier). Fortunately absent is the clumsy and repetitive dialogue of Griffith's films ("Are you going to lunch?" "I'm going to take the boat out." "Are you going to take the boat for lunch?" "I'm not going to have lunch." "There's no fish in this lake, why are you fishing here? "" It's illegal in Horse Mountain. "It's also posted here, you're breaking the law." "Some law, there's no fish in this lake." "Then why are you fishing here? "" I told you, it's illegal at Horse Mountain. "" Please call me Lloyd, my name is Lloyd. "" It's okay, Lloyd ... "" Call me Lloyd, that's my name, my name is Lloyd ". <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low key and unimpressive to be taken seriously, even as a petty police chief, certainly not as a red-hot lawman sued by a rival city Slate has so much to admit to the character, when he arrives late at the scene of an obvious track by then, as a result of an accidental name recognition. Instead of detecting or investigating, Barnes blindly attacks in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser gives him a key clue ("Why did not I think about that," he says!). A shameful funeral scene, in addition to a plot plan, takes us to another gift track. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, Barnes is more interested in mocking the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests The blackboard has something against the military to direct them to them or to his own men effectively, he allows a late murder by incompetently protecting a known target, Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer who flees from a crime scene, without drawing his weapon or trying to take control. Again, it is ineffective, and almost dies, in the climate scene, which results from multiple errors on its part that are only partially corrected, by accident.The erratic accent of the Northeast that affects Alda does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> There are holes in the plot, why would the killer attack after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible, but they are nothing compared to the Later: a couple together, a merchant in his shop during working hours, a fully dressed agent sitting in his office and, incredibly, his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects in all movies. Barnes appears for the first time in the bed of a motel employee. Then he treats her rudely at every step and insults and tries to avoid his children. This, and talking about the doctor, with a crude and petty pattern (Garner's film has been described as "sordid", including a scene in which he and an officer laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that a man who was in the car hit him a part of the anatomy on the way in. Griffith's characteristic was a routine of Ropers de Ersatz, in which the woman tries to persuade the man in a "shameful" way, a free locker room-type exchange with an agent to talk about the death of a young man in a car accident ("Did he take it out?", "I took it out once".), a reference to the bank teller "Bernice" as "swollen" in some places "and" stick a pin "to her and" hate "and dismiss the secretary" Maude "because she was" too hairy ", a description of the doctor's practice as" two stirrup tables and a flashlight "; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan proposes to Griffith, who offers "something of homegrown, "and an insulting secondary plot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy, plays Like a drip jester, seems to" sleep around "). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film has a sombre, discolored, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit, scenery and pleasant music; Griffith went out to the mountainside, to the lake, and even to the big city. You feel more like returning to see Masters or Empty Tomb than Surprising.
