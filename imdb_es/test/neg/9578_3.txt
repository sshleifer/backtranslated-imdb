They call this movie "euro trash horror". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it is "euro". Trash? Oh, yes, the trash is fine. <br /> <br /> You know that a great movie awaits you when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you receive. I'm about to look. Expect crunches, strange cuts and that the film does not fit the screen. Also, there's the sound: at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then, carefully observing the lips, I realized that no, the quality of the sound is shamefully bad and desynchronized. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is quite ridiculous: an old and disfigured woman named Dr. Bannister kills a scientist for his youthful formula. I will not reveal much because when you see the "old woman" it is quite obvious that she is under a layer of coarse and poorly applied makeup. Anyone who has a sensation of good sense, seeing the false old age, knows what comes next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old witch" miraculously transforms into a beautiful young woman, complete with facial makeup and a long hair wig! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I mean that she has cornflakes stuck to her face. The film makes no attempt to explain how the cereals arrived. For that matter, there is no attempt to explain anything related to any of the characters. They never develop beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two policemen who chase our anti-heroine simply wander, apparently baffled by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist was working on a juvenile serum, the old woman has disappeared and we continue to find a young woman. How do these pieces fit together? What does this all mean?! One of the policemen sweats a lot and caresses his face with a cloth. The other smokes a pipe. That's almost all we have, in terms of character. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (the old woman, now a beauty) goes with strange costumes and then takes them off so we can see her flesh. She has relationships with men. She gets into a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown. She goes to Geneva so we can see the lake there. He skis a little on skis, then takes off his bathing suit to reveal a strange beaded curtain bikini. He takes off his clothes again with a strange ninja costume, striptease. <br /> <br /> The end? Well, without revealing anything, it's just a strange conclusion, added that it makes as little sense as the rest of the image. It's the kind of thing a writer can think of when the director wakes him up at 4 AM and says, "Quick! We need an end to our movie! What happens next?" <br /> <br /> The writer mutters something half awake, and the director runs with him. <br /> <br /> What's so good about this movie? Part of the music is campy and fun. That classic organ music of the 60s is so cheesy that it's enough to make you laugh out loud. There are some strange scenes of seduction, strange dialogues, moments of foolishness. <br /> <br /> It is very close to being so bad that it is good. I managed to see it from beginning to end without removing my eyes or crying. I guess that's a compliment.
