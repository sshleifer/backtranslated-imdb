It's a pity that so many people "love" Family Guy, because it's easily one of the worst TV shows, there are many points to discuss here. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks: now, in season 1 and 2, which I think was exceptional, the flashbacks were quite frequent, and were actually related to the theme of the plot and it was even fun. Now, season 4 and more, flashbacks are happening even more, and it has NOTHING to do with the plot, they are not fun, and really long, boring and pointless. Family Guy thinks that the long dragging scene that gets nowhere is fun, when in reality it is bad writing. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby that sounds British. How funny can that be? It is not. Your character is so unstable that it's amazing. Remember that early in the season, when Stewie was dominating the world and killing Lois. Well, now he only has scenes that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From wanting to dominate the world to being gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> References: How do you manage to continue making bad references to programs or events of the television of the 80s? Well, they just reuse the same old trash. You know, in 20 years, we expect Family Guy to be canceled by then, if you're still making jokes about 80's shows, it will be even more irrelevant than it was before. Because I will have forgotten it. This still makes me wonder why they can not just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice acting: My God, the voices in this program are very poor. Seth McFarlene should concentrate only on her horrible writing episode and stop making voices. All the extras in the already bad episodes of Family Guy sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. Some of them express around 15 to 20 characters ... they all sound very different. But why can not Family Guy do that? Oh right, it's a fucking show. <br /> <br /> The stuttering: usually performed by Peter, Stewie, Brian and any extra person, every time they talk or get offended by something, they have to stutter their sentences to try it. get a cheap laugh I can not believe that Family Guy can not even talk normally to make people laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Offensive: Ok, brief and simple, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting-edge, but in reality they fall flat every time. Go see South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible plots: the plots and lines of the story are simply garbage. The Simpsons have started their twentieth season and still have better plots than Family Guy. A total of 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that have no relevance. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many children have Stewie t-shirts and think it's a lot of fun, when in reality they do not even get terribly written sexual jokes. They just say, "Oh, ha ha, stewie!" when they do not even get it. Family Guy has been canceled twice, and brought back by DVD sales, how sad that is. They were canceled the first time, I think, after the 2nd or 3rd season, and honestly I think it should have been like that. those episodes back then were excellent, they should have been left on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag scenes and fall There are scenes that last too long. Peter, who aired last Sunday, went to an executive bathroom, where he spent about 2 minutes imitating the introduction to Jurassic Park, and the plot of that episode was also stolen from an episode of Seinfeld. It is also a scene in which Chris is working in a store and is talking to the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie, which also presents stuttering. THE CHICKEN STRUGGLES ARE SO STUPID, 3 of them, each longer than the last. Useless writing, without grace, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of career runs, between a chicken, yes a chicken. Now, every time someone falls and, by the way, NO TYPE OF FAMILY, THE FAN CAN DENY THIS, that each time they fall, it is less than a fraction of a second, and they ALWAYS land with the arm on their back to make that look funny i guess it has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks that the old pedophile is so funny when it's just a very bad joke. they have even tried to give him singing scenes (which are very poor) and to base ALL the episodes around him, they have done the same with other characters, like the doctor, who I know has had an episode based on him. . <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, it does not take much explanation here. There is so much evidence that a kind of family stole Simpson's jokes. How the family type is just a poor Simpsons man. <br /> <br /> so I'm sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere, but I'm sure this is enough to show that the family type is really a terrible, terribly written television show that Everyone Looks Like love, when you really should go see Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
