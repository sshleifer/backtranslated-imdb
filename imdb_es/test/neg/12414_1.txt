This movie begins with a man who seems to be a kind of sports driver. He meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat kid who never speaks, and a woman who rotates among the three. The group called the Angels of Satan, wants Rod, the driver, as his personal driver. He says no, but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to control them. They steal a gun shop in a scene ridiculously lost. The scene involves the woman walking in the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses. She says she wants protection and wants the merchant to carry the gun to show her how. She then takes it from the merchant and shoots him. The other three in the gang (excluding Rod) run to the store. They remove everything from the walls and then play with it like children who receive their toys on Christmas day. <br /> <br /> This movie surely does not waste precious time on the screen with an argument.
