I saw this movie by accident on TV and it was so incredibly horrible that I could not turn it off. Every piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from Oscar Wilde's story by the inept screenwriter. It hardly matters because the horrible acting, camera clich√© and cloying music would have ruined anything that resembled a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who presents himself as Shakespeare's most imbecile ghost of the craziest, talentless and least talented. "Get out of here!" He shouts in a moment while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. A really terrible movie and why do you wonder why Stewart, who can act when asked to do so, has tarnished his reputation by creating worthless pieces of junk like this and the XMen.
