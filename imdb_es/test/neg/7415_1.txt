I think this is one of my ten worst movies I've seen! There is like disappearing every two minutes. If this were on television, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a view that I personally enjoyed: that is when the blonde goes to bathe in a well of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds, she sees her whole body without a towel! That was the best scene of the whole movie because you see Sasquatch starring them, but in the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. Also, most deaths are off the screen and only the scream or the roar. And I expected the Sasquatch to die. But he did not shoot him and only 4 or 5 people died in the whole movie. I expected between 8 and 10 people to die. Do not watch this movie. I give it an F-. Do not waste your time.
