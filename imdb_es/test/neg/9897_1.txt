Well, to begin with, I was like, wow, this is new, so when the movie starts, and from here in between. But it never ended. The movie is just a big one in the middle! And after 10 minutes of waiting for something to really happen, apart from the splashing water, I started to get mad! There is nothing in this documentation and nothing will be learned. Totally boring and blond!
