I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 years old when I saw it. It's the only movie I've ever seen in the theater. My mom, dad and I looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole me about 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous. The whole premise was too deformed. Being 9, I always entertained easily. This movie showed that I could not submit to anything and still be entertained.
