DeCoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" who work today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with his films that generally contain homoeroticism and that the boys run in their boxing shorts. Remember ... anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck your blood / soul ... such deep symbolism here). I sat through The Sisterhood to give her just jolts, I try to see all the horror films I can and this one had Barbara (BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton (previously had been absorbed by the world of DeCoteau Thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses that I like). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what there is of The Sisterhood ... As the other critic pointed out, the alleged plot involves lesbian vampires on a university campus. But there has never been a parade of hot youngsters ("actresses" if you want) running dressed in bras, panties and bikinis so boring. The film has no plot, no gore, no nudity, and the dialogue is ridiculous and it seems that they were invented as they went along. The pieces are placed in slow motion and repeated many times to increase the operating time. About ten minutes of this consists of characters who simply walk around the campus (oh, the excitement!) That looks more like a hotel in a hotel than any university I've been to. And acting is the worst of the absolute. The only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend down to show their bodies. The cast was so devoid of talent that I would be surprised to see any of them get a day's role in Passion in the future. The same goes for the boys. Yes, DeCoteau also squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this ... Men who should be in some K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people really have to audition or just show up at Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I am willing to give an opportunity to any film if 1.) it is written intelligently, well directed, original and acted competently (or hell, even ambitious and stylish) .. O 2 .) is full of blood, naked, a variety of garbage and / or is definitely hilarious. David DeCoteau's films offer NONE of that and they do it with production values ​​better than the usual ones for direct to video films. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of pornography of the variety of software and hardware that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I just can not answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to give a unique twist to the genre. Instead, it produces nonsense that numbs the mind without shining an ounce of talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are anything but pro-gay. In fact, they make homosexuality seem sordid, secret and sinister. Obviously homosexual characters in his films always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill the innocent and sexually confused protagonists. There is no shadow here to do interesting things. The protagonists are naive and rarely appear strong, assertive or confident in who they are. I would understand this conspiracy if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura start making direct horror films to the video, but from a gay director, that shows that he almost does not think about these cheese festivals.
