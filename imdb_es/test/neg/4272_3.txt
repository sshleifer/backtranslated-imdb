I always try not to be severe while criticizing something that I did not like, but after watching this miniseries I was so disappointed that I could not avoid my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained true to the novel and, of course, I found them very beautiful, but on the other hand, a terrible casting, bad performance, especially of key characters? Like Funny Price, the impression of a play, I mean that the theatrical form of acting irritates you from beginning to end. I am sure that with this budget, even if it was low, something much better and valuable could have been done. It is up to you to watch this series, but I personally do not advise you to devote your time to this disappointing weathering.
