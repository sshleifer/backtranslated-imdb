Combining serious drama with proper comedy is delicate at best. IN SEARCH OF THE COMEDY IN THE WORLD Musulm√°n achieved it thanks to a current topic and a fantastic script; Not to mention the excellent character of Albert Brooks. But the man of the year can not approach in comparison. It has a messy message with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely incredible. <br /> <br /> The premise initially seemed very promising. Put a comedy news guy in the style of Jon Stewart for president of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful television character who is pressured to run by his audience. Along with him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Seeming to have very little chance of a successful career, Tom Dobbs wins the election amazingly. <br /> <br /> But did he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXELLER OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer expert from the company who designed the new software for electronic voting in polling stations. She finds a flaw in the system that is quickly swept away by the owner of the company and his obscure lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, DAY OF INDEPENDENCE). Prepared to lose billions of dollars if you know something about it, the evil men of the company decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure he never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to reach President-elect Dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the incredible love story also begins to blossom). Dobbs goes to Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, eliminating himself as the new president-elect and ending the careers of those who work in the computer company ... ah, and saving the life of Mrs. Green. <br />> Does any of this sound fun? Comedy is strongly embedded in the story and is often uncomfortable. Robin Williams burns for a few moments during a debate, but is quickly affected by the seriousness of how he became president. It confirms it. The message of the film is also interesting and debatable: that special interest has presidential candidates. I'm sure there's a substantial truth in this, and if you wanted to make a film about that, you could do it. If you wanted to do a comedy about you, you could. But the Man of the Year is not.
