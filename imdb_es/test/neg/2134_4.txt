A giant mutant squid "40 feet long" with five tentacles, razor fangs and the ability to reproduce its own cells terrifies a small town in Florida. Several marine biologists, doctors and police conspire to kill him. Meanwhile, a human monster named Miller hires people who discover the "Devil Fish" is a manmade creation that is used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller attacks an investigator, strangles her, drowns her in the bathtub, throws her in a hair dryer and then rips her panties off her body. <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are triggered when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob embarked on a high-tech "Seaquarium" boat (high technology for 1984) to catch the creature, whom it sees often in the high-speed movie or hilariously obvious to seem more threatening. And only fire can destroy it, leading to a gang armed with flamethrowers in front of an end of an aquatic beast. <br /> <br /> This JAWS cash is quite docile (apart from a legless corpse and a decapitation) but you can see and benefit from an excellent Antony Barrymore score and a decent monster design (again, for 1984). Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
