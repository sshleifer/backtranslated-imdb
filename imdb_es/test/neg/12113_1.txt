Foreword of my review stating that I am not a fan of the independent genre "straight to the video" that has a great debt to the movies of the 60s. I do not own any, I have never rented any, so I may lack the appreciation for these stinky and low budgets that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie in Cinemax late one Saturday night with a friend. Please, do not ask me why I was watching Cinemax on a Saturday night with a friend. We were bored with the World Championship Poker. An outrageous performance courtesy of Misty Mundae (and I wish she did not realize she was from Illinois, since we actually turned out some very brilliant actors here) caught our attention. Now, normally, the goal of a good soft-core porn would be to make you and your partner in the mood. Any good sex, ironic humor, and who knows what might happen? After about 15 minutes, and in a scene in which the title character seduces a robbery victim, my friend said: "If you want to see the rest of this fine, I'll go to bed so I do not have to." Please turn off the volume. ' This is what I infer from the plot: the character of Misty is a sexless nerd who is bitten by a spider and becomes a super sexual kitten with cobweb link powers that do not come from her wrists. There is some kind of evil evil involved, which did not look particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who is a man in this movie) constantly receives proposals from stereotyped gay bikers and, in some way, evil villainy is expelled from a building until his death. <br /> <br /> What was it? Well about this movie He finished. <br /> <br /> What was wrong? Acting to make a third grade contest look like the Oscar winners, a script created by people I imagine as drunks, college-age sexual perverts who would not know what sex is if they attended a class taught by Dr. Ruth, special Effects that were as special as someone who jumped from a trampoline, a humor as fun as? Well, I still have to find something that is slower. The sex scenes? If we were watching a video, the only thing that those scenes had been activated is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this type of movie is supposed to be enjoyed because of its inherent evil. Companies like EI do not intend to make good films: they have a niche and they go to it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are right about the money to serve their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe', I can say that I will not go into that world again in the future. Perhaps the problem with filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they pay so much attention to making movies bad, that if they try hard to focus on those things they do very well, they will be very nice. Cinema 'le bad', movies from La Troma in the 80s. Sorry friends; The spirit is there, but the effort is not. <br /> <br /> Even though I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me?
