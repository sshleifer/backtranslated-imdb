This sequel to the above, and the final entry in the series "Kharis", is a bit more pleasant in general, but it is also more artificial (hell, we even have a waitress / hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests we have seen during the course of these films, and Martin Kosleck, as his henchman, seems not to be interested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch, then, is charged with a ridiculous accent when the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later widely used character actress) gets her most substantial "role" and, in fact, the sequence of his resurrection of the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but of the whole series. Unfortunately, here too, Chaney has very little to do since, once again, the emphasis is on Ananka, as I said; his Mummy (to which he returned most often in Universal, apart, of course, from his characteristic role of The Wolf Man!) remains, without a doubt, his most memorable monster for study.
