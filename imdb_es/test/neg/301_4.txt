*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read a bit about Dahmer and saw the new Dahmer movie (with the same name) at a previous time. This film here focuses a lot on the victims and the murders, very little on Dahmer himself. The movie called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was very little about his crimes and too much about himself. <br /> <br /> I did not find the performance to my satisfaction, I had a certain amateur feeling too. , especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if Dahmer's performance got worse every time he played against the official parole actor. But I could be wrong about that. <br /> <br /> What bothered me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing, but that the filmmakers seemed to try to show "the real one" about what they did anyway. That's fine, but what I do not understand is why the guy who ran away from his apartment while Dahmer was drinking beer was not showing himself naked, since that's how it happened. It is not a big problem, but it is further away from the quality of the films, so that such details are omitted. What was not shown, or even really hinted, was the Dahmers' sexual obsession with the dead. Once again, I do not care that they did not show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or incorporated it in some way. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think Dahmer's very good film is still To be made, a film that incorporates not only Dahmers' crimes, but also who he was and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are not enough to understand the complexity of all this. This movie was just a clipping (excuse from the play on words) of the Dahmers' life and personality and does not give you a "close to the good" vision of your life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
