I loved this movie when I was a teenager. I loved. Although it has not grown with me. Maybe it's because it's a melodramatic burden of old garbage, full of macho postures, cheesy dialogues, exaggerated slo-mo and characters that say 'Damn it' a lot. The clumsy narrative bubbles without grace from one character to another, from one plot to another, without putting them all together, and it does not help that the mono expression of a William Baldwin performance is wet enough to put out all the shots in the film. execution time too long. It's worth seeing Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland, but no one is really at the top of their game here, and women get particularly short. The only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and the majestic Hans Zimmer score, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
