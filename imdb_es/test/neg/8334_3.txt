When the movie started I had the feeling that this was going to be something special. The acting and the camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathize with them. The movie had a good atmosphere and there was a touch of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, as the film progressed, the plot never seemed to take off and simply shot scene by scene. I could not understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was that the characters occasionally found each other and references to boats in bottles. Without that connection, I only had a few short stories left. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised you've done so well in Cannes.
