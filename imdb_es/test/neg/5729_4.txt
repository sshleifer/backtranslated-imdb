"Red Sonja" is defective, weak and lacking. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; The costumes (although Red Sonja's disguise is ridiculous, it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men, because she was raped, still chooses to wear very little clothes, even when it rains) and music. By Ennio Morricone. Even so, the film is something visible, but certainly not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they did not even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good sequences of action and some humor, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. The film is taken seriously and tries to impress, but fails completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a horrible protagonist. I do not know who the accent is worse; Of her or Arnie and on top of that; She can not act. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who acts more badly than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was a good thing in his role, but my God, he looked horrible, he changed a lot from his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Maybe it had something to do with his illness that claimed his life in 1991? And, by the way, what about all the actors in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in this movie? Along with Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared on a piece of paper, it looked like a kind of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" meeting. <br /> <br /> The only times the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword) fights, although some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> It is only really visible to fans of the fantastic genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
