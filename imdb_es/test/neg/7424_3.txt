A plane carrying employees of a large biotechnology company, including the CEO's daughter, plunges into a dense forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), gathers a small ragtag group to execute his own search and rescue mission. But what is it that Knowles is looking for and trying to rescue, and what is it that follows them and observes them in the forest? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a disaster this movie was! It was a shame, because, on the one hand, it's starring Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern-genre actors, and two, it could have been a decent movie. He suffers from two major flaws, and it's probably the fault of writer / director Jonas Quastel: this movie (which I'll call by his Sasquatch alias) has the worst edition I've seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and the constant advice Quastel for the cast seems to have been: "Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk about each other, improvise improvisers and generally try to be as annoying as possible." <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite the scam aspects (all the material related to the airplane crash was obviously trying to get rid of The Blair Witch Project (1999) and all the material related to the titular monster was attacking Predator (1987)), the exhibition of Ed Wood and the ridiculous dialogue. , the graph had promise and potential for more subtle subtexts and much less saccharine. The monster costume, once we got to see it, was more than enough for my taste. The mix of character types who walk through the woods could have been great if Quastel and also writer Chris Lanning had rejected the notch of the stereotype from 11 to at least 5 and would have spent more time exploring their relationships. The "den" of the monster had a nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations for a more primitive Creepers Jeepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogues that could have been easily effective. <br /> <br /> But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of false steps: for some reason, Quastel believes that it is a good idea to cut the dialogue scenes that occur in a matter of minutes with each other in time real so that, instead, we can see some lines from scene A, then some lines from scene B, then return to A, return to B, and so on. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to frequently use black screens between fragments of dialogues, whether we need the idea of ​​an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or irrelevant comments. The comments seem to be happening one after the other in time anyway. <br /> <br /> For some reason, it does not matter if the scenes were shot during the morning, the afternoon, the middle of the night, etc. It just cuts. to them at random. In this sense, the scenes shown appear to have been selected at random. Important events never appear or hardly appear, and we find ourselves with too many useless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he left a scene about rock art in the film when, or else, he needs more exposure to justify it. Get there, or you just have to get rid of it, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could easily have been shown otherwise). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a complete character - Mary Mancini - left in the script even though it is superfluous. <br /> <br /> For some reason, suddenly we go to an extremely soft porn scene, even though the motive never repeats itself. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the characters are still calling Harlan Knowles "Mr. H", as if they were stereotypes of Asian domestic people. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using "Blurry Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" for the monsters' attack scenes, even though the suit does not look so bad, and it would have been a lot More effective put some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else that is not bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie more than me. I'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the scenery, I love hiking and this is basically a trekking movie on one level, but I could not. Every time he thought he was going to be "better from this point to the end," Quastel made some other terrible move. In the end, my score was 3 out of 10.
