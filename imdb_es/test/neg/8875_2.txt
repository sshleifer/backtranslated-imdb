I did not even see this whole movie. Now, I like the science fiction films of the 50s, even when they are quite inaccurate, but this one only bothered me. On the one hand, a member of the crew on the spacecraft talks and acts as if he had managed to enter the tenth grade. It looks like it should be in a bowling league, not a spaceship. Through the window of the spacecraft, the crew marvels at Earth and this teat says: "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another guy says 'Claro'. And the tit says 'Gee, I wonder who is throwing'. Forgive me for a moment, I think my sides are dividing. <br /> <br /> When they go into orbit for the first time, the tit says' The moon is just to look! Take me back! Seeing the crew make stretched mouths and shout from the G forces of acceleration during takeoff is not one of the best moments of the film. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie can be identified by a large "EL FINAL" on the screen). <br /> <br /> We also discovered that they can not open the hatch because the 'teta' greased it before Claro took off, a space vehicle will be "greased" by a member of the crew, which we later discovered has never had a space suit before and does not know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey, the cartoon fat duck, said: "That sounds logical!" The effects of non-gravity in space are so bad that it is painful to see them. (Everyone knows that, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go UP). <br /> <br /> How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other, much higher films do not qualify higher, it's a mystery to me. I really like the old science fiction movies, but this one is not realistic, and the unconvincing attempts to make humor with the characters throwing that tit from a fat pit at a gas station do not work at all, they simply ruin the movie. I think in hindsight it's not so much the whole movie that I hate so much for the fact that 'the tit' is not so obviously someone who would be on a spaceship, not even to 'grease the hatch'. OMG. I wonder if he also checked the fan belts. Maybe if they had left 'teta' out of the trip, it might not have been VERY QUIET. Even so, it's just average. I do not know what the whole world is about. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good space movie from the 50s? 'Rocketship X-M' overcomes everything to the devil. Maybe not so much "realism" but a more serious story and fewer silly characters.
