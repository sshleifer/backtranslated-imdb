Drifting in the bootlegs, I sometimes thought I was a legend of urban comics, the first FF movie is as bad as everyone fears. I guess Marvel Comics now pretends it does not exist, as it happened with the 2005 version in theaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad and low-budget Marvel superhero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most of the television movies). "Under budget" is too easy a description for this picture of FF. Basically, due to the lack of funds, showing the powers of the super quartets was limited to very fast shots (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch) and fades (Invisible Girl, the easiest way to do). The Thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; The part of the face was especially almost convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are fine, although Jay, like Johnny, behaves like a spaz sometimes to show his "fiery" character. The dialogue is comic style, and it is the cast of support that ends up fighting to make it work. Dr. Doom is too melodramatic and involuntarily comical, and his two main henchmen are a case study on how not to act or write dialogues. <br /> <br /> The plot? No good. It was fairly true to the FF's origin story (more so than the later big budget version), and although the non-budget, once again, restricted by showing, for example, the actual forced landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how They discovered their powers in an isolated area: it is the best part of the image, although you have to wait half an hour to get it. I also found the rare music in some places; When the 4 are bathed in these cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is useless. Even without a budget, the story could have been without the character of Jeweler (similar to Mole Man's villain of the books); he spends too much time with him and his clandestine gang, as well as blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climatic fight with Doom and its men begins well, but it degenerates in a terrible disaster when the Torch executes a laser beam (a great animation but that belongs to a cartoon). Fans can laugh at the bad story of FF FX and a clever story, if they do not get depressed and get outraged first.
