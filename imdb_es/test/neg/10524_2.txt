The worst movie I've seen, and I've seen a lot. Acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the idea is terrible, and no investigation was done, what ever! Ok, I admit, 'Air Bud' was a pretty good movie, but not 'Soccer Dog'. This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10 year olds it will not be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to break the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, do not watch this movie.
