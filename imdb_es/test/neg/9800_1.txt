Once upon a time, in the 1940s, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful and talented young woman who once had a great demand for many large-budget Hollywood photos. Fast forward to the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and bad luck have tarnished everyone's favorite actress. Now, a Miss Lake has decided that the time has come to follow in the footsteps of her companions (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and fall back into the good reliable Horror. But the feast of the flesh? Really? She could not have been so washed. To put it mildly, Flesh Feast is a lifeless pile garbage, possibly one of the 5 worst movies I've seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist who is conspiring with Nazi's to bring Hitler back to life, with juvenile restoration experiments with worms, that's right, worms. Unless you're a huge Heather Hughes fan, run away and never look back! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this person from Veronica Lake, as well as from the movies of the 40s, but to think that such a successful career actually became so depressing, is actually quite sad. The Feast of the flesh is almost impossible to cross, and almost, I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of photos of Nudist Camp, and the man who, coincidentally, brought us the best B movie ever made, Blood Freak, just a couple of years later. One has to ask, is this what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter had not co-directed with Steve Hawkes? If so, then God bless Steve Hawkes. You would not think a Turkey monster, religious and drug-craving, could be SO BETTER than the experiments with Maggots and Hitler, but it really is. So forget that you ever heard about this and go find Blood Freak, just waiting to entertain you. Fast forward a couple of years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, breaks and forgets. The end. I hate you, feast of the flesh. 1/10
