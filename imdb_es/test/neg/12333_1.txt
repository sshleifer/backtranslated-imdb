The worst movie I've ever seen. The quality of the sound was bad, the cut of the scenes was even worse and, above all, it was not logical and had no speed ... <br /> <br /> First I said: "Oh No, I do not want the trail that prove that poor Patrick was an innocent murderer. " But this turned out to be even worse. Usually, in this American movie you get a super suggestion or no suggestion. I want very small little clues that lead you to the killer. The audience is not involved. And now, when I get no clue at all, you can expect several sweeps of 'he / she-is-the-murderer' at the end. And that's not all. ah ... This is hopeless, let's end with this ... <br /> <br /> In a word: disgusting .. <br /> <br />
