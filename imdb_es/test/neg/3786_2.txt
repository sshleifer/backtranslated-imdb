The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is its title: an anagram that is almost also a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, since in Britain "anemic" is spelled differently. <br /> <br /> I have always found that the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts are deeply pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographies (which he invented by accident and which are simply direct contact photographs), his only real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to represent female nudity in a way that was accepted as art and not as art. . That as porn But surely this had to happen over time, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> In the early 1960s, the second season of 'The Twilight Zone' opened each episode with a shot of rotating concentric circles. in black and white. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' that is very similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a spiral in black and white. In fact, if there was ever a film that deserves to be described as a spiral, it is. Throughout 'Anemic Cinema', we receive (?) Shots of a rotating disc containing words (in French) that move in a spiral. The effect is vertiginous, and the texts, about incest and eskimos, are almost given in their lack of meaning. I made fun of an intelligent word game. <br /> <br /> The emperor is naked, friends, and this movie barely qualifies 2 out of 10 points. See you later!
