This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. There is no fragment of historical precision, in fact, reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan took advantage of the few ethnic Chinese he encountered. The performance is exaggerated, the script is a badly written lie. I've never seen worse fake beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and, reportedly, would only make the film if the script was completely rewritten so he could be a hero. Since the script was invented on the fly, it can explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is. <br /> <br /> Any movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
