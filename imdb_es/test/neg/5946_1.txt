Amigos is a "comedy" about a man whose parents ask him to kill them because they are becoming senile and want to be taken out of their misery. Several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from their deadly traps at the last moment and losing one of the parts of his body each time the process is performed. The film seems to hate its main character, which makes it more painful to watch. There is also the habitual love interest and predictable final. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember that his shaved upper lip looked strange and made me feel a bit slippery. But this could have been only because of the terrible premise and the boring execution of the film.
