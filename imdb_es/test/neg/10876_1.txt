Or that's what the filmmakers would like them to believe, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to make it so hard to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything, from the aspect of the film, cinematography, editing, dialogue and acting, is oriented in a super cool way from the beginning. Just to make sure no one misses how great this movie is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a western-surf-tex mex guitar that plays constantly throughout the movie. As a last reminder of how great this film is, all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, that is rough. <br /> <br /> The plot (if it exists) one) seems quite simple. But as someone else pointed out, the director and the star of the film, seems fiercely determined not to tell that story, instead focusing on a lot of naked girls and dialogues that are supposed to be rough, but tires surprisingly fast. A quiz to see how many times you could put the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and their derivatives in an 80-minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely horrible.
