This was one of the most dishonest, pointless and non-peaceful movies I've ever seen. The representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward and unjust. On the one hand, the song that was heard on the radio of the E.S car when it stopped next to a very right-wing Israeli pilot was "I write you a spell" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I've even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and slang) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason for an Israeli Jew to be offended or angry by a nearby car that plays that song. The E.S. form he seems so calm and collected with his sunglasses and his cold gaze, through a long and still shot, is meant to force the viewer to see the Jew as emaciated and racist, and E.S. as noble and temperate. <br /> <br /> I have traveled all over Israel, and I have never seen an IDF recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruiting poster, but it shows a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "Do you want to shoot?" This is an extremely inaccurate description of the mentality of most Israelis, as well as Israeli soldiers, and such an "announcement" would not even exist on a random Israeli road. By including it, the director tries to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists that is determined to kill. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was gratuitous and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting at Palestinians would be as disgusting in an Israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, the images of an unrealistic, non-comic and violent scenario manage to provoke applause from the audience, since the director has defamed the Israeli side so long in advance that any shooting of dead Israeli soldiers would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt to build bridges, to portray the "other" as human or to work for peace; Violence is made to be the only solution. This is favored by scenes of tanks in explosion, towers of guard that fall and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli army, and the targets in the shooting ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other almost civilian on the canvas. The soldiers at the checkpoints are instructed not to shoot at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; The method, according to my friend, is to issue a warning cry, shoot in the air or around the area, and then, if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. Arbitrarily attacking a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the management style was also deficient. The repetition became repetitive, and he no longer captivated. The symbols, such as the globe with Arafat drawn on it, are forced out of any frame structure or effective integration into the environment; The globe is Palestine that penetrates and recovers Jerusalem, and is created without any reason by E.S. The fact that Israeli soldiers verify the ambulance permits followed by the subsequent Israeli ambulances flying by the checkpoint is a too-open affirmation of a double standard Israeli director. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth as lugubrious and meaningless is done excessively; show the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasize that no cast member smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams the purpose of such scenes, the sadness of life, without leaving much margin for personal interpretation. By contrasting a "section" of the film, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this sadness on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence of why Guilt may be appropriate. I discussed. <br /> <br /> I spent hours trying to figure out why the music ended abruptly and abruptly, and why many modern fashion tracks and metal shows were included in the score. I still can not give an answer. I felt that the music was out of place in this movie; The contrast between the quieter scenes and the intense scenes was really annoying and did not affect or provoke reflection. I can understand if the director intended music to give some comic aspects to certain scenes, but I discovered that there was nothing funny about Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting against a ninja, or that a woman had to undergo another step. A checkpoint, although in a challenging way. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during the intense scenes, and I was disturbed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. Whatever the director's intention, it only provided an auditory dislike throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This film does not have a legitimate political message because it provides an extreme and inaccurate representation of the other, and refuses to address any problem. It is a propaganda film, because the director tries several symbols, styles and scenes to attract sympathy on the Palestinian side, while showing the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of a Hollywood scene full of action or intense music is shown in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, so that the almost inevitably positive and excited feelings that music and filmmaking provoke in the audience are oriented to one side. There is no thought, reflection or deepening in the understanding of the conflict on the part of the audience; Emotions simply move aside and stay there, in a clich√© scenario "good versus bad". I think that this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee".
