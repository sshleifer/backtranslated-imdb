A bad basketball movie. A brusque coach with a dubious background arrives at a small Indiana high school basketball team in the 1950s and trains the boys to victory by "defeating them first and then training them." <br /> <br /> Not bad. topic. Photography ok But the plot is totally predictable. There are no real sub-plots. Nothing added to make the movie exciting. You know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for fourth grade students.
