It's been a long time since my wife and I saw such a boring thriller. It is definitely NOT an exciting story and it moves so slowly that we almost fell asleep. This could be, on the other hand, a series of very low budget television crimes. There are some ridiculous scenes like that in which the boss of the mafia, Pirano, wants to see the lady of the jury in red clothes or another mobster who can not stop to think about her, etc. Well, maybe this should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me you really do not miss anything. We gave 4/10.
