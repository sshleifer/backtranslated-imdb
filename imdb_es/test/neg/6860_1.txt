I enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and endured some bad actors in badly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode that presents the disappearance of Mr Echos had so many scenes drawn with persistent close-ups of bad acting that I found myself pressing the fast forward button. This episode was highlighted so far by far the worst. In fact, the variation in the quality of Lost has been so inconsistent, I often wonder how many writers are using it. <br /> <br /> I will keep watching but I hope things get better and I hope to stop wishing in secret for the sub-par actors in the series to die.
