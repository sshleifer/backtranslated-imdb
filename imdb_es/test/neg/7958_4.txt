Deepa has tried once again to bring up a subject that nobody wants to talk about. The story is fine, the cinematography is exceptional, the script and acting are well below average. I guess it's the fault of the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where their original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in a totally different cast. Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Current actors Lisa Ray (who is good at squirming in the sheets of Bombay Dyeing) and John Abraham are pathetic, they need basic lessons to act. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the film as much as they can. The boy had done an exceptional job. The editing and the flow of the movie is not something I would have expected from Deepa either. A big issue, sends a strong message about a practice that is still widespread in rural India but does not meet the standards that Deepa established for her in Fire and Earth. Watch it once ... when it's on DVD, do not bother paying $ 10 to watch it ... well, beat the average Hindi movie anytime
