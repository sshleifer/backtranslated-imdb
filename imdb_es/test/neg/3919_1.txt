The square pigs as a way to efficiently use the cargo space is the only intelligent moment in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper has done worse, see "The American Way", but this movie is very high on the "cream of shit" scale. I think the best way to describe the visual experience is that "the truckers of space" will not please anyone. Too caricature can also be taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor and poor development of the characters practically ensure disappointment. People with beer and popcorn can tolerate a visit, but everyone else has been warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all the above reasons. - MERK
