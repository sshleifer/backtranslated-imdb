I admit that I was captivated by the provocative photos of Charlotte Lewis of this film, as well as a comment on the IMDb forum dedicated to her, which she describes as "a great underestimated movie". And so I got, with great difficulty, my own copy of "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> What a waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing more than a film of blood and blood made cheaply with a ridiculous premise that I will not even repeat, with several telegraphic sequences (for example, when we see Lewis feeding his fish with Honey, we know immediately what will happen later). Not even Lewis can save this movie with his beautiful black hair, his big and luminous brown eyes, his thick and full lips and his impressive figure. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist" or even "Golden Child".
