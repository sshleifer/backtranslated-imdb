I bought this movie in a thrift store. Months before, my friend told me when we were talking about silly movies we've seen. Once I saw the cassette, I knew I had to have it. I saw it that night. I realized that it was going to be very cheesy and cheap. . . That's what attracted me to that. I put it in and I laughed all the time. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Cream Man), but I did not recognize his name and he could not remember where I saw him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith Show, he introduced Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) as an extra since he is the brother of Ron Howard (Opie Taylor). I saw the credits and I was breathless. I went to my mother, who was also watching the program, and I said: "That's the Ice Cream Man!" She also gasped. This movie is great, but only for laughter and criticality. It is the perfect example of a corny horror movie. If you feel like laughing and making fun of low budget movies, rent this video.
