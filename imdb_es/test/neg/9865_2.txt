Yes! This film was bad in all aspects, like the cast, the effects, the boredom, the emotion and, of course, for being fantastic. We all know that the four heroes of this movie were a little more colorful compared to the new ones, but still have to. Wow, a fantastic hole like this was really stupid that I knew nobody would like when I saw it, surely with that budget they could have done 3 or 4 GOOD movies, but no. I'm glad that the new version made this year showed everyone how the fantastic four should have done with a good story, an excellent cast as Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses. Otherwise, it would have been totally forgotten, but fortunately not. The new one was excellent when I saw it with my colleagues in the cinema, but this fantastic old hole has to go.
