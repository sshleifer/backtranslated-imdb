** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably appears is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and conspiracy movies like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Faced with the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide, round lake in California. At first, the film has some dazzling underwater photographs (for the budget) and creates some ambience in spite of itself. Then it degenerates into a windy dialogue uttered by nameless actors with expired Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipes. At one point, the campers sing "Take the high road, I take the low road", just to throw another Scottish cliché. If the Scots ever decide to get on the Political Correction bandwagon, they will sue Larry Buchanan for this movie, despite his last name. The monster looks like a giant papier-mâché puppet and makes the dragon in Beanie and Cecil look frightening in comparison. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie takes to the ground and, to evade some soldiers patrolling, the fifty-foot-long creature tries to hide behind a tree, and the soldiers do not see it! THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a true hallucinatory that must be seen, several times, to be believed.
