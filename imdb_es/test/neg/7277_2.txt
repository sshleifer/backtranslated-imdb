The hills have eyes is not a great movie at all of the imagination. For one, the villains seem almost normal, is not what you would expect crazy madmen to see. For others, the rhythm is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves. With that, I mean there's a lot of filler in the movie, with a lot of running aimlessly. The film did not have a clear direction. The plot of the film is not original, even for its The massacre of Texas saws came out a few years ago and is a much more effective film, as far as horror is concerned. The film has little fear, and the strong soundtrack only served to annoy and distract everyone. Once. I suppose the music was used to hide the fact that not much happens through much of the movie, although it failed in its intended purpose. Basically, I kept looking at the time every few seconds waiting for something to happen or end. when something finally happened some promise The movie was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise. I sat through it because I like to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. Yes, there are some loud cries, and yes, people die, but who cares. Very slow get to any kind of reward, if you can call it that. My friend enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something. The hills have eyes is not the worst movie we could have seen, but I doubt I'll see it again. This film was remade in 2006 and will also have a revision of that version. Anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while others were chaotic and repetitive. Unless you like to see the paint dry, occasionally someone running around your block intervenes, screaming head, stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original massacre of Texas (1973) 1.5 * of 10 * which is to be generous
