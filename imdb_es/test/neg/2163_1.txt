The cybernetic zone, since this DVD was sold in Oz, is the worst grade B garbage I have seen. In addition to Singer's expressionless, moderate act, which indicates that he knew how bad the film was going to be, the other actors are inclined towards genuine attempts to deliver line (Swanson and Quarry) or the absurd imitations of classic movie scenes . Mathius Hues makes the most dying representation of dying from Jim Carrey's Mask. All this without a real thread that suggests an attempt to falsify by gender, period or any common vein is simply annoying. Do not even try to connect the dots with the plot. It's Blade Runner, slightly disguised without content, actors or stage due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never more apparent. Repeatedly there is an annoying reuse of limited series, without paying attention to the preparation of the bandage and a flurry of special effects that would have hit the floor of the cutting room for Dr. Who in 1976. The explosion of the helicopter is worthwhile. I'm sorry to rewind to prove my point. Of course, there are masochists who will accumulate this trip, but if you are watching this movie for a bet, be sure to get more than your payment rate. At $ 2 this DVD will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster.
