Holy crap, the beginning started where the first one left (good start). Then it goes downhill from there. It seemed like you were watching TV and you kept switching between this teenage soap opera, a Predator movie and a fucking detective show. The characters that appear in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the real story of Alien). <br /> <br /> Then, by the end, the producers were running out of money quickly and decided to finish the film, so they decided to launch a nuclear weapon on the city. approached can not say what is happening? Seriously, the filmmakers do a good job with fight scenes and get to where we can see the fight.
