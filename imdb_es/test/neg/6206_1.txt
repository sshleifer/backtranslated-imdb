This is not a good movie. It is a proven remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But it insults the original. This is not an expected film from a veteran director like 'David Dhawan', who has the credit of directing good films like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... <br /> <The main theme of this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes to attract the Indian audience, but somehow the story and the script are not convincing enough. In addition, the performance of the main roles, that is, Salman Khan and Govinda is regrettable. It seems that they need the least provocation to take off their shirts to reveal their bare chest. I do not consider this fascinating and less comical. What was the director thinking? Added to this, the spectators have to support the case of Govinda's excess of performance. It was simply unbearable. I advise viewers to watch it at their own risk. My rating of 2 for this movie could be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would recommend that viewers watch the English movie "Hitch", which is much better.
