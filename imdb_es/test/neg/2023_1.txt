Considering that they wanted to make a vampire movie in space, I thought: "Well, it will probably be pretty corny, but at least interesting enough to see a different version of the whole genre." Whoops. I do not care what kind of movies you like; even if you are the greatest vampire, terror, suspense or suspense fan of the world, or in an adverse way, if you have never seen a horror movie before and expect your first one to be awesome in any way ... you are wrong I have never seen a movie "made for television" or special for after school so bad. I've never seen such a bad pilot program. I've never seen images of animals sleeping or shitting as bad as this. This is, by far, the biggest waste of hours that could otherwise happen when contemplating the importance of kitchen towels and their effect on your life. I would rather be stuck in a bathroom for weeks without anything to consume, except my own urine and excrement, than to see even a single clip of this movie again. Seeing this made me want the fate of the characters instead of trying to know that I paid money to see it. However, it was like a train crash: so bad that he could not help but look, hoping something good could happen. Did not do it Please, for God's sake, if you or your friends, even if you use illicit substances while doing it, even consider watching this movie, instead, opt for a contest to see who can shoot a snot rocket further away. It will bring you much greater enjoyment and entertainment.
