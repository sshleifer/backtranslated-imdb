A strange and deliberately biography of Dyan Thomas in which we heard a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure an exhibition of raw characters through the prism of their protobasa relationship with the wife (Sienna Miller) and the love of childhood (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent interest, and Cillian Murphy invents the persistently tense plug. <br /> <br /> The movie never seems to decide where it is going. There is no arch as much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female protagonists (who does not?) Than in the man who unites them and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found that Knightley was competent at best, but I never found her understanding), but both offer Welsh accents that are terribly inconsistent. Other amusing decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy), the artistic production (for example, cross-fused doubles) that is neither impressionistic nor symbolic and the ancient brown-haired act of archival material of the era that does not match. 4/10
