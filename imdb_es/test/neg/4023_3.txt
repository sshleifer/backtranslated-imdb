The original story had all the ingredients to make a totally captivating movie. But it failed miserably in this version, since even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what should be, so much so that I suspected that she must become an accomplice until the end. Did Sherlock Holmes become a warrior very different from everything Sir Arthur Conn Doyle suggested? In fact, it was Dr. Watson who showed the little common sense that was happening. The blackened boot of the Andoman Islands looked like it could not come out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing drinking tea on Baker Street for a denouement was something more than anything that the old Scotland Yard could have imagined. So send this movie to your Black Museum for television, please.
