Talk about a snoring. This third category biker movie was sleeping me as soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen. The shame is that the cast included many excellent actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. , this is basically the story of a former US Army with a green beret (Henriksen) trying to get someone to help get rid of a gang of creepy bikers in a city of one horse. is at the elementary level. Sad to see the winner of a Kennedy Academy award at a time so deranged by his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, this would be a perfect movie video to rent .......... you'll be sleeping instantly!
