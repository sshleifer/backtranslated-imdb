I rarely see a movie with such a cast, a story potentially so strong and based on a great-selling book that has been so weak and, to some extent, indecipherable ... <br /> <br /> The premise A story is read as a Brent Easton Ellis novel: many drugs, despair and self-induced tragedy when a young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to cope with being a suicidal loser, who seems unable to accept that in reality is living a good life. Life and that, basically, is pathetic for being so baby ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci not only plays a tragic person, but also a tragic actress, whose sobs and screams during most of the movie. it really makes you want to scream: kill yourself and roll the credits ... The director is useless, since it does not provide any rhythm and the story feels so disjointed that you have no idea what it is really doing This damn girl about. The director apparently was in Prozac when he directed this imitation of a film and, therefore, he left it on automatic pilot, which made it an unbearable disaster. <br /> <br /> The only redeemable features are a nice Jason Biggs, like Wurtzel's boyfriend (who fortunately decided to get rid of the egocentric self-centered self-indulgent and an incredibly good Jessica Lange as the mother of weeping babies. , Lange can not be defeated by a terrible script, direction and terrible co-actors, pure class. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is really what Wurtzel is or was, but the film has left me totally disinterested in his writings. <br /> <br /> In the end I finished watching this movie and instantly I started thinking: OK, it's time to see something, that it's really REAL problems ...
