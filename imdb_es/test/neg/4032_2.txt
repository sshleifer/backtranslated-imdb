I realize from the other comments that NO ONE could really enjoy this bit of shit, that's how I felt. <br /> <br /> All the time I was watching it, I was horrified that someone could make a movie. This stupid. What's the world? I guess it's my fault that I was sitting for the whole movie (hey!) But it was like a bad car accident, I could not look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8 years old, you may like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from her at all costs. It's the stupidest movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid, the story, the script and, above all, the acting, everything! While watching the movie, either turn off the TV and think "how sad a movie can be so stupid", or continue to look out of curiosity, to see if things can be more stupid than this (they can not). <br /> <br /> These movie creators (if you can call them that) must return seriously to their day jobs, none of them have an ounce of talent, and I doubt very much that they can make a living producing such garbage! horrible and useless that no one in their right mind would want to see! <br /> <br /> Simply extracted BS Do not waste your time.
