There's something in a movie that features women bodybuilders who put me in front of the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I have seen "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk", and even the TV movie "Getting Physical", which included some important names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own way (mainly because they introduced Rachel McLish, ROWWR!). <br /> <br /> Then I went and observed "Nemesis III: Prey Harder", on the only basis that I had such luminaries as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love the ladies, I always will, but after that I'm glad I lost the first two "Nemesis" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the first, anyway. Most of the images here are raised bodily (and I suppose that kicks and screams) of "Nemesis II". Actually, that aspect seemed slightly entertaining because of the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But even though Price and the company are flexing and posing, they do not have many opportunities to do something else (like, for example, ACT). !). In fact, this entire film is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha ...) in oblique narrations, ambiguous characters and open films (both in terms of filming and history). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes much sense, but even if it did, there would still be problems, such as making such small parts for women as big as this one. What a crime <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect? Cohesion? <br /> <br /> A star only, in consideration for all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put into their bodies, NOT the "artisanal" work done within the film itself. <br /> <br /> Thanks, ladies.
