If you ever want a really terrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could be compared to this. I have spent a lot of time watching many terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get, and this is one of the worst. This movie was so bad that I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That was not so bad, which is amazing since it went straight to the video. This is one of those movies that is hard to understand how it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had to have read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several drafts) and said, "Yes, that's it, there's some money here." In fact, they probably just wanted to do a Beastmaster 2 before they had a script, and then they went with what they had. Ack, horrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, look at this one. It's a true classic, and the movie does not get worse than this. And if you do, please let me know.
