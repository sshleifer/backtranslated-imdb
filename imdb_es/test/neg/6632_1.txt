This should not have been done in a movie. Everything was idiotic and I do not think I've laughed even once. There were fragments that were fine, I suppose, but that's it. Many parts were surprisingly similar to many other movies that made them much better. There were some famous actors / actresses in this, but nobody did a good job, they just should not have cared. This is one of those movies that tries to have a "cute" ending but it was so idiotic that it literally did not have redeeming values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian there is now. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this! <br /> <br /> Final decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely not! <Br /> <br /> Rent: only if you have seen EVERYTHING else and you have a free coupon, but still not worth it.
