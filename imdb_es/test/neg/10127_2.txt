I might think that a program about regular teenagers with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept, for example: the main characters have a great secret that they hide from their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and That So Raven. Next, the performance is simply average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep in many scenes. Finally, the jokes are clich√© or boring. If they are not using, they are colorful, but strange dialogues to make us "laugh", are throwing various accessories around the room. I really want this show to use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
