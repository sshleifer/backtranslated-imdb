2001 is one of those movies in which, if you do not like it, you are told that you do not "understand" it and you need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. He is told that he clearly has a slow attention span, and he only wants to see sex, explosions and give him the plot on a tray. <br /> <br /> We're going to analyze the movie, okay? Three minutes of darkness, with something that sounds like a dying hippopotamus in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the savannah. Then, a group of monkeys finds a black rock and begins to kill things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of boats doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A group of meaningless dialogues and a group of lunar scientists find another monolith. <br /> <br /> Cut to a spaceship that is too long for the complement of the crew: three people asleep, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only a little more personality than the rigid ones in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that runs the ship. Predictably, he breaks and begins to break the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. A super evil and coldly ruthless mind that controls the environment and can predict every movement. And what does He let a man float in space and turn off the hibernation machines so that the three sleeping men die, leaving Dave floating in a capsule. Simply use the airbag, put on a space suit and turn off the HAL in a dying and slow way. Then, apparently, there is a psychedelic "evolution" in Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is the movie with the breaks taken: the monkeys see monoliths, they kill things. Scientists find the monolithic moon. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a prerecorded message and evolves on Jupiter. <br /> <br /> This is not me 'I do not understand'. This is me bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I do not have to worry. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, each character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.
