The worst I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is pure garbage. All things are wrong in this movie. The direction, the script, the arts, the cinematography, the cast or anything else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a child. He has to be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role seems to be 30 years old, and he is a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> The edition tries to save it, but with that very bad material in the hands, they can not work miracles. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is poor, the text is poor, that does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned to "not do" a movie.
