This latest installment of the "Airport" franchise was so incredibly horrible that it took me a while to realize that it was not really a slapstick comedy, like "Airplane." George Kennedy firing a flare gun through an open window to deflect missiles in search of heat was comical. What would happen to your hand if you held it by a window at a speed of two mach? You would lose control of the weapon and break your arm. The passengers were, unintentionally, hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman who acted reluctantly George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy when she came to Ernest Borgnine. It will not happen Susan Blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. Neither did Robert Wagner. This movie was so bad that it seemed surreal.
