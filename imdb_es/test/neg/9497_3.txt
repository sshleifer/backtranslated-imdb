I love the distinctive and literate narrative of Ustinov. And the photography is pretty calm. We put the film for our 3.5 year old son who came in and left the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about a third of the movie and we were delighted. When we looked again, sitting for family time, we were all mortified by the violence and life-threatening situations in which the poor otter was found. In the middle of the movie, there is a shelf of dead and bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little. Then, in the end, there is a wild fight with a dog, then the blood clouds the water. One would think that, given G's rating, that's all you'll see ... that one of the dead animals will INVOLVE. They do not drag the corpse out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatic seconds. Personally, as an adult I love horror movies and I'm fine with the violent films of Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love the ultra violent Battle Royale. But those are not children's films and they are not advertised as such. If you raise your little ones deliberately to see the harsh realities of the life of cute animals, this is the movie for you. However, if you are like me and my wife, you may want to save your child nightmares and avoid this one.
