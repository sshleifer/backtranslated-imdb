"The Duke" is a film based on the heart of the British aristocracy where an old duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his great property and the vast riches that will be snatched by two devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Hey man) ; He passes his Dukeship to his dog. The "best friend" of the dog, an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die is orphaned by the ex-Duke because he is his great-uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte who connect instantly creating a romantic secondary plot that, in its way, acts as the low tone of the main plot, which are the activities of Hubert, the 'Duke' and his many Activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is guarded by James Doohan, who plays a butler who is determined to try to serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new teacher, Hubert. Doohan acts as the oldest character there to comfort and counsel the younger ones while he watches and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new teacher. A good comedy performance mixed with elements of drama to finish the career of a fine and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although from the technical point of view, I do not like this movie because I only watched the role of James Doohan. Although the plot is good, the elements of the writing and the direction must be hidden. Ignoring the absurdity of a "Doggie Duke", I personally dislike the excessive use of comic and scandalous jokes about the "bad" characters because of their ridiculousness. The dependence of the humor related to hygiene that you want is too evident and the general stupidity of many characters does not appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink, often uses long shots, either with an over-recorded voice or that affects the overall sound quality. In addition, the performance of Muirhead and Heyman, while good in the dramatic and romantic sequences, are drastically short and meet the general requirements of the role. <br /> <br /> But, as a fan of mature movies, I find it easy to be critical with a simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I found some funny bits and other bits that are played along with a plot that may be unlikely, but that has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans, but I do recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a fun movie for their son and James Doohan fans who want to see Scotty in his role final.
