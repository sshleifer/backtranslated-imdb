Danny is more than sorry. <br /> <br /> Keep making the same mistakes and it is no longer interesting to see it. At first I could feel for him, as an addict to myself. My heart was with him at the beginning, and at some point on the line he passed the line. It is almost as if he continues with this behavior to keep the program going, and at the same time he is seriously risking his life and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It's hard to even feel sorry for the poor boy. I think you need to see this program, maybe then you might have the opportunity to save this marriage. I can not understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I keep wondering how much is just to show, and how much is love. Danny, get a life - a new one that is! ... and do not make me start with Dr. Gary. What's wrong with him and his face? Your skin looks as if it is stretched to the fullest. Besides that, appearance does not mean anything, however, it seems that it is not particularly impartial. I think he is also making this continue for his own monetary gain and, often, not in the best interests of Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and each one reminds me of a dog that chases its tail. sad, very sad. Let's get together.
