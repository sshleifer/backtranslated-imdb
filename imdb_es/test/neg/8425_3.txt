After reading so many brilliant reports of 'To serve you all my days', I went out and bought it for Christmas. A waste of money, I'm afraid. I expected something in the same league as 'Brideshead Revisited' and some of the few other big productions on British television, but it's definitely not among them. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, wrapped in a very predictable plot with the most trite and flashy script I've heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. The main actor is interesting, especially due to his strange resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), only dark. But his undoubted talents are wasted on a character that is unbearably important and cunning. His sting is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during the First World War. He performs the first episodes, centered around his nervous condition, better than when he touches the gossip and socialist bienaventurador. <br /> <br /> Women are completely incredible, like in real life. His first wife is annoying and cheerful, the bride, the perfect and sophisticated whore, and the last lady a hodgepodge of political pomp. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, called Hobarth, I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The preaching of the script is the typical Andrew Davies, screenwriter, in his early years, and he becomes bored in the first two episodes (this miniseries has 11 episodes!). For episode 4, I just wanted to get over the damn thing. <br /> <br /> The music is equally tedious, limited mainly to a piano melody and a choir sung by children during the credits. No expense was spared in the configuration of the location, which provides some visual relief to an otherwise unbearable visual experience. <br /> <br /> As a rule, I like stories of this kind, and I am very disappointed by the complex nature of this series. . If you want to see something fascinating about WW1 and its side effects, there are many other much better vehicles to rent or buy. One of those that comes to mind is "The Unknown Soldier" of 1998. The characters in that Masterpiece Theater presentation are real and fascinating and move, unlike the two-dimensional puppets in "To serve them all my days." Regarding movies in male schools, bet on "Goodbye Mr Chips" or "Tom Brown's Schooldays". <br /> <br /> I know this goes against the favorable overview of this miniseries, but I recommend thinking twice before disbursing $ 80.00 for Acorn Media for its set of 4 DVDs, two of which in my set They had insurmountable problems with freezing and jumping.
