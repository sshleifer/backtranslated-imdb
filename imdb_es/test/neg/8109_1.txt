There could be some SPOILERS ahead, but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script of this movie overcame the shredder. It is awful. Completely unwrapped I stayed there for 45 minutes (approximately half the execution time) and I could not take it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the '90s (see "The War") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's changes from bubbly to serious this year (see "Chasing Freedom", which is surprisingly entertaining). I have seen fragments of "Run Lola Run". So with three tracks I liked this should have been fine. It was not Nobody had a good performance. Jones de Wood was flat. For an aspiring writer, he had almost no imagination (his violent fantasies seemed to have been ripped from "A Christmas Story" and his lustful were, uh, a cross between boring and alarming). Powerful is absolutely unpleasant from the first second and I only know that she was supposed to be "THE girl" reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis, whoever worked for that job made the movie look fun, quirky, romantic and quite nice. Whoever that person was, he should have been employed to rewrite this script. Halfway there, I did not care about any of the characters. Lisa, of Moore, is an aspiring actress who is cheerful and a bit intriguing (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous period work (which is supposed to be fun in the presentation) is on par with the rest of the script. Supposedly there is a romantic and happy comedy that ends with this turkey: given the material of the character with whom they had to work, I just can not imagine it. Save your money Warn your friends. DO NOT watch this movie.
