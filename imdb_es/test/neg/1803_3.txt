The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a film and as a representation of the classic story of Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between the book and the film, but that is expected in any transition from book to film. Kurtz dies in a different place; the manager does not accompany Marlow on his trip; Kurtz's lover spends much more time with him than in history. The real problem is the amount of footage that is included in the movie but has no basis in the real story. For some reason, the director finds the need to "spice up" some of the scenes, adding dramas or actions that rarely make sense and are always unimportant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are the "lover" of Kurtz that hits Marlow in the head and knocks him out. Nothing happens while he is unconscious and Marlow did not even provoke the attack. They spend a couple of hours and wake up: total loss of time. Kurtz has a pet monkey that, for some reason, kills on a whim. Also, when Marlow leaves the Kurtz station, he takes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained, without any real reason. Another flaw is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who describes himself as tall and inspiring: a man with a dominant presence. He practically whispers all his lines that, in the hands of a more capable actor, could have been very stimulating. I can not eliminate the image of John Malkovich playing a mentally disabled farmer in Of Mice and Men when I'm watching him playing the role of Kurtz. In general, I would rate the film in 3 out of 10 stars. It's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in the form of a movie, maybe to help you visualize the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I would never recommend it.
