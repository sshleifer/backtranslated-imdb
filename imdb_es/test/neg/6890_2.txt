Skeletons In The Closet takes the father-teen son genre to new low levels. This is a movie that is useless. The plot is presented in the first minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are a clich√© and, despite the twists of the plot that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything unfolds exactly as you think. In the middle of the movie, I could not stand the snail's rhythm anymore and I started to move quickly. The movie ended exactly as expected. Linda Hamilton is excellent as always and the other actors are above average, considering that there seems to be a total lack of direction. If you really think you need to see this extravagant vacuum cleaner, see how fast it moves.
