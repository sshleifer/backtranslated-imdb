I had seen it when I was a kid but, not being a big fan of Jerry Lewis, I had completely forgotten (not that it is memorable). The film revolves around the impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of each comic star!), In this case a German officer, and although it is not as bad as claimed by Leonard Maltin (giving him a rating of PUMP), it is not exactly the classic either of them - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if they are comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes before the appearance of the crazed general offer more happiness than forced humor at the expense of the Nazis! <br /> <br /> The movie was really Lewis's last breath during its heyday; in fact, this turned out to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (here it is painfully evident that his particular insanity would not be part of the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
