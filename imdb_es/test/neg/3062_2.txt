Wow, quite surprising that something so bad could be done. I give this movie a 2 because it is so bad that it has a certain type of "car accident". It's so bad, it's comical and it has some entertainment value. In addition, there is a bit of free nudity and that is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So, where do I start? The acting is more than horrible, it's like you're watching a high school play that's being filmed. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad for having been forced to do this movie and her performance reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just plain stupid. the cast of Dan Cortese as an FBI agent, the icing on the shit. His acting really made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Regarding the script and the direction C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should simply be removed and shot.
