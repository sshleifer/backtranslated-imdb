I should agree with the previous critic: this movie has an impressive animation, but has problems during the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The orifices of the plot are huge, the dialogue just explains the concepts of the plot ... The MAIN POINTS OF THE PLOT are not fully explained until the last five minutes of the film. The characters declare the obvious, while they do not explain the most confusing points of the film. There are characters that appear and have importance in the story that are never explained, most of them have names that are only mentioned * once *, and it is extremely confusing for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Don 'Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you're in this for a good laugh and how DUMB is.
