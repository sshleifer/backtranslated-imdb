The premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can, but the script and the directing effort are so bad that it's not surprising that this film has been buried, which is appropriate given the script. While watching this, I could not decide what was worse, the script or the direction. The actors are exaggerated, the artistic direction resembles a Disney movie, the music is devised and the feeling is so sweet that it gives spectators cavities. It is a bad attempt to imitate "Four weddings and a funeral". If one wants to see a comedy that is as flat as a pancake and the wrong direction that can turn a story into sweetness of the cavity, this is a good idea to watch.
