Ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian game. This is NOT the movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the vein of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things') This is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic movie of seductive lesbian vampires. This is NOT the movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking to lose an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is poorly written, misdirected, poorly scored, poorly filmed. He had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think you can really generate the same special effects in imovie lol. <br /> <br /> IT'S REALLY A BAD BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic beauties of the stars, however, they are more like porn. stars it was filmed as a soft-core pornography, however, you never get the injection of money and all the actors seem bored. the scenes of 'girl with girl', which sucks by the way, were so LAME that it's hardly worth mentioning them. Go see the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube because that's the only reason why you would want to see this movie and even there it's not worth it. Do not even pick it up, go see 'Cruel intentions 2' instead: the same movie without the bad special effects, the bad story, the bad writing, the bad dialogue and the bad acting. Actually I could go see him now just to purge my mind
