GOOD: tecnomusica that accompanies the game of the medieval sword. Also, the movie looks more elegant than most B-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> BAD: unintelligent argument, without acting and a totally incredible universe. I can usually see the potential of very bad movies; Hell, I love a good B movie like "Split Second" and the like. But this has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer ... Totally predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the terrible special effects, they are more like an old Playstation game than anything outside the myth! The use of a classic poem to sell this imbecile offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Just boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's much sexier!
