The fans of the horror comedy are going to like this one. Others may get angry quickly and turn it off. It is a kind of movie of friends, with excessive violence and gore, characters stereotyped deliberately and much madness. <br /> <br /> It seems like it was done with a budget of around $ 100, by a group of guys from the fraternity after a big beer keg party. There's a clue that he's a frustrated nerd, and his joking friend teasing him 30 times a second. There is a monster truck that chases them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Every time this thing and its driver appear with a twisted mask, it's a big scene. There is a mysterious girl who appears randomly in her backseat, and many giant types with monkeys hanging on red-necked rods. The nerd's friend never closes his yap, and puts them in one mess after another. Their discussions made me nervous, but other aspects of the film make up for it. <br /> <br /> The joking image of several films of "tormented psychopaths and trying to croak someone" are everywhere. Choose which one has the most riffs: Hills Have Eyes, Saw and Jeepers Creepers were some of the ones I recognized. <br /> <br /> It's a nice madness, if you're in the right frame of mind. Brewskies with their friends can make this more fun; It's a good bet that that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this together.
