Most films are bad with high production values, this is bad without high production values. What sets it apart from the great group of horrible movies. As bad as this movie was, I need to pay due respect to Kathryn Aselton, who, I think, if given the right script, will probably perform well. She plays Emily, Dohus' perennial girlfriend Josh, who often refers to her as "Friend" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, Emily is a semi-believable character. which means that Rhett will soon have to be added to the cast, to counter this almost credible character with a guy even more absurd than Josh. When we meet Rhett for the first time, we learn that he is "profound" because he is videotaping a lizard that is PROOF that he sees the world "in a unique way". Rhett then shows the tape to Emily and in one of the few incredible moments of Emily, she is impressed by this tape of an amateur lizard, WOW, I think that is how she responds once again without an irony of sarcasm, even slightly implied . <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, you are warned that the camera work will be horrible, we open ourselves with a shaky approach of Josh when he tries to conquer the spectators by acting GOOFY! Oh, how much concern, this main character is that GOOFY will act! LOL. This movie could almost be a case study about how bad movies can be (and, really, how bad bad movies can get on the festival circuit, I mean, compared to most of the shit on the circuit, this one movie probably looked pretty impressive). br /> <br /> I think SXSW gave this movie a small prize (oh south in the southwest, why do you encourage it, it's just cruel). But this is where I give a compliment to this movie, it's the best of the drunken movement. Keep in mind that all the other mumblecore movies are amazing and generally include grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting, but even so, it's good to be the best of something. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Baghead yet, but it seems that as maybe they have made some progress, the preview at least made it seem tolerable, while even the preview of the Puffy Chair could not hide the fact I was going to stink. I have left the subject here, anyway, it is very likely that Rhett is not represented by a professional actor, just as Josh is not a real actor, but the director (or brother of the director, there are some contradictory messages there). I think Rhett was a friend of someone and they said: Hey, why do not you play this guy named Rhett in the movie? The fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and the character probably means that the actor and the character are the same, unless I'm wrong. , which I am not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett were to shave the raccoon off his face, you would probably say he was attractive. Anyway, anyway, Rhett, Emily and Josh come together to bring the swollen chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen on the road, more bad acting, bad supporting actors, shit camera work, an attempt at importance. This film would not have been bad if it had not been so blatantly pursuing a deep personal importance. <br /> <br /> Everything is amateur, if you can watch this movie without paying it, as if it were on TV or to rent in the library, then consider looking at it, just to see if you like this super cheap filming style. I like what duplas do 'the whole concept of making a movie without anything, but I would like them to make a movie that someone would like to see.
