Crazy director ... Yes, you need to be crazy to make a movie nearby. Rob Lowe was bad in his character, Ice-t is always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. Crazy six is ​​an unknown film, with some well-known actors ... this is quite rare. A bad movie with some good actors in it. It seems that the bad movie influenced his performance ... He did it! Crazy ... I give it * and half out of *****
