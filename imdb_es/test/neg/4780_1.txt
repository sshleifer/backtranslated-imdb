The most frightening of the new horror film "The Ruins" by first-year director, Carter Smith, are the final credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he plunged his dollars into this cooler over the damned carnivorous underbrush that crawls toward its victims and devours them? Oscar-nominated guitarist Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan," which adapts his own successful novel, sticks firmly to the standard clichés and conventions of all the scores of frightening sagas where reckless youngsters do everything but signals that they ask the forces of evil to eat them. If the cretinous characters were not enough to deal with this nihilistic nonsense, we are invited to another film in which American tourists are in danger simply because they are American. Also, unlike the really good horror movies that explain why monsters need to feed, "The Ruins" does not provide any explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of their villainous vines. <br /> <br /> The configuration of "The Ruins" resembles the horror movie "Tourists" of 2006, in which the slippery South Americans caught American backpackers brainless and harvested them for their internal organs. In fact, the "tourists" generated some legitimate emotions and chills. "The Ruins" does not generate any emotions or chills. A malicious mastiff who suddenly wobbles in the camera to growl at our heroes is the closest thing to emotion. <br /> <br /> The rest of "The Ruins" borrows from another movie: "The Descent", an excellent 2006 cooler about a group of babies in a nightmarish experience when they get lost in a labyrinth of inhabited caves by albino mutants with blood thirst for murder. A couple of other movies that served intentionally or not, also come to mind. They are the simple classic of terror of 1968 "The Lost Continent" on the murderous vegetation that threatens the innocents in a sea of ​​abandoned boats and the cult class Roger Corman "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) on a florist of New York growing man-eating plant in his store .. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" takes place in picturesque and sunny Mexico in which four playful American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore from the movies " X-Men "), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of" The Covenant "), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of" Sleepers ") and Amy (Jena Malone of" Pride & Prejudice "), are finishing their spring break soaked in tequila. Stacy loses a precious slope in a motel pool, but Mathias (Joe Anderson, from "Copying Beethoven"), recovers and helps him, and the group embraces him as the best friend. These people live for the party and have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his misguided brother who has accompanied a beautiful archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that does not appear in any guide. He offers to take them with him and they accept. <br /> <br /> First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows where you're going, you should avoid it. Since they only have one day left and have not done anything adventurous, our two couples together with their Greek-speaking Spanish friend, Dimtri (the newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They take a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them to the next stage of their trip. A taxi driver looks at his map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to stay away, you stay away. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps you change your mind, takes them to their destination and then attacks them in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> As soon as our heroes find the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered in undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle from which the superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is enchanted and they kill Dimtri without hesitation when trying to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists rush to safety over the pyramid, while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Finally, the vines slide to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, "The Ruins" becomes "Bug", the recent and ridiculous schizoid film by Ashley Judd about insects that get under the skin. In a short time, our heroes are dividing each other in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. A particularly dreadful scene shows the Americans jumping the legs of the German man to save his life. In comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition seem tame. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" is classified as a mess of another vine with nothing to redeem it.
