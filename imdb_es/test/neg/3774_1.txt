I attended a screening of this movie. Travolta came to do a question and answer session after the movie ended. It was a small screening room in Tribeca. Out of courtesy to him, I did not give up what I wanted to do. This is making movies at its worst. To begin the script was badly written. The writer writes with one voice. The dialogue was forced and clich√©. The way in which this writer / director got Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment to back her up is the only brilliant thing he achieved in this fiasco. <br /> <br /> In fact, I recommend this movie to all aspiring screenwriters. , directors and filmmakers. Because when you are told that you are wasting time, it will be impossible for you to achieve your goals. Hey ... just look at this shit and say to yourself ... if you can make this possible. <br /> <br /> PS- Travolta did a great question and answer session, although ... he was calm, he spoke. Free and was a nice guy to the land. The director / writer stayed on the sidelines. When John tried to involve her in the conversation, he stayed behind like a piece of wood and never joined her. I looked at it and I thought ... how could this person successfully "launch" the agents, studio executives, the best talent? ... when he can not open his mouth in a projection of his own movie. The conclusion of some of us that we attended was that she must have strong family connections in the business. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, you must follow it with the Guy Ritchie zero star masterpiece "Swept Away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst acting of wife Madonna. She is so bad and she looks so bad in this movie that I think this was her way of coming back to her for all the abuse that he takes away from her at home.
