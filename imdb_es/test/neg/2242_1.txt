This movie does not deserve a top-down review, it just made me decide that I will not go to see the next Tarantino movie. And I used to love Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> It is not artistic, it is not entertaining, it is not witty, it is not fun, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this movie had been Tarantinos first, it would also have been the last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino must control himself, otherwise, his next film will be 3 hours without meaning, boring and carefree. dialogue. It seems that he has fallen in love with their dialogue, and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> After finishing your popcorn, there is no reason to sit in a theater.
