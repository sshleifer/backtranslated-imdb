He had the misfortune to see this while traveling by coach across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I have ever encountered. It deserves to be the worst number of all times ;-) No acting, no argument, very little talking. A lot of ape-like grunts, however, in this desperately unlikely movie. An involuntary self-satire, or you'll laugh or cry.
