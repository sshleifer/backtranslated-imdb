Being a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a 3 pack of cr @ ppy horror at Best Buy today. The set was cheap and included a terrible movie called "The Dark" that I really remember seeing in the theater. <br /> <br /> The remaining 2 were just as bad. "The creatures of the abyss" are probably the worst in the group. Since they were all bad, that does not say much. But his stupidity, his bad performance, his terrible effects and his delayed history actually made it very fun to watch. I was rolling on the floor with each new development of the plot. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the lost crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong! It was great!!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG!! I almost lost it !!! Between that and the "monstrous camera", I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I enjoyed it, but to be fair, I had to give the movie to 1. It was horrible ... But if the trash is your bag, at least rent this one ... (YES, the NAL word game was intentional)
