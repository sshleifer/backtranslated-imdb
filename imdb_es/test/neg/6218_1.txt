Having avoided watching the movie at the cinema, but when I bought the DVD for my wife for Christmas, I had to see it. I did not expect much, which usually means that I get more than I expected. But 'Mamma Mia' - absolute, absolute cr **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have old records. But this movie is just terrible. The stage show seems a bit musical, but these races along with the songs followed hastily, without characterization, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are shot with only half of the bodies. Always on screen , the northern European dance choir appears on a small Greek island at will, while the set and configuration of the numbers would have dishonored Cliff Richard's musicals in the 1960s. Even make your usual assault effective in an exaggerated musical! Her great piece, 'The Winner Takes It All', is Meryl at the Met! Note to the director: it should have been filmed in silence with the camera gradually showing the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Part of the singing is horrible karaoke at amateur night. The camera can not stop moving like bad MTV. One can never calm down and simply enjoy the music, the enthusiasm and the characters. But what is even worse is how this failed piece of excre **** has become the highest-grossing movie in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot. Blair, Campbell and New Labor have really reduced the UK to zombies, critical faculties for someone?
