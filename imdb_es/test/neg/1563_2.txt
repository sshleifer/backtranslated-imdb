By a strange coincidence, I began to see this movement right after Brice de Nice and the good thing was that there were not many films that could be worse than Brice de Nice, so I was hoping for something better that would make me forget this horrible failure. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, OSS-117 left me disappointed again. I do not know, maybe it's just a problem with the translations, but since "Diner de Cons" I have not seen ANY French comedy that I call really good. Even when I look at the reviews in IMDb, only people from France are giving the high marks of OSS-117 ... <br /> <br /> For me, this movie did not really work: in some places it's as fun as it is real Bond movies, in other jokes, were a bit too predictable or too cheesy.
