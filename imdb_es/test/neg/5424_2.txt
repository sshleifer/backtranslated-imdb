There really is not much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically they are some episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. However, it is extremely outdated. The treatment of Winky with Vena is a good example of this. It must be remembered that it was designed to be shown to children in the 1950s. In this sense, it succeeds. If you like science fiction for children of the 1950s, go ahead and take a look. You'll see John Banner in a pre-sgt. The role of Schultz. He does a good job on it. In general, I would give it a 6 out of 10. It's not great, but it's not bad.
