This is a perfect example of the horror shit of the 90s. Nothing is scary here and the movie has almost no blood. Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct, like in a television movie. This is not a completely bad image. I can say for sure that I found it quite pleasant. However, the lack of originality hurts a lot "Voodoo". All in all, if you are part of the general audience and pseudo horror movies like "Scream" are your favorites, then I love "Voodoo", but if you want something very scary, avoid this movie.
