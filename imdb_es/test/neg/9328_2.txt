Well, after watching "Beginning", I thought why the hell they burned the Schraders version and they made that poor thing. But now, after seeing "Dominion" I deeply understand this decision. Even they did not get much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good times, but a really boring story and some of the big holes in the plot are killing this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the history of the exorcist has a lot and in a prequel about this, you can build on a lot and give references that the public wants to see. But there is very little of that in the movie. The effects are really bad, not even TV standard.
