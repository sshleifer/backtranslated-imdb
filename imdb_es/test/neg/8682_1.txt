<br /> <br /> Very boring and laborious adaptation of the funny satire of Amis. The hero is represented not as a nice loser but as a simple offensive cretin. Most of the rest are pure caricatures with only Helen McCrory that offers real quality and provides some of the wit of the novel. The period is encamped as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror and rock and roll comics. A real failure even by the standards of bad television in the United Kingdom. <br /> <br />
