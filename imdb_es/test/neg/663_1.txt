I got stuck in the traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (in a military base) to see Superman Returns, arrived 15 minutes late and the only other movie that was presented was "See No Evil", there was no poster. ready for that, and only a brief description of the movie on the calendar ... but my girlfriend and I decided to watch it ... As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE, I knew it was going to be horrible. The few people in the theater laughed most of the time, and it was the first movie I honestly considered leaving, and I've seen "The Ringer" ... well, I would have gotten out of that. but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was stupid.
