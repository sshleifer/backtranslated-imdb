In my opinion, the end is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea that someone suddenly realized that he was the son of God and the second coming was something intelligent. People began to believe him, and his friends became the new disciples. People went crazy, demons possessed people, all kinds of fun. Of course, then everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to assume the impossible task of reviewing a large number of writings to find the "third testament" in five days, but in the end it became this ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I will not spoil it, but I will say that it comes off as if it had been written by a teenager with very limited knowledge of theology. I heard they are doing an American version of this story, I just hope they change the ending.
