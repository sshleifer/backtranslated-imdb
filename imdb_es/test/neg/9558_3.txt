My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol, this is the case a lot) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. COOL! This should be a good drama. This movie had great potential ... the direction and the way everything was going in rhythm was very good. But once the movie was over, I could not help but wonder if it really was worth making a movie for this story. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY upset, she just could not tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in the film in terms of acting, but again it was difficult for me to feel sympathy for his character ... he just came out as an idiot, an exalted loser of a gangster ... in which he had no place. Life 'in the first place. How could he enter with people like Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano? This movie left me with an insipid but uncomfortable feeling ... what was the problem with this movie? I just did not feel complete with Bugsy. Beatty's antics, while acting pretty well, seemed too random and illogical. I guess that was really Siegel's way ... but it was too much of that. There just did not seem to be much real history here. My basic evaluation would be <br /> <br /> "a sloppy, playboy, low-performance gangster, falls in love with a woman loser, comes up with the idea of ​​'Las Vegas' ... but his failed attempt at the The casino he builds, besides not taking into account the money of his mafia bosses, kills him. " <br /> <br /> What else is there besides that? I just did not see the big problem with this, and it was a big disappointment. There should not have been many films to go out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 Oscars surpasses me (although the two that won are justifiable). 1.5 / 4 stars.
