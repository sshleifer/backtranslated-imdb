With a humor that would attract a small and exclusive audience, the average viewer will consider it useless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network announced this show, it was made to look like it was a big drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the Sheep. <br /> <br /> When it came to light In the air, I was disappointed that all the characters were so one-dimensional and a completely bland animation. The only thing that put him in touch with humor were the names of characters such as "Private Public" and "General Specific," some vague references to cultural aspects and how Lady Richington hit Sheep with her steel wig. <Br /> <br /> A little off topic, but I do not see why the Sheep would fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky". It was horrible!
