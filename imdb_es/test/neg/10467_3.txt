Now, before I tell you the synopsis, this is a revision without a spoiler. Bone Eater reaches its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I do not know how these movies even get to DVD. If I saw it in theaters it would bother me a lot. Bone Eater is about these people who dig an old cemetery and find some bones. He is the "bone-eater" and the more bones he eats, the more powerful he becomes. <br /> <br /> First of all I thought well, well, the DVD illustration looks creepy and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it scared me. But then, when I played it, I could agree on one thing: the title 'Bone Eater' is better than the movie itself. Tell me what's stupider? A bone-eater who only attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear? Do not worry, it's not a spoiler that sees what happens in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid than 'Bone Eater' to have a horse? Do you know what I think is the stupidest? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is horrible. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone eater' was creepy, but once you see what you really think is a kind of action movie or just a cruel joke. The movie felt longer than Titanic and this was half an hour. Once the movie really has its moments of suspense, it simply stops. I admit that the performance was not the best, but in reality it was decent and that the violence was not exaggerated, but everything else is a stench. <br /> <br /> In general, the bone consumer is a movie that you can skip. If you like interesting movies with great creatures, great CGI and suspense, 'Bone Eater' is a movie to jump. If you like bad movies, no matter how corny they are, then "Bone Eater" will satisfy you.
