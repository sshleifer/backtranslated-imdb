After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget films "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "Coming from outer space ... and those things" were involved in the creation of this film, I decided to buy it without being view. DVD. I wish I had not done it. The other films were funny, ironic and a little stupid. While Kraftverk 3714 lacks humor at all. And it's so scary that I'm getting angry just thinking about it. The worst possible actors, the worst possible script, the worst special effects available. And the most unsexy sex scene ever. Uhhh And everything continues for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please, never make another movie.
