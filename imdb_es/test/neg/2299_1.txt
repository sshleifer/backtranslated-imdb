When my mom came down to the video store to rent a movie at night, my sister and I learned a lesson, to accompany my mom to the video store! In fact, the only reason she chose him was because Colin Firth was in it and she * cough * thinks he is a good actor. <br /> <br /> Start with some beautiful views of Africa and then it goes down and down. AND DOWN, AND DOWN. After this movie, I was very surprised that Colin Firth went as far as he did, because this pointless movie could destroy any actor's career. <br /> <br /> The story is about a divorced woman whose son is trying to make her match her. the man named Matthew Fields, whom he met while impressing his friends because of his big house. <br /> <br /> Nimi does not like Matthew at all and is dating the local vicar that his son John does not like. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you do not agree with me and I hope I have not offended you but all the people who have not seen this movie, I leave you with a word of warning, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ With a word of warning, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!!
