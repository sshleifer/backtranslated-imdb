On the pure theatrical side, Last Stand was great, since the recreations and the soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better stories of this battle found in other places that, although not so long or striking, are much more complete historically. <br /> <br /> Certain small details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and the mispronunciation of various names and words, really affected me. <br /> <br /> My guess would be, that because "Last Stand of the 300" aired on the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the History Channel was just trying to take advantage of the whims of the movie's hype. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a description that is historically accurate in all possible aspects, you would have better luck elsewhere.
