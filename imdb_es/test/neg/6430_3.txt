In the first place, this film is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since I did not understand this horrible story myself. In addition, the unknown cast, led by an actress named Laura Mennell, is simply horrible. The expressions and shouts of the character of Sara Tobias are ridiculous and ridiculous, making faces with the performance. Last, but not least, there are many favorable reviews about this film in IMDb like the following: <br /> <br /> - Top Notch: Can not I wait to see more directors work? the author has only one revision in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br />: Incredibly shot, incredibly intense? the author has only one review in IMDb on August 12, 2004; <br /> <br /> - It's not your typical blood and blood, in fact better. 7/10 ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on February 13, 2005; <br /> <br /> - As intense as Asian horror! - the author only has a review in IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are the parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this garbage? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 ??? A Nova Prophecia" ("11.11 ??? The New Prophecy")
