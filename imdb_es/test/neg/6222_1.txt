I do not know where most of you were, but where I saw the movie we did not have people singing as some have said they experienced, we had people laughing, mainly in Campy's plot, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of Brosnan's tastes. The only people in the audience who seemed to be captivated by the movie were the people of the seventies generation who were somehow reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and I even went to the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September of '79, so I appreciated them and I still do now. But this movie should have gone in the same way as their marriages and end in divorce. The sequences were so poorly organized, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible, and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I can not believe that a winner of an academy prize would duck so much as to make this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
