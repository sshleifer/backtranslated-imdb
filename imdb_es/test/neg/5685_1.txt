I have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action, and what about the third person's comment throughout the movie? Instead of running around the planet to shoot in all these places, they should have spent some money on scripts and actors. What acted there was terrible. This was 90 minutes of my life, I can never go back. I should bill the director for the cost of renting this movie. To the director and writers of this film ... resign now. This movie should have a label on the front that says: Beware of boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the generation of computers. It is fine as is the generation. This movie should never have a sequel ... ever.
