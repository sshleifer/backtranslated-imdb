Sometimes, changes in novels when they become movies are not only necessary, but a good thing. However, in the case of the Northanger Abbey, it is very, very bad. Not only is the story itself shattered, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and its mix of romance and intrigue does not even touch the scathing comment that Austen put on her work. It is not at all funny or satirical, and instead turns the character's fascination for his fantasy world into a drama. <br /> <br /> This also affects romance. It is meandering and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, which makes the audience wonder what he sees in her. <br /> <br /> Hopefully one day soon, we will get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.
