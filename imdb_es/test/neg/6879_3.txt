I see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies. Because it does not really contain a candle for the horror era of the 70s and 80s of gold, this is, of course, where personal taste comes in. <br /> <br /> This movie simply falls into the category of "New generation of Slashers" in my book, the cast is typical of 18-24 year olds and potential models. Personally, I'm pretty tired of that image in horror movies, old movies at least had some variation in people. One or more fat people, and dorks in general. Only people of simple aspect, of course, having a couple of good spectators is fine, they have always been there. But when the whole cast is just a bunch of nice shelves and butts, it's getting stupid. I mean, yes, I do like to see hot girls. But not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some common people who are persecuted, for example, by a maniac with a knife ... You expect people who are hunted to look like any random person you see on the street. I think. Of course, there are some movies with good viewers that are perfectly fine, but not many. "Wrong turn" is an example of the best. <br /> <br /> The next point is the killing scenes that the slashers should talk about. In this bad movie, all you can see is 2-3 frames of sound / sudden scream and music in crescendo. And that is. The little you can see is not graphic at all, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. The slashers of the old school compared to this had much more and better death, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers in those movies, who outdid the one you'll see here. <br /> <br /> As for true horror fans, it's more fun and exciting to see the horrors with new approaches because of the originalities. that appears, the murderer in this does not add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone said before, the CGI is something I hate to see. Personally I prefer makeups in that sense, I'm conservative (unless the CGI is really well done). But the most important thing is to establish a good mood that allows you to "get into the movie", a good background story is a very good thing. Also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers eliminates all the sense of mysticism that adds a lot of humor, and does not give you much to think about. Just as an example: keeping the murderers in the background in complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean that if everything related to history or people should be explained or shown in detail, then there is not much content left for the viewer to reflect on ... It's like watching a porn movie and expecting a big one in the meantime, a story. <br /> <br /> Why the old-school killings still work, at least for some people. It's because they are established cult films of the time when they were something new, so making new ones of that kind today is really difficult. The exception could be, of course, for people who are new to those kinds of horrors. I have noticed that many people like this kind of horror movies, so of course, there is no "Right taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for the people who could share my opinion; Here you have a frame of reference on what to expect from this movie.
