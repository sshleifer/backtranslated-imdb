It's weird, this movie; It gives you the impression that the creators of this snooze-fest spent more time in local bars than on the set. In fact, it's a surprise not to see the name of Harry Alan Towers in the credits; It certainly has the flavor of one of its productions of tax shelter, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be that everyone involved enjoys a prolonged stay in Provence. Although the film is supposed to take place throughout the region, Les Baux and the surrounding area represent almost everything. <br /> <br /> David Birney becomes a spectacularly colorless hero, as Michael Lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking clich√©". What Lonsdale is doing in this is an assumption of either. For some reason, the most interesting character, played by Rampling, remains on the sidelines, while, independently of the book, he should have been the central figure because he clearly has the ability to take the film (which would have been boring anyway, but at least at least, we would have more of something nice to see). <br /> <br /> In general, it is a pointless matter that is only worth looking at to see how an action movie can be without action.
