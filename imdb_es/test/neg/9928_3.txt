... that you easily detect the biggest flaw in the movie. What was the reason? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but definitely missing the story. There is no thread to follow. I suppose if it was done correctly, the movie would have lasted a little longer, but it would be worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The casting is very good, I loved Wilson as Vicky vulnerable. <br /> <br /> There really is not much more to say. But I really wish they had concentrated a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
