Although it comes after three Star Wars, Krull and many others, this movie will be outdated in the 1950s ... 1 SFX mainly consists of video game effects from the 1970s like bolts, etc .; Annoyed after a while. You also get an SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of some level IV Harryhausen monster. <br /> <br /> 2 games are mainly ruins in the countryside, with papier-mâché temples and miniature cities or purple ones that make The Japanese monster movies of the 1950s look like impeccable perfection. <br /> <br /> 3 The plot is an extra fine paper ... Hercules must find the seven golden rays of Zeus stolen by conspiratorial gods and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 action consists mainly of muscular Hercules (check the variety of facial expressions) fighting for the effects of video games of the 70s. <br /> <br /> The prize of 5 performances is awarded to Milly Carlucci (third sister of Carlucci's show with Anna) & Gabriella), who says it all. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other Italian level II salad movies like L'UMANOIDE and STAR CRASH look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Well, considering that Ferrigno's main performance feat consisted of posing as a retarded green monster, wearing a whig and green sparrows, we should be lenient. <br /> <br /> Watch it and forget it.
