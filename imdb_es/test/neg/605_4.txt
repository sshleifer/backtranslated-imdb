"When a Killer Calls" is an unusually nasty slasher movie, with some very unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision was clearly taken to try to take advantage of the new version of "When a Stranger Calls", almost introducing, almost word for word, the sequences of telephone calls of that film. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but very common) sin that the heroine's friends are repulsive imbeciles. So for the beginning of the movie, we like it a lot and we are supporting the nanny (a good credible job of Rebecca Kochan), but then she joins the standard teenage friends of the film and the environment is ruined. <br /> <br /> The type of movie works, but it's probably much more unpleasant than expected, so be careful.
