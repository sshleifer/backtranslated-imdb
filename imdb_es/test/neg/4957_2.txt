Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with some serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster, and now he eliminates his anger for everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> Then, when his teacher (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of a monster, he learns that he has to control his anger and use it for good instead of evil, and fight against the creatures that have been tormenting his nightmares from that fateful night. <br /> <br /> You really get your B rating, but what? It was great because it did not focus on the CGI graphics with B-rated shit. In fact, 0% of the movie was CGI. The monsters actually came together decently, and although the plot was missing, it was something visible ... even if it was only once.
