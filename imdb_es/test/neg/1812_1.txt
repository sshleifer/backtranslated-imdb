The movie Heart of Darkness is an insult to Joseph Conrad's book. To be honest, the movie made me want to sleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. I feel that the film omitted several key elements and omitted some of the main points of the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, while not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meanings and interesting twists in the plot. The book, although very confusing and complex, is amazing. When you finally understand it, you feel that you have really learned something. The novel, or short story, had several key ideas such as uselessness and madness, which the film put aside. In addition, several key scenes were changed, which in turn affected the whole plot. Many of the scenes seemed to be very "choppy", in the sense that they did not fit. In short, the movie seemed to be a misinterpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend watching this movie if you can not see or understand the book, but otherwise, I would skip this one. It was terrible, and in complete disarray. If you have never read the book, then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information of the book to understand it. The film was a horrible consequence of a prominent and detailed book.
