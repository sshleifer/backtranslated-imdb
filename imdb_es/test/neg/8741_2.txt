I started watching this movie on television. A few weeks ago, but he gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. At the beginning, the person in the witness protection scheme located on an isolated farm gets nervous about his guards placed outside, and then asks the guard inside the house if he can make a phone call, only to find out that cut the line. Soon after, Roy Scheider, as one of the witness's assassins, duly appears and executes the witness and his wife, in which the character of Roy Scheider takes the phone from the kitchen wall, marks a number and then speak: it is done !!!! That was all for me!
