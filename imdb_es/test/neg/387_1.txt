This is possibly the worst movie ever made, which was really taken seriously. And not as a result of the performance, because as an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, only to escape the need for electroconvulsive therapy after the main picture was over. Being one of the 57 people who really saw this movie in a theatrical premiere, I must say that never before or since I have experienced a movie in which the movie ended, the credits rolled, the house lights went on and nobody moved from your seats. Approximately five minutes after the lights of the house were turned on, people started coming out of their commas to look around, and I think most of us thought, well, we understood, that was a joke, right? they are going to show the real movie. Finally, after the ushers delivered disguises, and we swore to keep the secret of not admitting that we were there, we felt it was safe to leave, praying that they would not see us leave the auditorium. I've seen some pretty bad movies in my day (I have Cinemax for God's sake), but I'm still bitter because I can never get back those two or more hours of my life that I lost when I saw Closet Land.
