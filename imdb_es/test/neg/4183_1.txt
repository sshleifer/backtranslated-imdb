This thing. oh god this thing I can not even call it a movie. A movie is something that does something. goes somewhere Has a certain appearance of a plot or SOMETHING. I do not know how I'm doing it. I really do not do it. First I say that the dark fields is the worst movie in history. And I thought it was. Then the pirates of the ghost island showed me that I was wrong. and now, for the third consecutive time, another movie goes beyond the duty to prove that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: Corn. Sir, this is horrible. Let me break it down for you. The man feels that the daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers that he got from his Act II popcorn apparently and runs to find them in a cornfield. Of course, this is the largest corn field in existence, since it is the size of the cornfields of Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn and Signs combined. the main character, whose name is Shy (amazing name by the way) then runs through a field of corn ... find some ghost girls, talk to them and ... run through a field of corn. dig a while ... and run through a field of corn. And how incredibly sad? I'm not really leaving anything out. That's almost the whole movie. The only thing I can ignore is how two policemen who want to arrest him chase him for ... I do not know. pretending to be an actor. I did not care at this point. He escapes and the police is - something - for the killer off the screen. Holy shit is there a killer? apparently yes, there is as almost 4/5 has been introduced in the film. but wait! then he escapes for a while and there, you guessed it, more running through the corn field and digging. Then there is the ending where he saves his daughters. Huzzah <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it's boring. It is INCREDIBLY INHUMAN, TREMENDELY boring. I can not explain how atrocious this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as a root canal, and it's only an hour and a half of NOTHING. The ONLY thing that came out of this movie was that my friend and I could have found enlightenment due to the near nirvana state that this film put on us after the effects of drugs in our brain had to be activated to keep us alive. During the insane madness, I found hugging a much nicer wall and my friend found a new passion to laugh hysterically as he threw himself across the floor as if he had an attack. This is the kind of madness that this movie brings. It's not just bad, it's bad for your health. The cover looks amazing with the image of an AWESOME scarecrow killer who would consider dressing like a scam of terror, but this was the most deceitful box in history. DO NOT LET IT DEMAND YOURSELF! DO NOT watch this movie. Watch a better corn movie. ANY movie about corn is better. just do not let it catch you do not do it 0 out of 10
