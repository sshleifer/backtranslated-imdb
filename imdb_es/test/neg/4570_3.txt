"Tricks" by Andrew Gurland is his fictitious "real story" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on exams. The quartet is: supercilious hate to the school Trevor Fehrman (as Handsome Davis), his friendly friend Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), his chubby companion who hates the school Elden Henson (as Sammy) and the clumsy geekster Martin Starr) . The adults include Mary Tyler Moore, the North Point director and the father of pornography, Griffin Dunne (as Mr. Davis). Crazy people start with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence supposedly peeing in a teacher's grade book. Put this at the bottom of the stack; and he is grateful that it is not included in anyone's permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheaters (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
