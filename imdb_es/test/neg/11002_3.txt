The Fanglys is located in a small Texas town called Layton on the eve of Halloween, while the townspeople treat it as the second coming of Christ or something. I mean, Halloween is not that important, right? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called to another murder, since the local boy Ned (associate co-author John William Galt) discovered a body in the local forest. Could it be Lady Fang (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch that kills teenagers, who knows? Being the kind of funny person Mark is (the director and assistant producer, Harvey) convinces his wife, Kelly (Laurie Reeves), to go to a cemetery where his partner Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a party of Halloween. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to Kelly and she agrees, along with Steven and a girl he called Camille (Natalie Woods) and his nerdy friend Jerry (Tim Boswell), all decided Enjoy a night of fun, and the fun you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. However, they soon discover that the legend of Lady Fang is far from the sleeping story that many do ... <br /> <br /> Edited, produced by the executive, written and directed by Christopher Abram The Fanglys is an attempt Pretty silly of a horror movie. The script is very predictable, boring and does not offer any kind of entertainment value, in the right hands and with a decent budget. The Fangly could have been an effective horror film, but as it is, it is not. It moves at a good pace, but the "action" on the screen is so poor that it does not matter, I do not know what else to say that The Fanglys is a really bad movie and I can not see. Anyone who gets some kind of enjoyment of it. The dialogue is basic, the characters are cliché and lifeless, while in general the film seems much longer than the 90 minutes long. There are some unconvincing attempts at humor that do not sit so well together with the elements of horror and what was the delay in that cage? I imagine that the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry in the end, then you'll have to keep looking beyond the final credits as the shameful truth is revealed, assuming you can really get that far (believe me it's necessary to do it). ). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does not do anything special. Abram believes that the neon light bathroom scenes are elegant, I can tell you that it is not when your movie is supposed to be set in the woods. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, emotion or any of the elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget the decent blood, there is a bit when someone removes the skin from the arm and a hairpin gets stuck in someone's throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently The Fanglys had a shooting budget of $ 2,837, which makes it one of the movies with the lowest budget. always to have a commercial release, and to be brutally honest, it shows. What about the retarded boy and his false joke teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the cinematography of the camcorder and the terrible performance of everyone involved make it even more uncomfortable to sit down. <br /> <br /> The Fanglys is a direct crap to video, has no redemption features. Whatever it is and it is low The score of the users of IMDb is totally justified, it is one of those movies that, in half an hour, was looking at the clock and wishing that the thing had just finished.
