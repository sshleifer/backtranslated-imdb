When this program is broadcast for the first time, I must admit that I am intrigued by the premise and the scenario. With an open mind, I saw the first two episodes and, of course, I discarded it because I was destined to run for half the season at the most. I ran into A / E recently and witnessed an advertisement for this crap and I could barely contain my surprise. I really hope that people are looking at this to laugh and not take it seriously. The characters are really some of the most ridiculous and cheeky of television, scripted or otherwise. Obviously, it is generating ratings, so I must give credit to the creators for establishing and maintaining a fan base, but seriously I hope no one is seeing this under any pretense of seriousness.
