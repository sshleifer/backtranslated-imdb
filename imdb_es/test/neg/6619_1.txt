I really did not get this movie because I'm not a pervert like you, who likes lesbians. <br /> <br /> The girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are SO silicone)!), but she is really lame and insecure. She tries to go out as a surfer (better than dressing up as a horny but still strange and definitely not in fashion); The movie does not explain why he is trying to pass himself off as a man. Oh, right, to "catch" the poor, silly girl. Forgot. She makes all these stupid inventions that are not funny, and she's a very bad actress. Also, that appearance is so OUT! <br /> <br /> This silly blond girl from Melrose Place plays (surprise) a silly blonde. <br /> <br /> She believes that the girl in the wig is a boy! They even kiss! Ewww! I guess that part was kind of funny.
