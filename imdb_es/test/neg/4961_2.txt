With my two stars, I probably reached the head of IMDb, "I hated it", ready for this apparently tremendously popular television series. <br /> <br /> Not only because of the enthusiastic comments on this website, I decided to buy a DVD edition of the series. Because I usually find that British humor suits me, I gave up in the middle of the second installment and, according to other comments, the "funniest bits" were already available. <br /> <br /> So now I know, according to another comment, that I definitely lack a sense of humor. But then I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and looking back) Fawlty Towers, what black books are there? although weakly? Thematically related. Why the different reactions? It can be a mere Generation, and yet the differences can be pointed out. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are established in businesses designed to financially support their owners. Both companies are not successful but they seem ?? by a miracle ?? to survive. Fawlty Towers is fun because the protagonists have to deal with situations that they can not face. The fun lies in the fact that they make a great effort to succeed and, while laughing, one also feels sorry for them. Black Books has no situations, it is just there and the owner spends his time feeling sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to arise, it is quickly rejected. It is remarkable how quickly and frequently a theme is released and the protagonists resort to something completely different to produce an additional joke. Telling jokes? and not very good - it seems to be from Black Book. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would have done the job just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore because, under the guise of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance, the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and CULTURED. There are some low level gorillas, but clumsy semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they're like you and me. The way the series makes that statement is the only way I can explain its success. There is nothing remarkable in the actions of the protagonist, the special thing about them are their economically unrealistic living conditions that many viewers may envy them. The fact that the First World is currently living. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Tittybangbang, also a fairly new British comedy show on British television. . I found it strangely funny. Is it often quite insipid or xenophobic? But always with a purpose and hitting the target in his social criticism. Humor is created mainly by situations or by characters with a purpose. The low ratings on IMDb could indicate that this brand of humor is not in line with the times, but I am glad that he is still alive and kicking and I hope he will continue to do so.
