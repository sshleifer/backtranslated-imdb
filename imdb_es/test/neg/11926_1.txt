Just up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The premise sounded great, some of the commercials seemed semi promising, but, unfortunately, the whole movie lasted about 30 seconds. sharpness, and that showed in the 30-second slot of the small screen. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second-class effects, ridiculous costumes and a complete snoozefest by all means. that. The plot is recycled science fiction fodder. Pity too, because when I entered I thought it would be bad but I kept hope. It may be the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen many. <br /> <br /> In a few words: do not see it. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you liked one of the 3 previous films.
