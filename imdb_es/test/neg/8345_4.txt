The volcano is located in Los Angeles, where a small earthquake has just happened, the chief of holidays of the O.E.M. (Emergency Management Officer) Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to shorten his vacation and enter, once he sees that all is well, but then goes to the epicenter of the earthquake where seven underground workers were killed by a fire or heat intense of some kind. Mike is not sure what to think, so he takes geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) to try and explain things. Unfortunately, a huge underground river of molten lava was released after the earthquake and exploded in the Al Brea Tar Pits shipment. the lava that is poured into the streets of the city envelops everything and everything that burns. Mike, his men and the emergency services have a great effort trying to stop the lava river and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Mick Jackson, this was the second great movie budget for disasters revolving around the idea of ​​an erupting volcano during 1997 with Dante's Peak (1997) being released just two months before the Volcano did, and while Dante's peak is not any kind of Masterpiece, at least it is a little better and more plausible than the Volcano. The script here is total nonsense and is not based on reality at all, the underground lava flows that seem to appear and then disappear just as quickly, the inches of several characters in a lava river are still unaffected by the heat (when that guy on the train, the metallic seats around him start to melt, but he's still perfectly fine.) As far as I know, human skin is not as heat-resistant as metal, right?) and it happens constantly, flying helicopters are clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), a simple block at the end of a street will stop the lava flowing (what happens through the other streets and other directions?), being able to fly a perfect trench in a street and then blow a huge building to make a massive dam and when Kelly sees that the lava goes to his car, she goes out as everyone would, but for some reason she just stays there and watches two firefighters burn and is But her father has saved her, although for this stage her leg has burned down, even though all the concrete blocks were put together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes, the guy does a great job, not a little of molten lava manages to filter and much more, like that massive building that falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter. then both are well after. The characters are also horrible, although they were not as cliché as usual, without a flourishing romance between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and the city officials who try to silence Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event and described them as terrorists. There are some moral moments that are badly written and sometimes embarrassing when the Angels come together, the black man and the semi-racist policeman who warm up to each other and at the end they are wishing each other and that little boy at the end when he says "everything The world looks the same, it is worth it and it is without a doubt an inflexible attempt and try to say what color we are, we are still human beings and we can get along well in times of crisis, since it unites people. Volcano is one of those bad movies that good, that entertains and progresses at a decent pace, but do not expect anything based on reality or any human drama. <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like Volcano could be seen as an update of a 70's disaster movie like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974) but with a big budget with modern effects, speaking of the effects, they are fine, but none stands out very much and the pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, surely there are some impressive explosions and a few lava flows that flow through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. In general, Volcano is simply not very exciting and, although occasionally fun and completely ridiculous, it does not work the way manufacturers intended. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 90,000,000, it opened a little under $ 15,000,000 at the box office, it looks good and there's a lot of fire but nothing stands out and Volcano is a pretty forgettable movie in general. Filmed in Los Angeles, I think that most of the places presented here were filmed in real life. The cast follows the moves with a terrible dialogue and ridiculous arrangements to deal with, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this. <br /> <br /> The volcano is a disaster in both directions, it is a disaster. Thematic film that ended up being a bit of a disaster. It's worth it for a few involuntary laughs and the ridiculousness of all this, but it's nothing special and I doubt that I'll ever want to see it again.
