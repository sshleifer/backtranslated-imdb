I've seen some rubbish based on the Bible. This one overcomes everything. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to compare the biblical knowledge of your child with the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor, take a walk in the Sahara. Since I am obliged to give you a ten-line statement of why you do not watch this movie, let me say that there is absolutely no exchangeable quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. Everything has a stench of "let's make the biblical account be delayed." The basic logic is that, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why are they not worth it? Since the basic logic is not met, something is wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer about poetic licenses taken ... which is the underestimation of the century. Poetic rape. But then, poetics would be an undeserved favor.
