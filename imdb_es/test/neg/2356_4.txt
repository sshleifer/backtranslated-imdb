Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks he had yet to discover and was less than half overwhelmed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (that is, La Quinta Columna, a very evocative phrase for clandestine espionage and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high, as did the images of the end at the top of the Statue of Liberty. Freedom. <br /> Basically, Saboteur is as cheerful as it was The 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title) but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are pretty sensible) and it is definitely not so fast. Like a persecution movie across the US UU From Los Angeles to New York, Saboteur crawls from sequence to sequence. The sequence in the villain's lovely ranch? Charming ranch, charming villain but quite tame in general, really does not add anything. The encounter with the blind, the mix with the people of the circus, the sequence of Soda City, the sequence of balls of NY? They fall flat, bringing more characters with very little added value of suspense. <br /> <br /> A big problem that I can point out is the relationship between the protagonists Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, which is not forming as with Robert Donat. and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 Steps. Therefore, the entire narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is not clear if the hook is the escape of the hero of the police, the villains or their action to stop the sabotages hatched. In The 39 Steps, he was clearly programmed as 1 / escaping from the police (so he knows the hero can not go to the police), then 2 / running for his life and after the villains prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock from the wartime propaganda of the 1940s, I would advise you to choose a foreign Correspondent instead of Saboteur. Both are persecution movies with a catchy ending, well, really exciting and not only tourism in foreign Correspondent, as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills ...).
