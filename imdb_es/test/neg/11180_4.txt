There are very few movies where only the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. Such a movie is that I was a communist for the FBI. Another example would be I got married with a monster from outer space. <br /> <br /> What's really interesting about this movie is how, in the name of heaven, was it nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category? It is not a documentary in any sense of the word, it is not even in that hybrid category of docudrama. It's just a pretty exploitative movie about the work of an undercover FBI agent named Matt Cvetic who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and became actively involved in trying to take over the Steel Workers Union for the Communists and report on those activities to his employees in the FBI. <br /> <br /> A documentary of that work could have been interesting, but what we got was a movie to adapt to those paranoid times. I found it fascinating that when Cvetic finally broke its coverage it went to the Non-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives instead of the New York trial of the Communist Party leaders. There was a moment in the film where the communist leader James Millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the Activities Committee of the House of the United States was composed of a group of right-wing Yahoos seeking to put their names in front of the camera. Now, what could have given him that idea? Anyway, just connect the dots and, no doubt, the word they got from J. Edgar Hoover, who tries to give some credibility to HUAC by making an effective undercover appear instead of a real test. Little is called interrogation. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers, who produced I Was A Communist For The FBI, later produced Big Jim McLain, starring John Wayne about a HUAC researcher in Hawaii. HUAC clung to the credit for the work done by the Honolulu police to break a network of communist spies among dockworkers. But at least in John Wayne's movie, nobody claimed it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy is in the lead role of Cvetic and his FBI managers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a teacher at a Pittsburgh school who says there are about 30 of them here in that school system that indoctrinates young people, including Ron Hagerthy, Lovejoy's son. She has a change of attitude towards the communists and Lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal destiny planned by her superiors. Ironically, Hart left the cinema and went to work for all places, the United Nations, which as we know, has often been accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> More than half a century later, and we really have. very few objective works on film or printed on the Communist Party of the United States. In fact, they were a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes who stopped them were union organizers like Walter Reuther in the UAW or David Dubinsky in the ILGWU. But since they were people on the left, they simply do not have the following on the right to be adequate propaganda material. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was a communist because the FBI is an exploitative work based on a real life. Character and testimony of those paranoid times.
