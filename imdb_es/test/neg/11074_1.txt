The person who wrote the summary and favorable review for this movie is an idiot or an avid fan of fucking movies. From the beginning, this just talked about a cheap scam of "The Descent", a very superior movie that definitely does not start slow. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of "The Cavern", I was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how poorly written I was, how badly how badly he was. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, and that's saying a lot, considering that recently I suffered "Pulse". I can not believe that this piece of junk really won awards, which shows that the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in Australia and in other countries than in the United States. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the group that is escaping from the "creature" is misdirected, especially the "upside down camera" delayed, with the intention of showing disorientation, but only detaching as an effect cheap for which a freshman would be conveniently reprimanded by his teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "director" will probably continue to make other films, probably of the same low quality as this "movie", since I'm sure he has not learned from His mistakes, which in this photo were excessive. <br /> <br /> If I got my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without parole. This movie is a crime against humanity.
