With a catchy title like the Butcher of Plainfield, this variation of Ed Gein and Kane Hodder will interpret it will undoubtedly fly off the shelves for a couple of weeks. Most viewers will be bored with fools with this latest version of Ed Gien's life. /> <br /> The film focuses on Ed's uproar and gives us (few) glimpses of his Psycho and his abode in Plainfeild. It is these scenes that give the film a much needed shake. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant focus on the lives of other characters and less on the Eds.Big error here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he does it quite well, and deserves more acting. More credits than you get these days. Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also appear. <br /> <br /> 3/10
