Okay, what to say about Actium Maximus ... <br /> <br /> There are some bad movies that are so horribly horrible that they turn around the incredible. There are bad movies that just stink in their own right. There are good movies, and movies regularly, and movies that are simply fun. Then there is Actium Maximus. You can not make a spoiler for this movie because for that you should understand the action enough to comment. This particular movie is worse than Turkish Star wars one and the sequel too. Those movies are so bad that they go around the incredible and make you feel drunk, even if you're very cold. The circles of Actium are round from bad to impressive, but then do not stop there, take another trip to Badville, then rounded back to the unbelievable and finally set up a small feudal kingdom on the border of "Bad" "and pictures of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently." If you like self-punishment, this movie is for you, it will actually make your brain hurt.
