I saw it when it opened in theaters in 1996. I remember that I was already familiar with the work of Elijah Wood (that's right, he did things before "The Lord of the Rings"!) And the marketing links of the film were beautiful . abundant (the "Flipper" water guns were even circulating). <br /> <br /> Adults were reminded of the old movies and television shows and, out of nostalgia, he took his children to see him, who were excited because it was a movie a dolphin and a stupid child. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was not what anyone expected and failed badly. You know that a movie is in trouble when a child moves away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a herd of dolphins scare away the shark, and the child, instead of leaving the water in a boat, floats. in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he has not taken into account that the shark is still out there, maybe even under him. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee farce. At this point, no one remembered "Crocodile Dundee", much less Hogan, and almost expected that he would suddenly start pretending that he did not know what a hair dryer was for the sake of laughter of fish out of water / social satire. . <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very poor "family" movie that is amateurish and almost sometimes hard to watch. I hated it when I saw it in theaters in '96 and now I hate it more.
