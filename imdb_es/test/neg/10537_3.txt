This is, for different reasons, a very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays as if he had to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require a creative edition or a simple replacement. Second, your opponent is a very weak villain. It is an intelligent and petty mastermind, and Chestnut does not comply. So, what about the action? Well, the two parts are shot permanently in different parts of the Alcatraz prison. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of ammunition required, the number of bodies is quite low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line or a single good joke. The little psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So, what does he have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes that move in blue light and slow motion, doors full of bullets and 1000 watt lights shining through the holes, characters jumping in the air as they fire, many weapons coming from nothing, a long black coat containing a bold Black Boy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the last shot, a hopeless approach to lighten the final credits. California playboy Don Michael Paul was writing and directing. At least this mountain of boredom comes from a single simple mind.
