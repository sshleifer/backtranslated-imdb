I just watched the latest Atoll film K-Laurel and Hardy together and known here in the United States as Utopia-on Internet Archive expecting to see some additional images, since version IA had a run time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turns out that it's basically the same version I saw earlier on the VHS tape in Goodtimes Home Video's trading cellar, which lasted one hour and 23 minutes (with the exception that no product was placed on the Welch's Grape Juice label when inserting a bottle) with the rest of the execution time dedicated to the dark white space. While Stan seems to be dying in the short term, he still performs a good physical comedy with Ollie for most of the first 45 minutes. Then, the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man without a country on board, not to mention a charming French singer who also comes to live on an unexplored island, all end in shots with eventual complications that almost dull the comedy . down and never really recover despite the familiar end of Ollie who told Stan for the last time: "Here's another good mess you've got me in!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before the disappearance. In other words, if you are a fan of Laurel and Hardy, this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone who wants to get acquainted with this classic comedy should look for their previous work they did for Hal Roach from the 20s to 1940, when they completed their last Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, even some of the films of L & H Fox (I have not seen the two that they did for MGM) of the 40s are better than this ... Update-8/29/09: I just saw some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another, that Captain's wife pulls a gun at Cherie. In one more, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is bent in high pitch here!
