Wow - Thank God I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad scenes of Hollywood, predictable, terribly acted (who the hell was that horrible woman who made a wife?), Wrong written, poorly written. Apparently, this movie was made to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to kneel on the altar of firefighters specifically, "Heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I just do not have enough bad things to say about this movie. Nor could it have been cheap, with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes. It must have cost a fortune, but it was still worse than any movie I could remember seeing. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. Courtship between the fireman and the horrible woman mentioned above? Corny, devised, trite. A fireman's joke? Not all of us would like to be at the same time so masculine and rude.
