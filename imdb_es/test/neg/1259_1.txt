My website (theflickguy.org) lists "Michael" as one of the worst movies of the modern era. The following is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> "All the slums at some point in their lives, this was Travolta's turn, I still do not know what the point of this terrible film was, Nora Efron has proved to be a Competing writer and director, and what the hell happened here? Archangel Michael takes a new turn here and is represented as a lazy fornicator addicted to the sugar addict and smokes ham, whose greatest contribution to humanity (after having sent Lucifer to hell) was that he invented "queuing up." Yes, how funny and charming, I do not find it offensive, it seems stupid to me, in his defense, I can say that the ending was a little unsatisfactory as the rest of this painful attempt at counting stories ".
