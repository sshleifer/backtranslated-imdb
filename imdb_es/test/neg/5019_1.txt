This movie is totally incredible. The only way a girl would perform this act with a dog is if she had serious mental health problems, a long history of sexual abuse or if she was under duress. However, we are asked to believe that a healthy woman, otherwise "normal", got a little bored and "made a little mistake" and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. What's more, it never again had any harmful effect on her, except when she tells someone. <br /> <br /> She was not raped by a dog or the dog did something she could not resist: she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choosing. She was not drugged or anything that she simply "felt like that." <br /> <br /> The rest of the film tries to put this action in the light of 'hey, it could happen to anyone who is just honest'. <br /> <br /> But really for this to be created, we must believe that this is a woman who is able to do absolutely ANYTHING if she "just wants". Think about it, could you have considered the rights and errors of this action before carrying it out? If he had, he would have stopped on his way. Human beings have instinctive limits for reasons. If we must now begin to consider bestiality as a small "cute" aberration, what next? Child abuse? However, the "heroine" is represented as a very good girl who had a moment of aberration. If an abuser had forced her to carry out this act, the story could have made more sense and she could have accepted the story. But there is no way for someone to carry out the prolonged activity required and mentioned only once, if there is no deep disturbance that requires a great psychiatric help. This in no way can happen in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know that this is just a movie, but it is through the normalization of behaviors through the media that society becomes insensitive and more and more. Terrible realities can be made. <br /> <br /> I could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade him that it is not so important and then continue with his agenda. An abuser can also use it to emphasize that a child does not talk about the abuse, because it looks at how people will react if they do. <br /> <br /> This is not about the truth. The director wants people to think that it's the truth. It is about the degradation and the ease with which people (the public that sees them) can be manipulated so that they accept the most frightening concepts if they are wrapped in the correct way. The spectators are being manipulated, degraded and mocked. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which the actors and the spectators are humiliated and deceived in a very sophisticated way by an intelligent film but extremely disturbed. Writer. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this movie is being used as a vehicle for the creator of the movie to get out of the emotion of playing with your mind in an abusive way. I do not know if he is aware of his part, but it is the most classic example of Mind F *** k with which I have found myself. <br /> <br /> I hope this does not offend anyone. too. But if you saw this movie, I do not think there's more space to be offended by anything else.
