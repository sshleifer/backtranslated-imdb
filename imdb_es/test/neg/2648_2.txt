I went to see Random Hearts with 3 friends, and at first I thought maybe it was just me who was not enjoying the movie. After all, I did not like it As good as it gets and that movie won all kinds of awards. Well, it was not just me ... none of my friends liked him either. It was incredibly slow, a lot like brushing teeth. The only action that is in the movie is what is in the previews. We did not leave the theater because we all assumed that something else would happen. We were not as smart as the 7 or 8 people who left. I have never come out of a movie in my life, but I definitely should have done it. All this is hard for me to write, considering that I am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. I find it hard to think that a movie is amazing, but I do not like it very much. This movie did not even come close in the similar category. The movie not only lasted about 2 hours, it was like two separate stories in one, but they did not come together easily. Also, the "soundtrack", if I could call it, was so annoying. Like Seinfeld has the same riff that is played again and again (the difference is that I like Seinfeld). This movie had this jazz riff that was still playing, which sometimes sounded very inappropriate, especially when people were dealing with the death of the plane crashes. Difficult to explain what I mean, but believe me, it was horrible. I can not say enough for people not to waste their money. After leaving the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my $ 7 back ... sheeesh, I could have gone bowling or something for that money.
