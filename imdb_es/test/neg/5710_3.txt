The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips to the music of Joe Cocker: You can leave your hat! That was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; just the song I'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie, but not so good. Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have expanded. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where he can take it, he drags his heels in a dark way from one idea to the other. For example, when John (played by Rourke) can leave her at the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is surprised by the strange experience of courtesy of John's sense of humor, but less by his sexual exploits involving willing liz; and as one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex, she has to experience the dangerous side is not convincing. This "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the movie and one has a feeling of anti-climax from the point of view that everything could go terribly wrong. The issue of slavery often appears, but it only leads to the edge of danger and then everything goes well. It is the movie that sends the message that this type of "foreplay" is FINE! If the film made a point about the traps of slavery and, by extension, the ugly ramifications of sad masochism, it might be a good moral point. Instead, the film jumps awkwardly from a "sizzling" scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and selling it to another. In a film that could have been good, it falls flat on its face because it does not broaden or broaden the themes that the film may try to relate; so for me it does not have a plot or a theme, just a mixture of ideas.
