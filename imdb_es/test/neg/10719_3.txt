This movie was, perhaps, one of the least original and ungraceful films I've seen in a long, long time. To be fair, I did not expect any revolutionary comic book formula, but I hoped it would at least entertain me. With such low expectations, how could I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (no sarcasm), did little more than step on water in this movie. It seems that he temporarily returned to his funny roots and created a character that is no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly written and poorly written puppy. If you find yourself smiling while watching this unfortunate and essentially boring character, chances are that Carrey is making a great effort to bring you a third dimension. Carrey's extravagant presentation becomes comically awkward and, ultimately, sad. <br /> <br /> Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than provide Abbott with Carrey's Costello. Usually, I find Leoni tea refreshing and underutilized, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily interpreted by any actress between thirty and forty-five, and it is because of that non-specificity that Jane's character becomes uninteresting to watch. It just does not have any defining feature other than following the general theme of the movie, which seems to be ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you count "Big Business Is Evil" as the subject. I thought that was more of a fact. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin deliver credible (albeit tired) supportive performances, but neither of them seems genuinely committed to the role they are playing. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin was trying so hard to interpret his role as the sinister C.E.O. while eating a sandwich (which seems to be doing a lot lately). <br /> <br /> Slight tangent, but Alec Baldwin has played some role in recent years that has not required it. be a powerful imbecile in a suit? <br /> <br /> Anyway, follow my advice if you have not yet witnessed the horror: save money. This is the one that you have to catch on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is no fun.
