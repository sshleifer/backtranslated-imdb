The photography is accomplished, the acting is quite good, but in practically all the other departments, the Greek tycoon is a boring boredom. Taking its inspiration from the real-life love story of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the film is a brilliant but absolutely empty telenovela of the kind that can be found on television throughout the day. Spectators who embrace the whole "culture of celebrity magazines" (paparazzi photographs and gossip stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here. But those who prefer films with a little more substance, art and extravagance will find the runtime of 107 minutes hard work. <br /> <br /> US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) are in Greece on official business. A ridiculously rich Greek shipping tycoon, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), sees Liz at a party in her elegant mansion. Although both are married to another person, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis makes his wishes known to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy is killed while walking on a beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by his death, but it is not long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis. Finally, both are married and their love story becomes a favorite talking point for newspapers, magazines, photographers and fans of the world. <br /> <br /> It is a bit of fun to observe the vigor with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatization of the Kennedy-Onassis story. They wanted the film to look like an original story, rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the film is inspiring. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that the Greek tycoon was equivalent to his love life receiving the Hollywood treatment (if you have to believe in the rumors, he actually had a hand in approving Anthony Quinn for the role of Tomasis!) J. Lee-Thompson is not really the right director for this type of movie? Is it better suited to action forages like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex? but he gathers the procedures with a professional adaptation, without inspiration. Quinn is very observable as Tomasis; Bisset looks adorable as the object of his desires; Franciscus uses his toothy smile and a facade of integrity to become a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but the actors have little to do at a deeper level. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface gloss as it moves from one exotic location to another, but the mere scratch proves that there is nothing behind the film's bright exterior.
