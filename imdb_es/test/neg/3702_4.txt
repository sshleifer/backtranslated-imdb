The Science Fiction Channel films (Sci-Fi Channel) have become boringly predictable. The budget, the originality and the plot seem scarce. <br /> <br /> In this creation, the government is trying to get a lot of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul by cunning means to help. There are a lot of recycled twists on the theme of the evil government organization. Black coats, shadows, short lines and no meaning make these cartoons are one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of the style of his character "Angel" to the role. It's hard to ignore the link that his "Crusader" character was a telepath and this is a movie about telekinetics. Was this a science fiction launching move to try to attract fans of the other program? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a decent actor and it is a pleasure to watch him. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely low budget. It reflects the current model of the Canadian location of science fiction channels, few known characters, few effects and a terribly terrible plot and character development. One might think that they believe that science fiction fans will see anything labeled "science fiction." <br /> <br /> If you want a good telekinesis movie, visit "The Fury" (1978).
