Of the few alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate, since this is basically a scam of William Friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13-year-old Linda Blair with 19 Stella Carnacina, One year old, just to be able to show off her dazzling naked body for free. I'm not sure what exactly Satan is trying to accomplish here, but it seems that he only possesses the young woman to play sexual tricks! Poor Danila masturbates at all times and tries to seduce the priests and even her own father to have sex with her. The young girl is presented as an intelligent and ambitious student of theology with a strange-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving parents, although adulterers. When she takes home a peculiar crucifix to renew it, the ancient relic comes to life and none other than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The excessive masturbation sessions and some sequences of strange nightmares cover approximately three quarters of the film, and finally the director Mario Garriazzo begins with the real exorcism. That final segment is even more shameful and amateurish! The priests do not really do anything other than say some vague sentences, but somehow, Danila seems to heal suddenly. There is not much gore, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate for each small flaw by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell do they mean "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But it's definitely not one of the best. If you like the clones of "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
