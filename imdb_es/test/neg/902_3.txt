Some movies are extraordinary, but nice, but many films are simply extravagant. "Motorama" does not fit very well in the latter category. It seems that many like this due to the interminable appearances of the guests and the total lack of sense, but those two things can only take one film so far, and "Motorama" simply does not have other merits under his belt. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" delights in the improbabilities of the plot. Its main character, Gus, is 10 years old on a trip through an imaginary country that tries to collect pieces of the game to earn $ 500 million. When interacting with adult figures, none of them seem to notice or worry about the fact that they are 10 years old. At the beginning it's incredibly fun, but it quickly becomes too incredible, especially considering the people you meet and the fact that it seems so immutable by the huge amount of disturbing images (for someone of that age) that occur around it. Gus has no depth, and, like an antihero who has no problems causing others suffering to get his pieces of the game, it is difficult to feel sorry for him when he finds problems. <br /> <br /> These problems are provided. for a series of appearances as guests, each abusing Gus in ever stranger ways. In addition to making the weathered plot even more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are equally memorable. The actions of the personage can be a little interesting, but the actors in themselves do not add anything to them, denying therefore the objective to obtain great names (they could have been interpreted by anyone and the personage would have been the same). These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for a marquee value than for anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting: it is a unique idea, but there is very little sense in the script for it to work. . The incidents that should have a lasting effect on the antihero and the viewer do not, as the film quickly moves from one incident to another, with the hope that something will make the audience feel sorry or understand for Gus. That never happens, since doing so does not allow it to connect, it just moves from one side to the other as if they were on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. With a story so absurd that it's no longer pleasant, and a main character who never evolves to take care of himself or someone else at a higher level, "Motorama" has little to offer, except a brat who sneaks off and tries to get rich . Why should we worry about that?
