Undoubtedly, one of the worst movies ever made. Slow and without structure, tension or history, the film slips on the thin premise of "putting together a show". Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their beginning and the dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is in order and, often, "Stepping Out" is more like a spool of deleted scenes than a real movie. The film seems to exist simply as a showcase of striking and totally random musical numbers from Liza. Shelly Winters can be seen at the very top octo-epic "Tentacles", and the REAL Liza can be found at the Showtime release of "Queer Duck: The Movie".
