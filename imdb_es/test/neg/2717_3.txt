It pleases me easily. I like bad movies. I like movies with attractive young women in small amounts of clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives all of the above a bad name. Yes, you know that what you're getting is not high art or anything like that. But, even for the kind of movie that it is, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. <br /> <br /> Some people have given it 10. I can only assume that these are people who have had the organs that allow rational thinking to take place surgically removed. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It's just not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only for the sake of a) novelty value for famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some of the girls are cute. <br /> <br /> By the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
