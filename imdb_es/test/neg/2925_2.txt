33 percent of the fools of the nations that still support W. Bush would do well to see this film, which shows the consequences of the French Revolution and the terror of 1794 as surprisingly similar to the sociopolitical panorama after September 11. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and taking the a ** - the beating they deserve. It is really a pity that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can not be denied the right to vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. <br /> <br /> What really stands out in this film is the ambiguity of a character as implacably doctrinaire as Robespierre; an empty man delighted that the simplistic reductionist ideology can not help him elucidate the limits between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic fire tests aggravate the desperate situation he helped create. Does it sound like any belligerent Yale cheerleader, too privileged and retarded to know? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak blows the scruffy Deparidieu of the screen. As nice as the situation of Robespierres is, it is comforting to know that shortly after the film ends his jaw will be shot and sent to the guillotine.
