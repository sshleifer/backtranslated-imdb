I just saw Fingersmith, and I'm surprised to see the average score of 8/10 for the program. <br /> <br /> It was not only difficult to follow the plot, but the development of the character was applied at random. . <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but in the process of trying to create twists and turns, their characters become completely one-dimensional. Once this happens, the story really fades and becomes tedious. <br /> <br /> And in case somebody does not see the nuances of predictable lesbians from afar, this is affected in the most banal terms at the end. of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final scene is disappointing and he phoned, and anyone who sat down and said "Ohhh, so they were always carpet pickers!" must have left at night. <br /> <br /> Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the previous scene, which was at least a bit lascivious, none for the rest ...
