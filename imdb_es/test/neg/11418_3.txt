My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. Apparently she will look at anything with a vampire advice. I was bored in everything. <br /> <br /> At different points, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans remembers Spartacus, the battle for the planet of the apes, the passion of Christ and the mandingo. What reminds me most are those pictures of Italian swords and sandals from the sixties (not the good ones) that spend an inordinate amount of time showing the Greek or Roman despots with robes talking and plotting incessantly while waiting impatiently for the muscular man hero and his lover, usually the daughter of despots, to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie desperately needed some color and suspense. The characters were quite two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sets seemed to be built entirely of pewter! I wonder how many Civil War Chess Games melted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> All those who wear red stockings on their arms and black lipstick, can click on NO.
