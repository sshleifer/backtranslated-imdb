It's a pity that these guys, the so-called judges, are so idiotic, even nominally "sensitive." However, it is the tone of self-congratulation that really makes me sick; These guys do not have any perspective on their behavior.

They choose the most pathetic girls in the crowd because they are the only ones with whom these guys have a chance. Let's see some real players trying to be a truly unattainable girl, and maybe you have a program. Otherwise, you have a disgusting half hour of self-love. And the real sexual tension takes two.
