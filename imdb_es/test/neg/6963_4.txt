First of all, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director of all time, however, Plan 9 From Outer Space. Coleman Francis deserves that title. I present Exhibit B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly careful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the film are not bad either. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the movie has no problems. Bela Lugosi was totally strange, intoning strange lines. Poor Bela looked like she was not sure what was happening sometimes. The performance was decidedly wooden, although not worse than a Universal B movie. The long sequence of dreams that make up half of the movie was totally strange; more like a vaguely threatening deer movie than a sequence of dreams. The story of Alan / Ann, the supposed original focus of the film, has a focus on quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director of all time. He was able, at least for part of this movie, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do that in Night Train To Mundo Fine (also known as Red Zone Cuba), he simply ended up in chaos. Glen or Glenda are at least visible without the help of Robot.
