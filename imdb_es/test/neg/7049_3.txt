Before the days of home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy 'Kill or Cure' was known, as far as it was known, only because some sequences were included in the compilation of Robert Youngson's film 'Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's'. Youngson knew what he was doing: the best 'Kill or Cure' gags were intact in his compilation, while the rest of this only slightly amusing comedy remained on the floor of the Youngson courtroom. <br /> <br /> Laurel portrays a business traveler, hawking a medicine patent, shouted Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: that name is the funniest joke in this movie, which does not say much. I must point out that this film dates from 1923, the offspring of the Prohibition. During the Prohibition, many Americans bought patented drugs if they had (ahem!) 'Medicinal' properties, so if Knox-All contains alcohol, Stan's work in this film is less desperate than what he and Ollie famously had in 'Big Business', sale of Christmas trees in summer. Pity for this movie that is not as funny as 'Big Business'. <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but we do not hear him, in this silent movie) giving an animated sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we find out they are out of an institution of deaf-mutes, and this man is deaf. A proud woman emerges from the doors: Stan quickly tries to attract his attention by moving his fingers towards her. Of course she is not deaf, and she quickly hits him with her umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, NOT because it involves deaf people (deaf people are not the butt of the joke), but because it incites the misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with deaf people simply by moving their fingers at random. and interpreting Charades without really learning the highly complex grammar of sign language. <br /> <br /> More gracefully, an old maid in this movie has a canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a joke that involves trick photography to allow a man to hide behind an object that is narrower than his body. I've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies, but 'Kill or Cure' is, I think, the first movie to use that I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Stan Laurel, an underrated actor, does some physical work here that is worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, in which he transmits his emotions, and a change in his behavior, while moving away from the camera with your back to us. Still, Laurel never became a first-rate comedian until he joined Oliver Hardy to form the best comedy team of all time. 'Kill or Cure' barely qualifies 3 out of 10.
