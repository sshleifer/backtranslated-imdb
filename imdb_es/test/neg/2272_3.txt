Oh my. Poor Jane must have done the old thing of rolling over the grave. Even taking into account the poor production values ​​for the moment (1971) and the format (some kind of miniseries), this is baaaaaad. Regardless of what you do with Austen, the dialogue should shine (even in this, perhaps your most serious work), and the melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this production. When you reach "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick" of Anne, you will be laughing or crying. Unless you are simply "visually" collecting "all of Austen's existing films, you can skip this one. However, if you look at it, there are small consolations: the actresses who play Anne's sisters do a wonderful job with their roles.
