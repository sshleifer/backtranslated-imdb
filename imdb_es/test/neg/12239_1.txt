I'm sorry for myself, you know why. I feel hurt to see this movie. I went to the theater with some friends to see this movie, and I still did not give it the satisfaction of seeing it in its entirety (I left with about 20 minutes remaining ... waiting for God to make me feel comfortable at least for a moment.) of the movies now, even the bad ones ... when I see them, there may be a small part in the film where I feel some joy sometimes because of an extravagant joke or a good phrase ... this movie the other hand It made me feel uncomfortable and angry with myself all the time, especially because I spent money on it. It was badly written, misdirected, poorly shot and definitely badly acted ... <br /> <br /> please, for the good of humanity, do not watch this movie, even if you are a guy who means you have seen like all the movies in history ... just not ...
