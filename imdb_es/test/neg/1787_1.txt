This movie is irremissibly bad, none of that makes it worth seeing. NO effects, no suspense and bad dialogue poorly delivered. Oh, and neither a CAMP nor any FEAR contains it. Do yourself a favor and go see the original Friday the 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp, but whatever you do, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the appearance of Michele Bauer at the beginning can not save him. Generally, in this type of movies you expect violence, suspense and a bit of gore and some T & A. The violence was poorly executed, the "suspense" was laughable, THERE WAS NO Gore, and the T & A are plentiful IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES, NOTHING. At least one of these things, done correctly, would at least have made it observable. <br /> <br /> To say at least one good thing about this, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands that they are making drugs and, as is logical, they ruin it. If everyone else had fit into that tone, it would have been great fun, without a play on words.
