Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! A plausible plot? Unnecessary! Act decent? Unnecessary! Respect shown to your powerful parent? Unnecessary! Yes, it's another stuffed turkey on offense in Butch Bruce's canon. <br /> <br /> I mean, where do you start with this movie? Well, let's start with the unfortunate misunderstanding that people might have that this was related in some way to the book or the original film, Jackal Day. It is not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name removed. Now I'm not necessarily a British glutton who can not hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well, well, maybe it's a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the premise. A cheesy Russian gangster dies in a raid by the Moscow police (somehow it involves the FBI, although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge, a gangster's brother decides to take revenge by killing the wife of the president of the United States (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move, although to be fair it was before September 11, so it did not). To find out, it would have resulted in carpet bombing by the US Air Force in Eastern Europe). The gangster hires the "nasty" killer (Willis). The police hire the murderer "cuddly" (Gere), "mimoso" traces "murderer" unpleasant. Police fanny around and periodically killed. The cunning "murderer" kills the "nasty" killer. The first lady is saved and we all realize that the IRA is just this group of very sweet guys, you know, who simply want to kill innocent people. Nice. <br /> <br /> Let's put aside the unpleasant habit of Hollywood of playing in the problems of Northern Ireland as if it were a sandbox in a theme park (I deal more extensively with this point in the message boards). If the Hollywood directors want to kick the butchers out of Belfast like prostitutes with hearts of gold, that's up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. Is a free country. <br /> <br /> More atrocious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronize and insult the Irish by trying to support them. That is not politically unpleasant, it is much worse: it is incompetent. It's not surprising, for example, that Gere still looks so good, since he slept for the entire six months it took to make this piece of stone. The fact that Gere's accent is not only from the south of Ireland, but from a heinous parody of southern Ireland shows that the filmmakers were not looking far beyond the United States to make money with this movie. Then there's that beautiful scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says he's going to have a coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" IRA man, then casually says "Oh, but then You drink Guinness, right? Yes, that's right Sidney, the Irish live on Guinness and the Popes. <br /> <br /> While we're talking about Poitier's theme: why? Detective is the tracker In Jackal, Gere is the tracker So, what does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs up and looks like a tw * of course He has absolutely nothing to do other than call the marines at the end , and he only does this because the kind man of IRA tells him to do it. <br /> <br /> While we're on the subject of Gere: why? I guess it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing former Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading through of India of the 1940s and 50. fundamentalist). Let's not forget that the character of Gere is a murderer and, therefore, an unpleasant job. And if it is not, why do you know The Jackal? If it is not, why do you know all its movements? And if it is, why is a cookie so lazy and such an "adorable" person? <br /> <br /> All this serves to demonstrate that the creators of this film did not bother (a) to think about the plot (b) to make the characters make decisions according to their character (c) To avoid the stereotypes how can the big boss, the bad guy, kill his own friend? Honestly, I thought this had become a Bond movie (d) giving the "core" characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a minimum of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the British and Irish murdered at the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the Irish people, it's an insult not very good, but it's a pretty good movie that scams, and a insult for intelligence. But above all? And the most unforgivable? It is an insult to my a * rse to have to sit down during the more than two hours of execution time that led me to finish. Honestly, you would think without plot, without characters and without dialogue, which would end in a short time. But they did not even have the decency to resign before.
