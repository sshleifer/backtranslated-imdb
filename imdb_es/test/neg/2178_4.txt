* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this possible satire, Chaplin noticed the evils of German fascism, interpreting the twin roles of Tomania's dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and one of his subjects, an inadvertent First World War . Hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbor Osterlich while finding time for numerous sets of strangely flat pieces. The very valiant waltz of the dictator with an inflatable balloon is actually entirely heavy, disappointing and not very funny. <br /> <br /> Certainly, one should praise Chaplin for looking for Hitler and for speaking energetically about celluloid, his final so defamed speech is actually the bold and memorable highlight of the piece, but the movie simply it is not clear or funny enough to deserve the praise that often accumulates in it, nor to demand repetitions. The best gags are far from the tedious posture of Hynkel and involve The Barber trying to avoid a large rotating bomb (a sequence that steals the gun fight in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot in his head, accidentally walk the table. the roof of your store. <br /> <br /> Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, extremely inconsistent and, in general, somewhat unsatisfactory, while the sterile spells between laughter are usually long and difficult to bear. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing images and The Great Dictator certainly classifies itself as such.
