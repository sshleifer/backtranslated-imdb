If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not such talented actors, this movie would probably be even worse than it really is. The story of two people with mental disorders who fall in love and have a baby is interesting, and it's worth exploring. on the negative side, the plot becomes increasingly exaggerated as the story progresses, and the musical choices are increasingly strange, so that in the end I found myself laughing when I know the director wanted me to cry.
