Like many other people, I've heard of "more" and wanted to see it because of the music that was composed by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really disappointed, not because of the music but because of the film itself. It is an insipid and boring movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? According to me, from different things. First, the theme of the film, the drug is badly linked to the sunny and inactive atmosphere of the film. This should have taken place in the sordid areas of Paris and should have given birth to a dark and helpless climate, for example. In addition, it is supposed to indicate a descent to hell, but this descent is softened and barely outlined. Barbet Schroeder does not insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could have wanted a little more madness, cutting. On the other hand, Schroeder fails to win the emotion and the adherence of the audience against the anguish of the two main characters. You carelessly watch his drug tests. While the two main actors are perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, you only preserve the beauty of Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunlight. The movie created a great sensation when it premiered in 1969. Nowadays, <br /> <br /> seems outdated. The hippie culture is nothing less than a distant memory.
