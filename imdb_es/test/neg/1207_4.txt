I have rarely laughed so much in a movie. Keep in mind that I laughed at Iron Eagle, NOT WITH HIM, because this is probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of CyberTracker, the monstrosity of science fiction). You must also remember that this movie is not a comedy! <br /> <br /> Even overlooking the absurd plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could enter a US Air Force base, steal an F-16, fly to the Middle East and kills a thousand people without anyone noticing that it is beyond belief), the movie is full of ridiculous action scenes that have little or no meaning. For example, at several points, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to fire a steel beam, a control tower and a tent. All these things explode in a huge fireball. Why? The enemy plane also explodes in a strange way reminiscent of a paper plane that was blown up with a firework. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I really enjoyed this movie. It is true that not in the way that manufacturers probably wanted to be enjoyed, but anyway I laughed and then bought the DVD. It has also been enhanced by the astounding presence of David Suchet as the evil terrorist leader (maybe you remember him as the Belgian detective with the Poirot mustache?) In general, the film is a laugh and a joyful alternative to a more serious fighter plane. Movies like Top Gun. Even if it's so subtly homo-erotic (look at the hug between Doug and Chappy, something is happening between them!)
