The main character, Pharaon, has suffered the loss of his wife and son in the past prior to filming. He deals with simply closing emotionally. A film too long, too much time devoted to Pharaon's expressionless face, too much "time on the road" (one of the prohibitions of television: filling time with cars, trains, etc.). Long scenes of him making trivial, sometimes totally inexplicable. no trivial sense - actions without reason or emotion. His best friends, Joseph and Domino, are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives a new meaning to the phrase "free sex"); Domino and Pharaon's mother are the two characters that show some emotion, but not much. It is difficult to say with all the characters in this film: is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing or simply the indifferent characters represented by good writing and good acting? The characters in this movie speak very little to anyone; It is not surprising that they are emotionally isolated, which is even more strange because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and they know each other.
