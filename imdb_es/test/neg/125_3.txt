It's a totally average movie with some semi-good action sequences that make the plot look a bit better and remind the viewer of the classic Van Dam movies. Parts of the plot are meaningless and seem to be added to use time. the final plot is that of a very basic type that does not leave the viewer guessing and any turn is obvious from the beginning. The final scene with the bottom of the flask does not make sense, since they add and seem to have little relevance in the story of the Van Dam character. It's really not worth seeing again, a bit disappointed in the final production, although it's obvious that was done with a low budget, some shots and sections of the film are of a poor quality directed
