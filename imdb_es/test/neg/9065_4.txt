OK, this is about 30 minutes of gore without any history. There are no spoken dialogues, no subtitles, not even real characters. You see three people in the whole movie (who are alive) and two are there for very few reasons. The main boy has no emotions and only mutilates the corpses for no apparent reason. That is the whole movie. I love watching very bloody movies, especially because in the United States real gore is not very common in modern movies. So yes, the effects of blood were very good. But it's just not really annoying. Why does everyone think it is so disturbing? There is no character, there are only 3 people alive and 3 corpses. Nobody has any personality or background story. You see three separate corpses and you can not really identify yourself unless you identify with death and how this could happen (even though the guy lost his job and went to jail soon after). the spectator has to worry and take care of himself, he must identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie you should really worry about the main character. Here is only one man and one corpse. It is as deep as a puddle made of a single drop of rain. They never give you any reason to worry about anyone in the movie. Everything is a guy who cuts some bodies, then has sex with a body. Now, with the sexual scene here, it's a strange thing, he makes sure to wear gloves but he does not use a condom. Therefore, you could not care less about the possibility of getting some strange STD when having sex with a corpse, but as long as your hands do not get dirty, there is no problem, now that is really logical. I really do not dislike the movie, I liked that it was very bloody, but when it's over there's no reason to see it again, there's no reason to worry, and it's just not a very convincing movie. I say that if you can find it for less than 10 dollars, then you could get it, but if it's more than that, it's not worth it.
