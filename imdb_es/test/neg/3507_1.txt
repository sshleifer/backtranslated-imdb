I agree with what many others have said about the superficial and offensive nature of this film's racism test. I find it disconcerting that so many people seem to have been deceived by their pretension. I want to comment on the character of Matt Dillon as an example of what most infuriates us in this movie. Here we have a man who, in contrast to the underlying message of the film that "we are all LITTLE racist", rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliates her husband and deliberately incites him to make a movement that, as he says. You know, it will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after stopping the couple without any legal cause, but because, as we come to understand, they are black and rich and he is a wounded child who is now a policeman and therefore can do whatever he pleases. This behavior is not a bit racist. This behavior is bad. I am concerned that this extreme of racism is present alongside the behavior of another character, expressing his paranoid stereotypes about gang violence, to illustrate that the whole world is a racist LITTLE. Later, we fed ourselves with a spoon on Dillon's poor father and how the blacks took him to the house of the poor. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is the character of Dillon destined to redeem himself by committing the absolutely impotent and incredible, ridiculously coincidental act of saving the woman who sexually assaulted the previous night? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulating admiration for this film makes me feel sad for the little understanding of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
