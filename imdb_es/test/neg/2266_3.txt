As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh, and no one can play Rhett Butler as Clark Gable. Everyone else pales in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I really could not get over was that Joanne has BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most outstanding feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel they have removed it. <br /> <br /> The movie, as well as the book, had several moments of calm. The new characters were not so memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt as if his trip to Ireland did absolutely nothing. It may be that he is only 11 years old, but I did not see any change in his attitude until the last word, 10 minutes when Rhett told him that he had grown up. If Rhett had not told him that, he would never have guessed there was any change in his attitude. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child better because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. Still, if you've read Gone with the Wind, you'd see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I thought it was going on too much without Rhett. All anyone cares about is whether Rhett and Scarlett are together again, and it took Scarlett too long to get to that. It is practically nothing compared to Gone with the Wind, but again, what is not? If you have read the novel, you will like it better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I would see it, just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of whether it's worth it or not. It may not satisfy you completely, but it will guide you in part.
