I think this is a disappointing sequel. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I do not like it because they do not return half of the original voices to make the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie, and the Red villain is not half as bad as Carface in the first one. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing just to see how the story continues, but do not count on having 5 stars in your book.
