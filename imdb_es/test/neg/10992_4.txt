You know, this is one of those "Emperor Clothing" movies. It's like, so extravagant and strange that you're supposed to like it if you really like the cinema. Well, I think that's a lot of bologna. Movies like this that hide under Dada's cloak or surrealism drive me crazy. Someone has this bad dream, perhaps caused by eating the aforementioned bologna just before going to sleep, remember most (unfortunately) and then put it in the movie and we are all supposed to marvel at his creative genius. I also have strange dreams, sometimes, that do not make any sense, but I do not feel the need to film them, expose them to everyone and call them art. Rarity does not mean, in itself, that something is interesting. Given true or surrealist expression has SOME intention and intellectual thought behind it. If other people do not understand it, that does not make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. The birriedad for the bizarreness, for me, is not good, and much less great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" with "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The Godfather I and II" with "The Godfather III": the same gender, NOT in the same category.
