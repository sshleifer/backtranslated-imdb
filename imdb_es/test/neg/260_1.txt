K Murli Mohan Rao did much better BANDHAN in 1998 This movie is a horrible remake of THE WEDDING SINGER <br /> <br /> Basically, the film consists of: Salman Khan, who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover that he releases his girl and that he also had his comic scenes in which he was very bad, even today he does it well, he also does everything here and also takes off his shirt in scenes <br /> <br /> Jackie Shroff - wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid. Are you shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra and then, in a scene, you are shown as a womanizer? <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar: confusing characterization again <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee- bored, overweight and does not do anything special Pooja Bhatra- tall, fair and worthy actress, but lacks talent <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah- says a dial as if it were poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - poor man, the 2 children were also horrible <br /> <br /> The story is the same and It has horrible comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track by Shakti Kapoo. The direction is bad. The music is decent. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan simply follows the movements, Jackie is bad, Rani is as always, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are not great. Inder is horrible
