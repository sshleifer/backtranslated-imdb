To really appreciate this movie, I had to be there (acting?) Or have been a member of the crew. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am "Selena" and, at the age of 42, I have serious doubts about what we were doing / doing. <br /> <br /> It all started as a kind of "John Waters", with friends acting badly in bad movies. At some point along the line, the fun was interrupted, the people who were supposed to be friends were no longer talking and BAD became worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image I could have projected. (Try fitting gold spandex size one pants,) <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the movie SUCKS so much that it would not even make my mom see it. <br /> <br /> To my director, the cast and the team I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can not we just get along? <br /> <br /> MORE have happened TWENTY YEARS OLD, PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
