This brief theme is a new version of the Three Stooges film from 1942 "What is the Matador?", About the children's trip to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short film was made during the peak period of the Stooges, it is not so memorable and I think it is one of the most mediocre movies with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> Having established that, I think "Sappy Bullfighters" is pathetically horrible, like all the other shorts with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry should never have hired Besser, because his almost feminine and whiny character was completely wrong in the violent Stooges comedy. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the nadir for the team, and those shorts are embarrassing to watch. This short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a good guy, but he was totally wrong as the third puppet. <br /> <br /> I will not review Besser's shorts anymore, because I would only be giving the same biting criticism over and over again. Do yourself a big favor and do not look at this. Instead, try to catch "In the sweet cake and the cake" or "Hoi Polloi."
