This movie really shows its age. The impression I saw was terrible because of age, but there may be better prints out there. However, this was not the main problem with the movie. The problem was that, although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the simplest of scattered dialogues (just a few sentences) in the most amateurish way. Sometimes, the characters' backs turned or spoke with their hands on their faces, all in a pathetic attempt to hide their lips and "disguise" (?) They hide the fact that the film was folded. Well, it is true that this Czech film would have to be dubbed into many languages, but doing it in this way was really stupid and obvious. It just seemed cheap. <br /> <br /> In general, the film seemed low budget and silly. However, it is really a shame, because there was a good story: a young woman who marries an older man who is gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. Even with some glimpses of the naked (and somewhat coarse) Hedy Lamarr, it's not worth all the fuss that accompanied the movie when he debuted. Even by the standards of 1933, this movie was a badly made flop. The only interesting thing about the film is how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the glamorous image that Hollywood created when he came to the United States: he looks like 2 completely different people. <br /> <br /> It's an incomplete aspect and a technically inferior film, I do not see how it has received such favorable reviews. Only for technical problems, the film can not qualify a 10 or anything like it.
