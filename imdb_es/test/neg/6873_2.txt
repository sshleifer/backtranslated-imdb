Here is another movie with dysfunctional main characters that are totally amoral, and yet, should we encourage them? I do not. No character in this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays the car salesman "Joey O'Brien". Man has no class, a loser in all moral senses and a guy who thinks he can talk in any way. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, it was good for this role. The women in your life are also driving you crazy. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays a similarly short-lived person who begins taking the film when he, fully charged with explosives, crashes into a showroom of an automobile dealership and holds. People, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as is normal in him, has a disturbed and ridiculous character. I guess these crazy roles are easy for these two actors. Gee, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There are so many screams and screams in this movie that it will give you a headache. Combine those two cries with the nasal voice of Fran Drescher and you will really have an annoying and exaggerated cast. This is like listening to a chalk on a blackboard for an hour and a half. This is comedy? No, this is lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, a Robin Williams movie that only has a dozen reviews published here tells you something. It is very far from your best movie.
