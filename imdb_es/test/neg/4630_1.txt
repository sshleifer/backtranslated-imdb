A movie that tries to say something and usually fails. Like the fatuous academics who populate the film, it snakes aimlessly, substituting the endless conversation (it seems like it will always listen to it) for some action or plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is one of the best examples of Canadians. The cinema that I've seen.
