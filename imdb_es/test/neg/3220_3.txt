A few weeks ago, in a movie theater, I saw a poster of the movie The Godfather (2004) with the label "The Latin Godfather". How bad have we become, I thought, in Latin just because he is Mexican? Let me remind you that EVERYTHING Latin comes from or is related to Latium, Italy. Therefore, the original boy in the Godfather movie is more Latino than the Mexican godfather and that is why: we call ourselves Latin Americans because we speak Spanish, a language based on the Latin language that originated in Rome now Italy. Therefore, placing a label on a movie poster as "The Latin Godfather" is not only ignorant, of course, if we are trying to relate this film to the original sponsor, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to obtain some credit copying the title. of a classic movie. Now about the movie, I hate to exaggerate, so from 1 to 10 I guess it's 3 the most.
