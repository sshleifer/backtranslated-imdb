SPOILER Wolfcreek meets the Texas massacre ... If you've seen that, do not waste time with it. Typical Slasher movie, nothing new here, except the "visions" of SPOILER, which only add fuzz to a weak frame. I would recommend this movie if it has absolutely nothing to do and is to watch this movie or look at a bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi interesting part of SPOILER is when the girl starts drinking in the sheriff's empty office, I say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy, although He followed that route towards the end. All in all, I'm lame, bad, and not worth the effort.
