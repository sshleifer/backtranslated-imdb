Sigh? The stupid government once again tried to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments were terribly wrong, overwhelming us with a half mutant half man who vomits a lot and screams like a girl when he is upset. Lance Henriksen interprets the honest scientist who immediately abandoned the experiment when he heard that it was a military project, but returns (bringing the whole family with him) when he discovers that his beloved guinea pig has been killed. "Mind Ripper" is certainly a horror movie that can be seen, but it is very unoriginal and presents almost all the clich√©s you can imagine (including the subgroup of rebellious father / rebellious adolescent son ... yawning). The characters are like wooden puppets, the dumbest things are said and done and there is a completely useless sequence of dreams ... it comes from the monster !! There are a handful of interesting bloody scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated locations of the desert are really strange. Lance Henriksen is fit as always, although this is another inferior production that he stars in, and Giovanni Ribisi surely deserved a better film to make his debut. For some reason, this anonymous thriller from the 90s is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes part 3". Is it because it is about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven was involved again, as a producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster is bald almost at the end like the strange Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script and it's always exciting to discover that his offspring are not as talented as you are. Not recommended!
