This is one of the worst movies I've seen, do not see it, even if your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This film by Laurel and Hardy is when they inherit an island, they become shipwrecked and are ready to be hanged. An incredibly boring movie that is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> This was Laurel and Hardy's last film and a very low grade to finish with such a magnificent career. The films of the 40s were not great, this movie was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their heyday, the 1930s. The short films that talk are better than feature films, my favorite is "Me and My Pal. " Another reason why this movie is horrible is because it is bent. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley shit, but let's finish with a high note, Laurel and Hardy have been, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
