This film covers a very familiar terrain: the confusion of art and reality in the lives of the actors. There is nothing particularly novel or interesting to say about this topic and, in fact, it is quite boring. The final scene in particular is endlessly tedious. Seeing the audience crying at the "touching" performance they are seeing on the screen made me ask "who do you think are joking?" <br /> <br /> However, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly of some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who receives a large number of police who applaud his performance when they come to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken again plays a crazy nut. Remember your character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; An aged eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman for furniture and trying to put her in bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an old table and serving him champagne. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was charming and irritating, but above all irritating.
