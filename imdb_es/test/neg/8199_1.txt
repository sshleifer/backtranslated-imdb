The only redeeming factor of this film was the fact that it was on television for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Aside from that, Hallmark needs to reevaluate this division of his empire, and perhaps keep his films more geared towards the strange love affairs among hemophiliacs affected by cancer in Mississippi. To go into details about how carefree this movie is, I would give it credit for being memorable. It was not remember the act of seeing it, there were vampires (some of them teenagers) and some very bad dubbing. Whoever has worked on the dubbing track of this film must relocate to another sector of society ... maybe the food service, for the deaf. If you have the chance, watch this movie, just because it makes many other really bad movies look worthy of an Oscar in retrospect. On the other hand, if you really ended up in the profile of this movie, I imagine it may be too late ...
