Uggh! Hanna-Barbera from the 60s and 70s! What evil cartoons and what can not be seen that pushed us these hacks! It's really a shame, because in the 1940s and 1950s "Hanna-Barbera" means quality, because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the main cost reduction efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look quite poor and budgets were drastically reduced. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never seen the original cartoons. Then, at the end of the 50s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can not beat them, join them", and started producing horrible cartoons with the same animation, backgrounds and writing. <Br /> <br /> It's unfortunate, but the team's crap cartoons production worked very well, making them rich and the most successful cartoon producers of the 60s and 70s. During this time, time and time again, the Bad production values ​​were his norm and a long list of VERY forgettable cartoons was created. In this case, the amazingly bad THUMB HIGH PRIVATE EYE: a completely absurd and stupid idea. If you want to know what the program was about, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> Disgusting to the core and strong evidence that the production team had a total disdain for children!
