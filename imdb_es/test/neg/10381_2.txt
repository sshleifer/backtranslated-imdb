Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about a young woman possessed. Do I need to describe something else about the plot? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrifying and terrifying movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not for a moment. Certainly not as terrible as it could have been a low budget copy of The Exorcist. From the beginning to the end, it has the feeling of a production "made for the science fiction channel". It is one of those films that will probably be falsified and ridiculed in Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar program). <br /> <br /> The makeup and the effects were absolutely ridiculous. The acting was terribly bad. There was not a single performance that did not lead me to roll my eyes or laugh. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The script was not SO terrible, but it certainly was not anything special. <br /> <br /> It seems that through most of the film everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with whom than with the girl possessed by the devil. In the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently, if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon, all you have to do is lock her in the room. Let's go. And if your daughter is possessed, do not worry too much because all she does is talk with funny voices, eat rabbits, try to look at you and put fog machines in her bed. Apart from that there is nothing to worry about. Apparently, she was possessed by a low-budget List D demon. <br /> <br /> There were none of the frightful actions performed by demons on List A, such as sexual intercourse with crucifix, painful body distortions or even vomiting with projectiles. > <br /> Totally ridiculous movie. Not worth even a discounted rent. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
