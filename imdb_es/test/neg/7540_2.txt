The film takes place in Newcastle on Tyne, in the northeast of England, the city where I was born and grew up. The film is also fundamentally dishonest: the way it presents the city, the children, but especially the men of the city. In this movie they are all stupid, violent, thieves, thugs. <br /> <br /> I guess I could comment on the plot (predictable), the performances (unattractive), the direction (lazy and unimaginative), but for me, all this is irrelevant compared to the insult of the director to the city and its people. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the invitation in my summary to the director and writer, Mark Herman, to leave the Northeast.
