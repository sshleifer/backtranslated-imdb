"The best movie of the 90" "The Welsh Trainspotting" ... Yes, of course! I entered this movie with great expectations, and everything went downhill from there. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to be an archetypal movie about the drug culture of the early 90s, and it was going to allow us Everything to see into this scene, and destroy the preconceptions of the media of communication after the moral panic that followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately, it has fallen short. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting was able to treat you as an adult on the subject, and the possible problems surrounding drugs, this gave us a little bit of history of the wonder of drugs, and how you You may like, you know, how to totally open your mind. He mentions some giggles about Bill Hicks and Howard Marks ad nausea. It is painfully bad at times. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt actually made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way that Jip guides us through this story is like listening to THAT A boy exhausted by the acid that you once knew at a house party, that It tells you how "man" is holding us back, and how Acid has freed him from the tensions of modern society. You just want to make some sense and ask him to leave the premises. <br /> <br /> The script was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had the excellent book by Irvine Welsh to quote, this is written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all trade, master of none" come to mind. You can see where your inspiration comes from, particularly in the narrative style of the main character Jip (which establishes the main character in a social situation in which he speaks directly to the camera, and describes what is going through his mind as he is develops the scenario). ) The problem with this is that some of the speeches to the camera are simply painful to watch. Mainly, this is due to the lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like their average A-level drama project. The address is fine, and the intentions are good, but it lacks integrity, so you start wondering what the hype is about. <br /> <br /> By saying that, not everything is bad. There are moments that are really fun and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, he also managed to attract a large number of quality British actors / actresses, which perhaps explains why the film was so enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> The best movie of the 90s? Not for long, but if you're looking for a Sunday night movie, then this could be your bag. Inevitably, however, the film is tainted by the exaggeration that surrounds it.
