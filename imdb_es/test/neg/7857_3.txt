For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, adored for his underlying impudence and ironic comic touches, was quite wet when it came to choosing material. It's not that Lubitsch is overrated; on the contrary, he probably went ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative; however, the projects to which he attached (or assigned) are not the milestones of his comedy. Fans like to label them. With "Heaven Can Wait", a screen adaptation of the play "Birthday" by Lazlo Bus-Fekete, Lubitsch faces the drowsy Don Ameche at the head, and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a musty flashback. The framework delimits the director. An evil man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it", presenting the facts of his life before the entrance of hell. Ameche ... evil? That was the number one problem. The promising opening sequence (set in the lobby of Hades) quickly gives way to a somber whim, and the cast of support is of little help. * 1/2 of ****
