The movie amazed me when I saw the promotions and I went to see it FDFS The movie was horrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London things are fun but slowly the rhythm decreases and they are not funny at all <br /> <br /> Manoj Joshi's secondary plot is funny in some places but unwanted and adds to boredom <br /> <br /> The drug part is funny, especially the monologue of Govinda <br /> <br /> The film continues aimlessly as a small child has written it <br /> <br /> The interval brings a turn in history but by then I lost hope <br /> <br /> The second half starts well, but the way things are handled is a mockery. The whole Arbaaz-Jackie angle is almost baked. Why do not people identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is quite funny although stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not entirely in its elements, from this movie he started making dice and his movies got bad and bad. The music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stands out and AFREEN too. I'm good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white in his stubble and looks old, but he acts well despite this role he has done many times, but thanks to his natural comedy, things seem bearable Govinda He sees out of form, evil and His act, except the monologue, is boring. Surprisingly, Govinda seems to push him too hard for him to return, and Priyan does not use it. Paresh is fine in some parts, but in general just repeats Manoj Joshi is fun in places where Sharat Saxena is fine Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts while sleeping. Arbaaz Khan is bad. Lara Dutta screams to glory but does not act.
