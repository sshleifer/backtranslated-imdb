In the midst of all the many problems that make this an awful piece of celluloid, it is the most stupid plot device in the recent history of cinema. Richard Gere determines who is the true goal of the Jackal through some kind of revelation. He does not solve anything, he only comes to him. In case of doubt "Go after the First Lady!". This movie blows pieces.
