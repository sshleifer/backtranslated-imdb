This is a bad movie. You can not deny it as much as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones is the best he can be with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the way Someone thought that all the shortcomings of the script could be countered if they had to hire each of the actors in the business, unfortunately even truly talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard , Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and so we do not forget that Mr. Jones himself can not fix the wooden dialogue, and trace a progression that did not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> In fact, at one point I looked up, sure that the movie had been waiting. the last 2 hours only to discover that 51 minutes had elapsed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghostly Confederate soldiers that seem to be of little or no help for the story. Apart from detracting from the confusing issue at the end of the image. * If you have not seen this movie, ignore this last statement that may seem tempting and you know it is not, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie may be that it's actually a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners," starring Alec Baldwin, in the same role that Tommy Lee Jones plays in this movie. I may have to see it now, first to see if it's as bad as In the Electric Mist, and second because it seems I can not (no matter how hard I try) to break my man in love with Alec Baldwin.
