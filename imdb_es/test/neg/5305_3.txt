Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knows he wants to make some success in music. Being half mafioso, half expert negotiator, he wants to grow in the music market. However, knowing that everyone is like him and making the good singer Linda Moon record a hit will be more difficult than expected. The first part is fun and full of irony, this falls into easy jokes and has many less good moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. Most of the film is made with a histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a little is good, too unpleasant) and the only one that could be saved is the gay bodyguard, who, at least is consistent, the rest, is too idiotic. . The most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring, everything happens so fast and so many things happen that you do not have time to get bored, if you want to follow the movie. It can insult your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But, well, it's not boring.
