Nothing more than the director's youthful fantasy comes alive. This 'movie' is no more than an excuse for the director / actor to play Kissy Face with an attractive young woman who would never otherwise give her the time of day. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is non-existent and the film is prolonged while the actor / director / writer / narrator narrates. Do not be fooled by the 'X' rating, there is no nudity and minimal gore.
