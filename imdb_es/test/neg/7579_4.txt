I must explain that in regard to this tendency to defraud Asian horror films, this Shutter is a head above The Grudge and Dark Water, although it still does not reach the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that The Ring establishes. <br /> <Even so, movies, like life, do not exist in a vacuum and, therefore, can be compared to other suspense / suspense / horror movies. Honestly, I'm not writing a long synopsis here and I'll say that this movie tries to build on the "startled" fear induced by music instead of in the atmosphere and the "ghost" itself is not that noticeable. The plot is quite basic and predictable and it's nothing special. While there are some suspenseful scenes that border on creative fear, most of the film is pretty vanilla. If you enjoyed The Grudge and it's that kind, then you could enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
