Maybe if you smoked enough grass this would seem funny or it would make you feel nostalgic about how completely deranged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's. There is a strange innocence in this movie and sex is much more clumsy and playful than the diehard professionals they do it for cameras now. <br /> <br /> The real curiosity here, and really the only reason to see this. movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and that shows. She has a classic look, WASP-ish, as a guild brotherhood of the Ivy League. So, what the hell is she doing in this cheap and cheesy movie? From my point of view, she does not seem to be completely consumed in drugs in this movie (which could explain it) and actually seems incredibly committed to the part. When he sings his first song, he really acts as if he thought he was cheating on Julie Andrews or something. I just have the feeling that this girl really believed that this was going to be her big chance or something, instead of the almost career killer she was. Anyway, she is very cute and you can not believe she would even undress on the screen, much less do a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then make the real deal like a climax to the movie (snark). It's definitely not a double body at all either. That's our little Kristine who takes one for the team, or for the biggest glory in show business or something. It's pretty amazing to see it and it's definitely stimulating (ahem) but in a way I wish it had not. That was a very beautiful and talented young woman who received really bad advice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I suppose that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long, long ago wanted this movie to go away. She was very cute and attractive in "Meatballs". Almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl, but it is.
