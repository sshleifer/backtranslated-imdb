I appeared as an extra and was in the place as a journalist covering "The Dain Curse". My participation was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the places in the 1969 movie "The Molly Maguires"). I reported on the 'action' in the newspaper Emmaus Free Press, where I was editor of 1978-80 (the newspaper stopped being published in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention to detail of period costumes, cars, etc. The modern paved streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to imitate a rural city of the South of the Twenties. At that time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a change of system change; I could not interview James Coburn, which was always a big disappointment to me. As a side note, I introduce myself briefly in one of the street scenes with a wing-brimmed hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump" and it was a real emotion. I still have a collection of black and white frames that I took from the production work for the newspaper. Someday, they may be of interest to film / television historians. Lou Varricchio
