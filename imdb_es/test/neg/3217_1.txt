It's amazing that this talentless actor Chapa has managed to get all these well-known stars to appear in this gloomy, pathetic, corny and too-extensive film about a short-lived gangster who looks white but who is half Mexican, much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this film of poor quality receive a script that seems to be composed of a 16 year old. I'm sure this movie is the lowest point of the race for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, which I'm sure. very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey from a movie. I doubt that many people have heard of Chapa and after this terrible movie, I'm sure it will disappear into oblivion to which it belongs.
