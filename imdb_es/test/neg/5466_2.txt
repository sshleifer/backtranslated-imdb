Sure, I like some indie movies. A lot, really. I do not always understand them, and that's fine. Not everyone was meant to be understood, especially by people in the mainstream like me. I am probably showing my ignorance, but I am still surprised at why it is called "Book of Revelation". I love those stories of the end of the world and the only thing I could see similar to the end of the world and this movie was the torture that cost me to overcome this. I'm not talking about the subject; Maybe I've been subjected to all the other tortures / porn I've seen. It was simply the incredibly slow story, one hour and 15 minutes of stretched material for almost two hours. (The main spoilers are ahead) The hetero-man dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped six times since Sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three hooded women. After his release, after his somewhat anguished dancer / girlfriend hardly shudders (apart from dropping a glass) after wondering what he missed more: him or the cigarettes he originally sent him for the kidnapping. Still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to speak, and she continues to work without so much hug as if nothing had happened and he takes a well-needed shower. Issue. As much as he has been tormented through the flashbacks of his "attacks", he is equally excited. Okay, I have not been tied up and used as a toy, but I doubt that I would really "be in the mood". Oh, I forgot, and how do you try to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as you can to try to detect the birthmarks or tattoos that the criminals had. I see where they go with that ?? show a group violation from the male point of view. Well, despite the turn, you could never feel for this guy. The only salvation was the good performance of LifetimeTV's Cancer Instructor / Dancer. But even she could not save the movie.
