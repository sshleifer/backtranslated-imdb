I was tricked to see this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy, they are far away from the brand! Giving this 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best movies of the 1990s" is simply unjustifiable. The big problem here is the lack of pace and a very thin plot. It's like slapstick in Prozac. Everything drags predictably and apathetically. To begin with, the plot is weak: two garbage men poke their cunning neighbor, witness a murder and unravel a conspiracy to eliminate waste, and the film never goes much farther. There are some fun situations and a decent performance, but that's not close enough to save this jalopy from a movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that does not take your fat ass off the floor, why waste it? Your time?
