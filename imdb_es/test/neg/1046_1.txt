"Five characters in search of an exit" has to be one of the most boring "Zones" that have been created. I was on Sci-Fi this morning and, as usual, I changed the channel. I put it on my list of the five best "Zones" ever produced. Boring and predictable, and not worth seeing. Serling worked this theme until death (earthlings in the hands of aliens, who were often giants), and in this particular version, it simply does not work. Anyone who has not seen it before will solve it quickly. This is another philosophical piece of Serling's humor, perhaps parallel to the plight of prisoners of war or concentration camps, where prisoners may lose interest in discovering where they are or fighting their captors. William Windom, as the soldier who is the last to "fall", is the only one curious to make the effort, and it does not take long to calculate the result.
