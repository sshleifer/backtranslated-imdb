After having watched Carlo Lizzani's documentary about Luchino Visconti, he had many higher expectations before seeing this film made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me was dissatisfied ... I faced the need for a critical opinion, which I generally do not like to give because there are no documentaries that satisfy all the spectators. There are also no documentaries that examine a topic completely. But when I read the reviews already written about this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes do not know what to criticize. Therefore, to be clear, I will divide this film into two main parts that differ considerably: the first about Visconti before the director's career and the last about Visconti, the director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that the young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. His effort is mentioned in horse races and his relationship with his mother, so disturbed after the divorce of his parents. We also have a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino grew up as a true count of Milano: in abundance in abundance, with babysitters, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACYA. For example, the splendid villa of his father in Grazzano and other wonderful villas prove it. There is also an emphasis on Visconti's crucial visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met eminent people ("leftists") who later had an impact on his style and message in art. That clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with aristocratic education (a contrast at first glance). <br /> <br /> However, the part about his director's career, which began with OSSESSION during World War II and ended with INNOCENT just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are not discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the work in LA TERRA TREMA and that's fine. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, films like IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are discussed mostly by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like his interviews. In addition, some thoughts that he reveals are not accurate to include in a documentary of this type ... No significant works of Visconti are mentioned as PIECE OF CONVERSATION, there are no interviews with the eminent cast Burt Lancaster. Mention should also be made about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is an interview with Maria Callas that seems to be interesting but that is just a little bit. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, mocks everything instead of saying something really precious. For example, he mentions in the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. That's why I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find a strong point here is the video interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we can obtain your own opinion about your works. For example, I greatly appreciate the words he says about death as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I think it's better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this document. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious at that and the fury of his emotions and views of people usually turned to stone ... 4/10
