From time to time, 4kids brings new shows to your company. During the last years, they brought pure gold like Kirby: Back to Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But Recenetly, 4kids has been out. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without criticizing the program, but in truth, the Weekenders are pure garbage. Spin around a group with a more active brain. However, the capture is something that thinks it is wrong. It may sound good on paper, but after watching it, you will realize how far this show is good. <br /> <br /> The pizza guy is an extremely silly character. It is very one-dimensional, there really is not much for him. It is hyperactive, end of history. Although many think that all the characters are a scam of South Park, I think the opposite. Mechazawa of cromartie High-School is an interesting character, and is able to make me laugh. Tino could not do either. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is not better. Like Tino's mother, they suffer from lack of character. Just stick to one feature and that's it. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the program can make you smile. Either the scene can be really fun, or you just smile because how stupid it is. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very bad show of Disney / 4kids. Although he seems to love some fans, he should really be left to the children.
