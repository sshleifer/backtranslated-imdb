INFERNO begins with a quite impressive effect for a TVM effect of stars. They also introduce us to a scientist named Heller. You do not understand it? Heller, Hell-er, Inferno. So I guess someone in the production had some intelligence. However, it becomes more and more obvious as the TVM advances that intelligence has been discarded throughout history to attract an American TVM audience. <br /> <br /> The story itself is overwhelmed by the subplots with TVM characters in stock as the tough liberal school teacher who is trying to save a child from the house of a criminal life, the doctor who lost his medical license, etc. In fact, the story focuses much more on these characters than on the disaster that all the potential tension and drama that the stage might have had soon rises in a cloud of smoke, and being a TVM, we know there will not be any problem. finished <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen that I noticed and that every time there is an explosion there is a massive fireball that looks ridiculous, not to mention physically impossible. Look at the scene where the national guard is in a fight with a gang. A soldier fires a grenade against a tower and the entire building explodes into a fireball. What a small greanade can do that does not contain more than a few ounces of high explosive! No, it can not. There is also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same effect as a fireball. Can directors keep in mind that high explosive is not the same as napalm? <br /> <br /> Having said that, I found INFERNO highly visible for a TVM and at no time did I want to turn it off. It had some potential and let me repeat that the special effects are pretty good considering the budget and it's not as bad as a TVM as some people are doing.
