I checked this for free in the library, and I still feel cheated. Yes, Sandra Bullock is really into that, but only in five scenes for a total of just 5 minutes, and even those are pretty painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad that you will spend most of your time waiting for it to end soon, but only if you are one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it. All others will simply turn it off. Do not worry, you will not miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming they tricked you into seeing this because his name appears on the case) are essentially a review of other characters' lines, like this dialogue: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny , please tell me what's happening. " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know". <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean you do not know?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know, it's something to do with my dad". <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What do you mean by your dad?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I do not know, he fucked up or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa, I do not know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - "Some friends from my dad's army ..." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "What does it mean" army friends? "<br /> <br /> See what I mean? <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Just say no.
