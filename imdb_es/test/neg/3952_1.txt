A group of young adults opens an escape path for the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they recite their poem from a video game that supposedly represents a s√©ance. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg), who is also found dead in the same way he died in the videogame. While the characters of the others did not die in the video game, his recitation of his poem has triggered the video game in reality with CGI characters who walk and kill each of them, one by one. They must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save her skin. <br /> <br /> If this premise sounds stupid, that's because it is. The characters are boring rejections of WB's bad TV shows, this time they are allowed to scandalize. This movie follows the rules of the slasher, but it does not show much violence or gore. It keeps PG-13 safe and most deaths occur off-screen. There is a scene in which the true hero and the heroine are fleeing from the video game characters that pursue them. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing at all to recommend. The good-looking cast that includes Sophia Bush as appropriately named October.
