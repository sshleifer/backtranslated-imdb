Okay, I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I saw your program. <br /> <br /> It's not funny for me. All I remember was a lot of "strange" noises and screams. I do not think he even smiled. The only thing that in a certain way resembled the humor was its Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston bit. However, I think you can go crazy for the minute. <br /> <br /> Also, what about the "Ask Whitey?" section? Is it a scam of "Ask a gay man? / Black man?" of the chappelle show? Is not it so obvious? But when Chappelle did, he was exposing the ignorance of the subject. Like Borat. But what about choosing random white people and yelling things at them? That's not funny, it's just silly. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure I heard some "jokes" from him somewhere else ... it seems a bit like he's "plagiarizing" pieces and pieces, throwing some "loud" shouts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not funny. Seriously. Do not even waste your time.
