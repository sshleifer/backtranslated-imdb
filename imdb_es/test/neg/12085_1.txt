If I heard the male leader say "This is crazy!" Once again I would have fired. The film is a big clich√©, with false attitudes of "grind it under your heel". No man in this film has a redeeming quality; It reminds me of Soviet-era films with strongly politically oriented messages. I could not even understand WHY there was attraction among the drivers, nor could I wait for the end.
