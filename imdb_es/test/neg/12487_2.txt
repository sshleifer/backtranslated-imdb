A remake can succeed. An adaptation can succeed. It is not relevant if it is a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a bad movie is a bad movie, independently. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I am afraid, it was a very poor movie. First, just by making the characters look dangerous, or males, they do not bring an aura about them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (the character of Amitabh Bacchan) in which we should have been aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh continued giving facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why should it mean something if there is no history or history to accompany it? <br /> <br /> There was no adequate characterization of the characters that worked under 'sarkar'. Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he is wise? ] The flow of the film was generally boring because scenes of the Godfather were created (like the policeman who slaps Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother was killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed by Pacino's instructions) but too much was sought to pack the film with very little history and depth to accompany it. In fact, that was the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of complex details like a Godfather in 2 hours and that also with few dialogues, what you get is a highlight of a game of cricket, never making the full impact of watching a match full will do.
