This is a very famous Ninja movie, but it's not a good movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some figures, you want to know some things about Ninjas see this movie. This movie is only for fans of ninjas and who want to feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are the best. You can see ninja figures and fight in these scenes. Among these are below average, almost bad as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can not fight well. The stage is not good either. It's so simple Franko Nero approaches his best old friend of the army and the war. He also protects him from the Mafia, but is having sex (going to bed) with his wife and his friend knows it, but he does not say anything to Nero negative. Is this possible in life? What friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie started a genre; Ninja movies. There is also the ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some fight scenes are not realistic and they are not fast or shoo. This movie is below average, it's even a classic.
