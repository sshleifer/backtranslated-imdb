For several reasons, this movie is just horrible. Other posters have listed some of the historical errors of this film. Well, I have a secular knowledge of Roman history and I even found flagrant inaccuracies. In general, I forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the purpose is to entertain and not educate. And reducing a long saga to a two-hour feature requires something, say, a historical license. But this movie goes beyond mere rounding. <br /> <br /> There is something worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the film uses flashbacks that make the story more confusing. Unless the viewers have some prior knowledge of the period, they will be lost quickly. In addition, the film was obviously shot simultaneously in Italian and English, and several actors were nicknamed later. Sometimes, the actors seem to be in completely different movies that were then edited together. In fact, this is not too bad. Obviously, the actors were stuck in an ancient Rome generated by computer. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring disaster to any star is because I always find Peter O'Toole entertaining. But that's no reason to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better movies available.
