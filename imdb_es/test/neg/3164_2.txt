This movie looks very good, and that's where my praise ends. "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing" emerged in the same schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-colored nonsense like this co-existed with an art fair as dazzling as "Kiss Me Deadly." As a trend towards smaller and more socially conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" were established in the mid-1950s, other directors felt the need to continue with the ruthless and complacent melodrama that ranks so many other movies of that decade. and "Love" is one of the last. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film of the 50 in which the Technicolor is accustomed to the maximum and the lighting is invariably of a high level. Even scenes that take place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to listen to the song again, because it reproduces often enough throughout the film to last a lifetime, and I certainly do not want to hear it sung by the sharp and penetrating chorus that sings it. about the final titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anyone could have played these roles. The role of Jones is horribly written: his character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that each time his character is required to make a decision about something, the writers threw a coin to decide what that decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly tell me that I am taking this movie too seriously, that I am unromantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows", released the same year and like a corn ball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk can turn melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love") does not it is. <br /> <br /> Usually, I can enjoy the bad melodrama, but in this case I just got bored. . <br /> <br /> Grade: D +
