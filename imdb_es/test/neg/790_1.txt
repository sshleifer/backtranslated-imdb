Now, this movie is the worst I've seen! It is simply a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I just wasted time watching this cheap shit. I can not believe that someone produces such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. There's nothing to learn from this movie, it's just a hollow, sick, evil movie. I do not think they could have made it worse, this movie just won its title as the king of the lowest shit. The acting is a mess, the meaning ... well, it does not make sense only the pain and sadness that the suffering child introduced at the end of the movie, and the murder of the wife, which was again another foolish blow for this film . . Do yourself a favor, if you really feel respectful, get away from this horror!
