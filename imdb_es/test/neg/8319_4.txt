The Brave One is about the presenter of a New York radio program called Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). His life is a dream living in the city where he grew up and loves. She has her big fianc√© David (Naveen Andrews), with whom she plans to get married. But one night, while Erica and David go out for a walk with their dog, they are attacked and assaulted by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers, but later she breaks her heart and is traumatized, and can barely cope with real life. She buys a gun from a guy in the streets to protect himself. But one day she is buying in a store, and a man comes in and shoots the employee. That's when Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. Kill anyone who attempts to threaten or harm her or any other person. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer, and in the process befriends Erica. Erica begins to regain her sanity when she kills these violent people, but she is not sure if what she is doing is morally correct. And as she and Mercer approach, she does not even realize that the unknown murderous assailant is right by her side. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One. She portrays this kind of violent and morally corrupted character. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry together and reinforce the film to a certain level. The Brave One looks visually pristine and transmits excellent camera work, but not everything works with great effect. The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to go out the door of her house to face the world. The camera swayed from side to side almost dreamlike, and really captured the moment with essence. Whereas almost every time Erica killed someone, everything had to go slowly and show her facial expressions in great detail. The slo-mo was used properly when Erica committed her first murder. But why continue to do this effect almost every time he committed a murder? The work of the camera creates a great atmosphere in most of the film, but here are some scenes that are simply excessive. <br /> <br /> The Brave One has a lot to do with how these murders affect Erica emotionally. Her boyfriend is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly his love for New York City turns upside down. He realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and he says it on his radio show. Although I do not fully understand this. Erica acts as if she has never realized that violence can happen at night in the city, and that's pretty stupid. If she lived there all her life, she must be blind or very unconscious. Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhuman and murderous people. She really does not even have to go look for them, they just come to her as if they were asking to be shot to death for their bad deeds. The Brave deals with morality and the appropriate use of violence at the beginning, and then, suddenly, glorifies it. The ending is very negative, completely immoral and inhuman. He also denies the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, that the film spends a lot of time trying to develop uniformly, and suddenly his moral takes a radical turn. Morality in El Valiente becomes very fractured, and simply breaks everywhere at the end. So the violence is fine? Is it good to commit murder while it is for revenge? I almost refuse to believe that. You know why? Because I am aware of what this film surely lacks. It is not right to take another person's life, no matter how bad they are or hate him. Erica Bain intends to stop these evildoers, but in the end it is no better than the horrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard bring a lot of strength to this movie. The Brave contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and incorrect. This movie can look beautiful, well acted and intelligently strong. But in the end it gets pretty rotten. I give The Brave One a 1.5 out of 4. The message is very out of place and is morally wrong, and good acting can not save it.
