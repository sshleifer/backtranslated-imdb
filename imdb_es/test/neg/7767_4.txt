I did not expect much from the movie, so I'm not so disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha said nothing. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's daughter was annoyed to see her in too many scenes: the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents' Night Out". The angles of the camera were not so good, especially with respect to Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a black woman thrown in which her character does not have an adequate exit and very few appearances of homosexual male friends who seemed to have been thrown aimlessly. Samantha comes and goes from Los Angeles drowning the flow of history, especially when it comes to Fashion Week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been done in a hurry because it could have been good, but scenes were thrown to show different outfits or to offer viewers the opportunity to jump into the show without adding much to the story of the film.
