Except for the bright appearance, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was condescending and convoluted. Without exception, the characters were superficial and unfriendly. The female characters came out of the worst ... reduced to hollow, selfish heads whose soul ambition was to run in tracksuit dresses and stilettos, and try to pocket a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The performance for the most part was boring and humorless with the cast playing one-dimensional characters attacking each scene with the same note. This is not entirely the fault of the actor. If they had spent more time developing the characters and the story, adding a little injection of style and humor, MVP could have been a success. What we have left is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
