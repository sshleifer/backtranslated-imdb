I have no idea how accurate the representation of Flynn is in this movie, but even as a work of fiction it is one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and it goes away He wonders how he went from one scene to the next: he simply does not get the minimum information necessary to maintain some continuity and understand his current situation, and it is difficult understand the motives of Flynn and other characters behind his behavior. Add to that a series of silly and implausible situations and you have a movie that appears as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you are asleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it. It is simply strange, disconnected and totally unreal. <br /> <br /> There are many long and boring musical sections of the film that for me are a bad direction or a bad director that tries and is not artistic. <br /> <br /> None of the characters are even nice and the character of Flynn appears as a liar, a thug, a thief, a murderer, a fist bear fighter, a gigolo and impostor who will do anything and he will tread on anyone to realize his own dreams, and somehow, despite all that, the great opportunities seem to miraculously fall on His return. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entertaining or satisfying in any way and, by all accounts, is not even historically accurate, so why even watch it? To rub salt on the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transfers I've seen, not even in widescreen or Dolby 5.1, it had a terrible telecine wobble and many, many artifacts of what looked like a roll of film that had been accumulating dust and scratches somewhere.
