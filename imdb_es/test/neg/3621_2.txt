Zoey 101 is basically a girl named Zoey who is transferred to a boarding school for boys during the first year in which they integrate the girls. That raw plot is, I admit, a pretty good idea. Although this program was intended for children, a five-year-old child could probably point out his fatal faults. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there's nothing wrong with her; No girl is like that. It feels as if the show has put the spotlight on Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is simply bad. However, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of all, which is sad since Dana is never nice. Nicole is too animated and acts like a complete hollow head, but mysteriously she gets straight. Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her acting skills worthy of an Emmy. Quinn is supposed to be super intelligent, and although she is able to create the most unreal things, she is also made to be strange, and she never receives anyone even though she is beautiful and intelligent, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole get guys and they are all from beauty and without personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and sometimes I even confuse them. Logan is unreal rich and distributes millions as if they were dollars. Nobody is so rich. I've also noticed that all the characters on the show are bad for that girl Stacy, who does nothing but be nice to them. That is not fun! That is bad and it only influences the girls to act as totally nice people. Finally, the school itself adds frosting to the unreal pie by providing students with 5-star amenities, such as a quaint place, a sushi bar, a hot lounge equipped with free soft drink machines, a swimming pool and Jacuzzi, a movie theater and the subsidy for boys and girls To freely enter the dormitories of the other sex. In most boarding schools, if a child went to a girl's bedroom or vice versa, they would be expelled. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was badly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process.
