I have been an avid fan of Jane Austen for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I found out, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I ordered it with enthusiasm from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and brilliant comic novels and they have blunted it. Each character seems to have received a unique facial expression, a single tone on which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used all the words that Jane Austen wrote, they seem to have been transmitted to the characters in a random way. Although it was made as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as hurried as if it had been made like a movie of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett is too stern, Mrs. Bennet is just a squirrel, Mr. Darcy as inert as a nutcracker, Bennett's girls almost indistinguishable and Mr. Wickham, a man that nobody would see twice, almost the attractive cad! I'm pretty exhausted!
