Sad and nauseous doggerel with terrible performance; Going through ineptly, superficially and condescendingly all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and middle age. The main actor makes a nervous grimace throughout the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of complacent and self-satisfied self-pity that the valued character and script demand. I'm sure the book was bad, but it could not have been so bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a "Tuscan" lens filter of yellow vomit (maybe the Tuscan sun was not Tuscan enough?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene changes to Rome and (how imaginative!) The Amalfi coast. You have never seen the white marble of Vittorio Emmanuelle's monument in Rome with such a yellow aspect ... I mean, Tuscan. One of the worst movies in history, and therefore, worth seeing.
