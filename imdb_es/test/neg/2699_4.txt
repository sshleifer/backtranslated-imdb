I went to see "Renounce" with much hope, because the "Shower" of the director had impressed me so much. Despite some flaws in the development, "Shower" ranks high on my list of favorite movies of all time for its keen insight into family relationships and excellent acting and direction in general. And now I've seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, "quitting" was not so clear. It seemed like a meaningless exercise and he was so tired of the unbearable personality of the main character that he craved the movie to end. I admit that I've fallen asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still okay to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired the parents and the sister. The device to use all the real characters in the movie is very beautiful and I had never used it. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the disappointment, I will still make an effort to see any film that bears the name of Yang Zhang, simply on the basis of the beautiful "shower".
