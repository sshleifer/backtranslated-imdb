This is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life. I say this without exaggeration, and believe me, I've seen many bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars were invested in this film and that hundreds (thousands?) Of artisans spent so much time working on what the writers and producers MUST have known would be a colossal failure. <br /> <br /> When a 90-minute movie feels so long, long, boring and incomprehensible, you know something went wrong somewhere. In addition, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I have enjoyed elsewhere) is simply terrible in this role; obviously, he was never given a screen test, because no producer in his right mind would consider it entertaining in any way, especially in the form of The Mask. Just horrible <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not wait to see the critics of the main movie critics, because I know they are doing a better job than me to destroy this train crash. <Br /> <br /> The producers of this film should feel ashamed and, more importantly, they should NEVER be allowed to make theatrical films again.
