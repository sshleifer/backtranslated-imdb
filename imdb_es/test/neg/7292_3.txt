When I put this movie on my DVD player and sat with a coke and some fries, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this film would contain some of the strengths of the first film: impressive animation, good fluid history, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and an incredible soundtrack. But, to my disappointment, you can not find any of this in Atlantis: the return of Milo. If I had read some reviews first, I might not have been so disappointed. The following paragraph will be addressed to those who have seen the first film, and who have enjoyed it mainly for the aforementioned points. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, you'll be surprised if you just chose Atlantis: Milo's return from the showcase to your local video store (or whatever), and had the expectations you had. The music feels like a bad imitation of the first movie, and the cast of voices has been replaced by one not so appropriate. (With the exception of a few characters, such as Sweet's voice). Real drawings are not so bad, but animation in particular is a sad sight. The story is also pretty weak, since it's more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the only adventure story we got the last time. But do not get it wrong, they are not very good episodes of Schooby-Doo. I did not laugh once, although I could have done it once or twice. <br /> <br /> For the audience who has not seen the first movie, or who is not particularly concerned about a similar sequel, here is a quick review of this film as an independent product: if you liked schooby-doo, you may like this movie If you did not, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it could be a good movie for children, but I would not know. It could have been better if the return of Milo had been a series of three episodes in a cartoon channel, or on the television of breakfast.
