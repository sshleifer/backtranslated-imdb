Well, I only reached the end of this movie on HBO, only the last 10 minutes or so, but I must say it probably contains the most laughable description of the distance race. It was NEVER filmed! I am a serious distance runner and an enthusiastic sports fan, and before that I have sat in many painful demonstrations in movies. However, nothing could have prepared me for what is shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies belief! The description of the runners is even more ironic if one considers that the African runners completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and elegant. The female protagonist crawls like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. In the race, this presumed world-class runner is surrounded by fat and overweight people, many of whom are WALKING! I find it interesting that the director decided to lead the women's competition, but almost at the end she is shown to people who pass by and who seem to be staggering with two broken legs. Should we believe that this amazing star athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the end of the race? Maybe the director thinks runners can not run faster than 12 miles and, obviously, he has never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you're not a racing fan. You will be surprised by the incredibly inaccurate description of running, and this movie can only be seen as an involuntary comedy. Here is a note for the director: The next time you decide to make a film about a sport, it might be worth hiring at least one person who has actually observed that sport in action.
