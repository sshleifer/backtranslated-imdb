A black-faced man lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in a hut with a monkey. He connects her with a telephone, and she teaches him to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Leaving aside the black face, this short film does not make sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure for long. It can not be said that this is Renoir in action, despite its characteristic humanism. Good use of slow motion, however. It can be found in the experimental movie video series of NY Film Annex, No. 18, I think.
