The producers of this film must be sued for the misrepresentation of copyrighted materials, namely, the Dungeons & Dragons Advanced Player's Manual. Fear and ignorance breed the kind of meaningless propaganda that inspires trash like this movie. If any of you have any doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why do not you go to your local hobby shop and go participate in a play group, so you can see for yourself that D & D is nothing to be afraid of? ? .
