I really do not think that producer George Lucas really did not set out to make a sequel as horrible as "More American Graffiti" turned out to be. But, in retrospect, it was the first crack in his armor that seemed impenetrable. Immediately after the enormous success of "American Graffiti" and produced basically at the same time as "Star Wars", this film was the first that Lucas successfully removed from Coppola without having to bother to direct it himself. The result is the typical Lucas: much more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it is edited than the actual material. Writer / director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen proportions and split screens to produce strange associations in the images. "While it's interesting to see the ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, ultimately, the style only embodies the fractured nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Luke's brilliant original film was all about a group of friends in the archetypal "last big night" before the end of classes and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go to college, one thing that made that movie work, despite from the fact that it is very episodic, it is that you had the main characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end.There is a time disposition, as in Nick Ray's "Rebel Without Cause", where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and acquires more meaning than that specific time in real life would really have, but everything happens in a static space. "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite: space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his ex-girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) participated in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drags careers in the semi-professional circuit. In a meeting devised at the beginning of the film, all the principles come together to see John run, but after that, the threads do not rejoin and intertwine as they do in the original. Instead, they separate and follow the characters for about 3 years, just watching several events on New Year's Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to get confused, and I think it's fair say that we do it Although the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages in an unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few points of the plot of the epilogue of the original and tries Turn them into a coherent film. <br /> <br /> For me, the best parts of the movie are those with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes fall, but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a clear contrast to each other A good movie could have been made if these parts were a little better, and if the other parts were not so difficult. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to an exchange student was really boring, not funny, and throwing Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo did not help at all. It was just another artificial moment, as when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the film because he is already in Canada. In contrast, Laurie only has another brother who is basically identical to Curt, but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There is a kind of black satire in some of the things in Vietnam, very similar to what I imagine would have been the original idea of ​​Luke and John Milius for "Apocalypse Now". And there's some manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But even with those funny things, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if someone wanted to see Steve and Laurie arguing in their horrid suburban residence as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think that even if those parts of the film were not so painful, they would still not be comparable to the first movie because there is not a closure or a feeling of coming back together or that someone has learned something. It just ends at the time they ran out of money or something, a cheap imitation of "Two-Lane Blacktop" and many better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, however, this film has a great soundtrack of vintage hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie tasty. The performances of Country Joe and the Fish are great, and Scott Glenn, considered a hippie in love with Candy Clark, is something worth seeing. I wonder if even then I had to wear a wig. I could not recommend this movie and yet, it has a little bit of affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I guess I have to try this movie just to make sure it's as useless as I remember it. He's a party killer, but it's something that all fans of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a great effort can go into something and can still be quite half-hearted. It makes you reflect on how miraculous it is that Lucas made a film as good as "American Graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been appeased. Unfortunately, this was not the case with this movie or Bill Norton.
