I still have to see the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, I could still follow the complex and intricate plot, with all its twists and turns, and I applaud you for the absolute originality of the concepts contained herein. In case there is any confusion, I have no doubt about the fact that everything I have just said is covered in pure and carefully nourished sarcasm, the kind that blooms and grows exponentially when exposed to this shit. A clear sign that this is not impressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a Henry Rooker film that was not well received. The acting is normal at best, and I challenge anyone I do not find ... Scottish Russian actress (come on, seriously, what about that last name?) The Russian accent is laughable and / or irritating. There is an attempt or two of stylization in this, and they are reasonable. The action is not terrible. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is great enough. Language is infrequent, if that is so. The violence is pretty bloody. I recommend this only to fans of B movies, and I'll say you can do worse than this. 1/10
