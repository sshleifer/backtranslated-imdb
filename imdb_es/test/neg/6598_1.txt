The writers and creators of this movie should be sued ... For polluting the world with this shit! "The man in the mirror" is, in fact, more than horrible! Way, way, beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not just saying it because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most backward representations of his life that I have found! <br /> <br /> I say it because it is a waste of time, money and celluloid! I feel ashamed of having seen it all! That's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life that I'll never go back! I'm telling you; Seeing grass grow is literally more entertaining than this movie! <br /> <br /> They consider themselves warned!
