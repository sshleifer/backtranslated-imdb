This and the previous "The Revenge of Toulon" and the next seem to be completely different from the first two films where the puppets were not so nice. It's basically choosing your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as murderers, while the next three are a series of them that are the good ones. This looks a lot like a cheesy TV show episode that is as good as the third part was and I never really needed to try to see part five of the series. Basically, a child gets the puppets while a strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets to kill, this dark lord seems to be some kind of enemy of one of those Japanese live action shows like Ultraman. The movie ends before you know it, so you have to get credit for not having caused a very painful movie. Only for many holes in the plot and things in it to be considered a good movie. You can see the guy who played in Toulon in the last movie, but then you have a very anti-climactic battle and you just finished the movie before it really starts.
