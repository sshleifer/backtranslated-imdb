Herman has endorsed the drama of the north with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this story of two teenage delinquents trying to get seasonal tickets to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Absence, minor smoking and drinking, sex with minors, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child violence, sexual abuse with children, robbery in stores, car theft, violent assault and armed robbery. None of these topics are explored, they simply serve to move the story from one unlikely situation to another. The film is not as keenly observed as Trainspotting, as poignant as The Full Monty, or as reflective of the times as Wonderland (from which he outright steals music in an excessively manipulative way). I suspect that none of the filmmakers is from Newcastle, and they certainly have never experienced the social problems that the film references. I am in favor of entertainment, and Herman's record shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. It just seems incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The movie has a nice ending, but there are too many flat and banal moments to sit and get there. Very well filmed, not very well acted, and ultimately fails on three crucial points: script, script, script.
