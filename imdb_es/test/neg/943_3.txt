Let me start by saying that there really is no reason to see this movie. I just sat through it because I was trying to kill some time before going to work. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" aimed at teenagers. There is nothing extraordinary about this, other than the complete ridiculousness of the story, not to mention that there are parcel holes large enough to navigate through a Carnival cruise. Obviously, this is not supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. Unfortunately, most of the time it also fails in that account. I must admit that I laughed a few times, but especially in a "sacred party, I can not believe how stupid it is" something like that. <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, you will. "I do not lack anything.
