The female high school star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach George Michaels (Christopher George interprets it as an important headbutt that is VERY demanding of the athletes under his supervision). It will be canned after the school stops providing the film with its motive as a possible killer. Some psychopath twisted into sweats (much like what Michaels is often seen wearing), using a stopwatch to time his executions, murders members of the track team the dead runner was part of. The parents soon feel disturbed and call the director Guglione (Michael Pataki) wondering why his children did not return home after a graduation party. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) starts snooping on campus at the request of concerned parents. Instantly, a wealthy Michaels becomes the prime suspect after a gymnast's body is in a locker. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home from her base in Guam to receive the diploma of her dead sister and soon faces the killer on the scene of the climate chase. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is the tired boyfriend of the star of the lost track. <br /> <br /> Slasher, quite slow, distributes the sequences of death trying to mix the humor and failing miserably. Low-quality death sequences only increase laughter, such as a sword embedded within a soccer ball thrown into the stomach of a soccer player or a pair of garden scissors that decapitate a poor soul that runs away. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as the horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases a male stallion (the receiver of the garden scissors before she has a chance to sleep with Dolores outside of Graduation party). Vanna White plays an early role here as a silly blonde who discovers the body of the dead gymnast in the closet. Virgil Frye has a foolish role as an inept officer.
