I think the cheaters should be off the air and finish the reality show once and for all. I do not care what others say, you can attack me or agree with me, but it is at this time that the program is only launching propaganda and the host. of the cheats Joey Greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people to the camera is effective and without realizing it not only shows that it is disgusting. It is also the interception of calls and the tracking of people by "cheating spies" is illegal and a federal offense that we are living. In a police state like the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, I am happy that there is bad criticism about this garbage, this has to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation, it is not surprising that our country goes to hell. Because of this and other trash programs, I liked the older programs from the 1950s-80s. I hope everyone agrees with me that thank you, infowarrior.
