Do I need to say more? The reason why the GOOD Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, was its hilariously funny originality. The reason why this new American version is so terrible is because much of it is taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity of the characters. Kath is destined to be a dag. Kim is destined to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they have nicknamed him) is bound to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is destined to be a loser, not a person who acts like he's taking heroin and ends each sentence with "friend." Thank God, Szubanski did not sell his rights to Sharon, he would probably end up being a tall, thin blonde that Kim likes. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. They are not destined to be separated by 2 years. And they're not meant to laugh like the girls at school. This show is a shame even to share the same title as the Australian version. America: get your own television shows.
