After reading the novel which is about an hour of reading, watching this movie became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in Prince of Egypt, simon's wells managed to direct a script that eliminated all the drama and mystery of its source and turned it into this homogenous nonsense. Now I love cheese and camp, but this movie does not make any sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or in any humor. There were no emotions and that stupid bookend with Addy, the character of Filby throwing his hat in the air, was the last straw to write. I felt very violated when this movie ended and I still refuse to believe that it only lasted 90 minutes and lasted forever. I wondered how the studio and the director could have approved such a bad script, but then my friend threw the film at me exactly as it was and I said it sounds good, but what happened to the movie?
