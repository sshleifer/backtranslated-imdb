Obviously, with this movie going directly to the DVD, I did not expect much, but this movie is so funny that it's amazing. The only part of the movie that really can be remotely funny is before they get to the island, where a stream of water drains into the bathroom from Eddie's bathroom and that's it! Why do they bother at all? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were bright and fun. This is not. They are based on jokes about a dog with flatulence, and a character named Uncle Nick, who is about 80 years old and tries to get away with beautiful women. When they approach the island in the boat, the island in the background looks so fake and Randy Quaid, although funny in the previous movie, exaggerated and seems to be trying to be funny. You have been warned!
