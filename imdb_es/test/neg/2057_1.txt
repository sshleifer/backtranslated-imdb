This movie is probably one of the 3 worst movies made in history. I rented this by chance, without reading reviews, and wow, I'm sorry. It really has no plot, it really does not follow the genre of vampires. Simply my horrible God. Watching this movie will stain your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt that the writer / director / producer took this drug binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it in a movie. All the time I wanted the movie to end ... but the ending was even more hit. <br /> <br /> If this revision can prevent only one person from seeing this crap, I felt that the time I spent registering and writing this review was worth it.
