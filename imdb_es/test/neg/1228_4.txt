I, like many people, believe that the epic lonely dove of 1989 was one of the best Western films produced, perhaps the best. And, realizing that most of the sequels (in this case a prequel) will surely disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon fulfilled that expectation with his marginal direction and performance, scant distribution and, frankly, bad writing. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove created the Western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to the incredible performances of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believed that they fought valiantly to rid the bandits and wild Indians of Texas during their waking years. <br /> <br /> If only I had seen Comanche Moon, I would think that these two bone heads were a pair of incompetent and cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae allegedly pursued Blue Duck throughout Texas and never managed to capture or kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot in the heel of Call's boot convinced him to settle and raise cattle. There was not a fight of punches or decent fights in the entire miniseries. The best blow was McCrea sucking Inez Scull, a funny scene but out of place for McCrae. <br /> <br /> Where was the wit and charm of McCrae? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken lazy, unshaven and fil√°ndrico was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original one. The credit goes not only to HD technology, but to the cinematograph. The miniseries Comanche Moon was better than anything else on television for three nights, but unfortunately that does not say much.
