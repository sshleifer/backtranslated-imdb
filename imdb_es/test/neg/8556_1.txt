How can any of you call this propaganda a family movie? This is no more than a PC, an insensitive insult to the parishioners of small towns. The film presents a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern city, and everyone else in the city (mostly men) are simple damsels in distress, unable to honor, who can not fend for themselves and they have to trust in the main character of the redemption. This film is just a love story that the producer has with a trickle of undisciplined, arrogant and aggressive, whom he expects the audience to admire. <br /> <br /> The person who made this film probably spent his entire life in a church sensitive to seekers, and had the freedom to throw garbage at members of small churches like crazy fools and not like most. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army at Christmas, collecting donations to help the missionaries, the poor and the homeless, singing, sending friends and making friends among them. What is wrong with this humble group that offends these traitors who justify themselves? Most Christians in this world stand in front of a train and give their lives for anyone in trouble, even if they do not agree with them. Most Christians would not care if the pastor, or some church worker, of some church took off his coat (or his outer shirt). They would not condemn it. This movie is ridiculous!
