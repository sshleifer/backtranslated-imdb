I have a lot of respect for Mr. Argento's work, but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films truly unique. The opening of the film is excellent, and it prepares you for the possibility of a really scary horror movie. What happens for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not accumulate much. However, there are some good performances and a great atmosphere. The end of the film is weak considering everything that this constitutes. Where there should be a great climax of enormous proportions, instead, you get a very typical conclusion that many other horror movies use, making it look like they just needed to finish it. A couple of scenes are very memorable for their images, but in the end the film does not gel to make a really good movie. Unless you feel that you should see everything that this director did, I suggest you move on to this ...
