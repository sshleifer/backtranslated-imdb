This movie was more than horrible, it was a grain in the a * s of the film industry. I know that each film can not be a success or, in reality, an average, but the responsible parties that came together for this epic failure, should have been able to see that they had a time bomb in their hands. I can not help but think that the cast would be united between scenes and they would console each other for being in such a mass of manure. I can hear it now, "Are they paying you?" "Not you?" I understand that this movie was more than likely made in a shoe string budget, but even with that in mind, it could still have been better. You wait for the appearance of a monster / creature and when you finally see it, it's a big yawn. I'm so mad at myself for spending a 1.07 on this stench !!!
