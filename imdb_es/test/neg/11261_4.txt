I have read all Dave Robicheaux's novels and consider James Lee Burke as my favorite writer of contemporary fiction. I have also visited New Iberia and a large part of Acadiana to better visualize the scenario in most of these books. Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing "In the Electric Mist", especially because I thought that Tommy Lee Jones would be fantastic as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interaction with the "ghosts of the Confederate dead" was superficial and lost the impact and nobility that added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was sad, expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable movie is to add my "ditto" to a comment from a previous user that this movie was like one of those old movies made for television. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any moment. <br /> <br /> The location settings were accurate, and the photograph sometimes captured the essence of the puffs of smoke, the smoldering and spooky shells on top. land graveyards of southern Louisiana. Too bad that the unconnected presentation of Tommy Lee's history and mediocre performance interfered with the unique atmosphere and spicy flavor of the region. <br /> <br /> Next to the final comment: in the novels, the nickname of Dave Robicheaux is "Streak" due to the clear wick of silver gray hair on the side of his head. (Similar to the way Paulie Walnuts of the Sopranos would appear if only seen in profile). Tommy Lee did not have a similar streak in this movie, probably because the editors are fans of James Lee Burke and made a break after witnessing the work of Mr. Jones. poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> Final comment: Although overall I find Alec Baldwin as pompous and unpleasant in most roles, Robicheaux was much better in "Heaven's Prisoners" than Tommy Lee was "In the Electric Fog." In addition, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly credible performances and a more evocative atmosphere than this new film. <br /> <br /> "In the Electric Mist" is fine to see when one feels like "veging out" And there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are infomercials.
