When one of my friends recommended this to me, talking about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing movie, at least entertaining. <br /> <br /> The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a big waste of time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surrealist films, there is something that anchors it down, even if it is only in the least. This film, on the other hand, felt forced and false. Many of the shots were unnecessary and seeing it made me think that the director was trying to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was bad and the relationships between the characters were not sufficiently developed. Maybe I just need something that others could see, but I had not even realized that there was some kind of attraction between Dae and Migo before they started doing it like random rabbits in the middle of the movie. On the other hand, maybe this movie was just bad. <br /> <br /> I am not against violence in movies, but in this, almost everything was simply unnecessary. Throughout all the fighting scenes I felt crushed by how painfully it was all a clich√©. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would have fun if I had not wasted two hours of my life following this ill-conceived and ridiculous plan. Despite all the shortcomings of the film, at the end of it, I expected something interesting to conclude. I will not discuss the ending, because I would not want to "spoil" the film for those who have not seen it. Only the metaphor "Either a rock or a grain of sand, in the water sink the same". It can not be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made only for the shock value and the shock value. I just hope that sooner or later people stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I've seen many other great Korean films and it's depressing that people have considered Oldboy the best.
