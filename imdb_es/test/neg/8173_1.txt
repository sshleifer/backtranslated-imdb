I used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately I feel that it has become a kind of emotional soap. If you look at the promotional photographs / posters of the bill now, you will see two of the officers hugging / kissing or something related to friendships, while promotional photographs of the bill from long ago would have shown something to do with the crime . This shows that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely incredible police drama to an average type of soap opera. When I see it, I feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say that I still like the bill because I'm interested in the work of the police and that kind of thing, but I really miss the greatness that the Bill used to have. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit that the people who took over the bill ruined it completely. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the characters, both have gone downhill, most of the great characters have already left (although I think there are still some left) and I'm not saying that the newest characters are poor or nothing because they definitely are not, it's just that they lack the harsh look, the personalities and the script lines that all the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are involved at the moment with silly relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> In general, it is one of the only police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be a very interesting thing to watch, but as I said, it has lost much of its uniqueness (if it's the correct spelling) and now it would be classified as a terrible and unreal television soap opera. <br /> <br /> Recommended to keep a good laugh at the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
