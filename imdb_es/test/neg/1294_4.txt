After a large budget of disaster films, set in the United States like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was comforting to see something on a smaller scale like Flood. <br /> <br /> Using mostly unknown actors and actresses and focusing on England was a welcome change of pace to see that the Empire State Building was demolished. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a solid movie in any case. While it's quite shocking to see that all of your favorite London landmarks were demolished by a very false CGI storm surge, Flood really does not offer anything else. <br /> <br /> The performances are vapid, they are saved from hell by David Suchet and his calm and calm acting as Vice Minister. Maybe he's too calm for what's going on in the movie, all that fake water gushing out in London must have made him rather annoying. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that the effects will not be as good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was, at best, average. <br /> <br /> Soda, disappointing and, sometimes, even boring. Look at it if necessary, but look something else directly afterwards.
