* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a parody of a movie! He is now in Italy, appreciating our food (including people, like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but returns to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even for scoring with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). . <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this movie does not deserve to be mentioned together with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it is truly, absolutely, absolutely, BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's skull opened and he was forced to eat part of his brain saut√©ed? WTF? So, why was HELL the whole world so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did not the story go nowhere? I guess this is the 'teen' chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, bloody for the love of God and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, especially if you love other Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
