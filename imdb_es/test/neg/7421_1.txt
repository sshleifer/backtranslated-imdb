Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) takes a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and is still out there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was a night when I put this on my DVD player. Seriously I wish I could go back in time and stop. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be the movies I wish I had never seen. Incorrect. This will be. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of crap, but this is the only crap that has haunted me. How I wish I had never seen this! Acting is not really that bad. It's just the writing and the direction and the rhythm and everything! Actually, I'm a fan of Sasquatch movies. But it is not. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to my warning. Do not look at this!
