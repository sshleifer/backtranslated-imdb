I found this Robin Williams vehicle slightly fun at best. I guess I would call it a kind of political satire. He is a comedian / comedian of a political talk show who decides to run for the presidency and unexpectedly wins. , and Robin Williams is much more restrained and calm than usual. I would say that the film is more a drama than a comedy, with a bit of mystery and suspense. I think the dramatic parts worked better than the parts of the comedy and the mystery. and the suspense aspect (although it is a small part of the movie) was the one that worked best. Even so, I would not rate this movie as very high. For me, it was an acceptable waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. My best advice would be to capture it on TV / cable or rent it first first, before making a decision about whether to buy. My vote for Man of the Year is 4/10
