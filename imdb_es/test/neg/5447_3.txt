I'm really not sure why people are so appreciative of this strange movie. Having said that, I really sat down for the entire 2 hours and I can not say that it was not entirely entertaining. <br /> <br /> I think the key problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and this is clear in the film: he is an experienced producer, so he will have seen a movie several times and will understand what is involved. process. But I think this is very different from being able to truly direct a film: the direction was competent, but somehow flat and without direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and this was reflected, I believe, in the finished product: it seemed to be a group of sets that did not really have any continuity either in their style or in their character. <br /> <br /> Funny, observable, but good? Do not.
