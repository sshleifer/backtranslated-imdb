This proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with British funds; unfortunately, the result is not distinguished (except for its excessive displeasure and focus on the border field) despite the stars and the director. The first is led by a Franco Nero of wood and an ultra hammy Telly Savalas as a pair of possible thieves (if someone is able to believe any of the actors who usually exude cool as a duo of criminals, is more gullible than I am !). <br /> <br /> Your 'job' goes awry (ending in murder and loaded with boxes of cutlery instead of jewelry!)? however, the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently "kidnap" the son of a British diplomat (a Lester, who can even kick Savalas, a happy trigger where it hurts at any given moment). However, they never rescued him and his only intention is to cross the border into France; Along with them is the girlfriend of Nero (a wasted Ely Galleani): soon, however, he has had enough and decides to flee while the others sleep; The crazy Savalas realizes this and, following the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester have woken up. the first believes that his accomplices may have betrayed him, so he takes risks with the child on his back; After a brief period in a country house of a rich old woman (who has totally free nude butts from Nero and Lester!), Savalas catches up with them. They continue their walk, where the trio meets a family of German campers: the situation degenerates to the point where Savalas closes them inside his trailer and throws the lot into the river. although he himself is seriously wounded in the process; In general, everything ends with the death of the "heavy" just when they are about to reach the border. <br /> <br /> The film, therefore, contains most of the typical elements of the genre. sordidness, sadism, violence, persecutions (the aftermath of the opening robbery when the car of the game wreaks havoc in the narrow streets of the city and even interrupts a funeral procession is frankly ridiculous), etc. A slightly interesting aspect is that, in the end, is Lester himself definitely (irrevocably) marked by experience? Getting to feel enthusiasm when an act of violence is committed.
