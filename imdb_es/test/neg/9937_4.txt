The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was recorded on video, so it has that peculiar aspect of "home-video-ish" that distracts terribly and makes it difficult to take this seriously as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" actually seems as if a group of amateurs come together to try a real "serial killer thriller". It's not exactly that, but it's not as bad as it seems. Having a woman as one of the two detectives in the case gives a twist to the genre of exploitation. Dona Adams offers an attractive amateur role in the role: her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Also, she puts a BIG fight against the killer at the end. The false clues seem ridiculous at first, but ultimately they work. I incorrectly assumed the murderer. And you have to wonder if perhaps Tarantino had seen the Zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
