When I first saw this movie, in the 80s, I loved it. I was totally fascinated by music, dancing ... everything. However, recently I saw it all on DVD again, and I was completely surprised at how stupid the plot was, how it contained holes, inconsistencies and, frankly, a lot of garbage, and how horrible the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, I would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertoire ... Everything was quite pathetic. The developments of the character also lacked depth. I think this was, to a large extent, a product of the 80s: the movie does not hold today!
