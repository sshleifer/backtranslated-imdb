William Petersen (that guy from C.S.I) has a small uncredited role, but it's the best part of the movie. His character is smart and tough, and it's a funny surprise to see him in this. It has a range that allows you to play almost anything. After 5 minutes, it goes from looking great to nothing. It leaves you with the hope that your character reappears in the movie, but after 20 minutes you lose hope. The movie itself is quite poor. It's worth looking at TMN or picking up at the library but not much else. Too much of that reminds you of L.A Confidential, except that when the movie starts to get complicated on its own, it is so loose that it goes everywhere but where it should go. 2 out of 5 stars
