I understood before seeing this movie that it would be a low budget movie. But even with those low standards, this movie does not cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had little budget or had bad performance, writing, direction, sound, music and editing. I was hoping that all of that was bad, and it is. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it did not even do a good job in the guts and gore. Most of the 'action' happens off the screen and all we can see are the side effects, which seem very false, even by the standards of low budget movies. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for the gore to be so badly done. Peter Jackson did the 'Bad taste', on the same budget, almost at the same time and, somehow, was able to produce much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this film. <br /> <br /> A flaw in almost all Level, I can not recommend this movie to anyone. Stay away from this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
