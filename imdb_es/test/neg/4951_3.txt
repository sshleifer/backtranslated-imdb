After watching "Still Life", a short film directed by Jon Knautz, he was really excited for his film debut, "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer". "Still Life" had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and was eager to see what Knautz could do when he faced the horror comedy genre. The cheesy nature of the name and the promotional materials suggested something like "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness"; A fun, bloody, 80's horror movie style with lots of monsters. While that was what Knautz was looking for, it completely fails to capture the fun or entertainment value these movies had. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that it completely lacks comprehension. What these comedies of terror did, which he tries to evoke, so great in the first place. Two-thirds of the execution time is mainly devoted to the movie's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student, while he attends class and tries to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger. There is not a monster in sight for most of the movie, just a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at something related to horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had the following amounts of blood cut, they would still be entertaining. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's just boring, which is the worst thing a movie of this nature can be. Jack Brooks himself is not so interesting, at least not enough to guarantee the amount of screen time he has given him. Everything one needs to know about him is revealed in the first ten minutes of the movies and, from that moment, every time he does not defeat a monster (and rarely does), it is not worth seeing. The film is not going anywhere, it follows him in psychiatric sessions and fights with his classmates. <br /> <br /> Eventually things recover. Jack Brooks fights a few monsters, some heads are crushed, a few humans are killed, and then it's over. A) Yes. All within the lapse of about fifteen minutes. It's a good fifteen minutes. All the monsters are quite inventive (and they are made completely in camera) and there are some geniuses gags (the best thing is to be a head of squashed zombies), but after spending seventy-five minutes of pure tedium, fifteen minutes are not enough. Cut it. <br /> <br /> That's really all there is to it. I could ramble on about the performance that's pretty well done (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and about how prosthetic creatures are a good reminder of the days when movies did not use CGI, but really not what make. It does not matter "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is absolutely boring and, although Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to create a good movie (once again, the last fifteen minutes are killers and "Still Life" was amazing, check it out), "Jack Brooks" completely loses the mark. It has its successes (acting, makeup), but that does not change the fact that it is not entertaining at all. The projection in which I captured this had the director and the cast. One information I got was that a sequel was being developed and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters instead of "the creation of a hero." My advice: skip this and wait for the sequel.
