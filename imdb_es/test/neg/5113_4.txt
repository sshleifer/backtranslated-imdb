The Orson Welles documentary, "F for Fake", of 1974, examines tricks and fraud, and focuses mainly on two men who have been exposed as frauds. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the supposedly fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, but, at least, apparently, affirms his innocence. The other main theme of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as real works of the original artists. Among these stories are pieces where Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and also addresses the fact that his career started as a hoax when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio feel with "War." of the Worlds. " <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie and to find it deeply since I am a devotee of Welles, but I did not dare to do it. Part of the problem was that it was not only non-linear, it was completely dispersed. Although I appreciate the elegant editing and the jumps and fast approaches, especially when used in an unusual format like a documentary, there was simply too much information in "F for Fake". They created a distraction unlike the loan style. If the story had been clearer and more complete, I think the edition probably would not have been so annoying. The scattered narrative was made even more unpleasant by the fact that these were really interesting topics, particularly Elmyr de Hory. Its artistic falsehood raises the issue of fraud in the art world, and who is truly capable of determining the authenticity of certain works; And if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in the museums? This is a documentary that I would say at least to try, but do not be afraid to deactivate it if you do not enjoy it. It is undoubtedly the most discombobulated documentary I have seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, none of which is adequately represented or isolated. I do not have a minor opinion of Welles after seeing him, but certainly, in my opinion, he does not stand out as a brilliant specimen in his work. 4/10 - Shelly
