Ah, such an original title for a film of very poor quality. The dubbing is hilarious because the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was happening as I watched this disaster unfold. There are flashbacks inside the flashbacks and there is no real time until the end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I rewound it twice and got the best abdominal workout of all time. The Aztec lady singer is a natural comic and the dances and costumes are hilarious. A guy has a face full of acid, there are a lot of fights, you have no idea who is any character (not that I really care), and it's a big disaster. Oh, and the real fight does not happen for a while, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
