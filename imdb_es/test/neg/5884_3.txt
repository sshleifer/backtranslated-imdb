The title is an inappropriate name: the film shows just one year of the so-called "Marquis de la Divina". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the silent joys of the reign of Terror. <br /> <br /> Historically speaking, the background is quite incomplete: "the party De l'refere supreme", the failed attempt of Robespierre to create a secular religion, its fall, a heavenly opportunity to show the sinister machine of the Doctor Guillotin at work speed). <br /> <br /> As far as Sade is concerned, it's an absolutely mediocre affair: you're waiting in a former convent with other nobles, a golden cage if you compare it with, say, Marie-Antoinette's or the scientific one . The fate of Lavoisier, and he exchanges useless conversations with a young virgin about death, love and other trivialities. There is a mandatory "daring" scene but you have to be patient because it takes a long time before it appears on the screen. And, anyway, by today's standards, can we call it risqu√©? "De Sade" by Cy Enfield, who enjoys one of the lowest ratings of IMDb, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a more credible marquis than the elderly Auteuil. And it had John Huston.
