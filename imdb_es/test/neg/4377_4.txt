Well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a true martial artist and kicks some butts in this movie, but it's quite slow and the acting in my opinion is mostly mediocre, although I think Steve James does a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theater at the end of the movie instead of going after Norris' girlfriend. Until then, the killer had only killed women. Oh, well, I guess it was not as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie that you can transmit.
