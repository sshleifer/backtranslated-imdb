I'm sorry, but I usually love French thrillers, for example. Chabrol - but this was a brilliant shambolic mess. The fact that it was based on a book by Harlan Cohen is revealing, because instead of being a French film (based on psychology and character), it's more like a roller coaster by John Grisham-esquire by numbers with absurd twists of the plot, flashbacks that update the previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned, you think 'hmm, he will be the bad boy!') and mysterious stereotyped character sets that seem to inhabit different movies. In the end, I laughed hysterically at the unevenness of the tone of the film (the scenes in which the main character is being helped by two grim streetwise characters are, unintentionally, hilarious), the completely disconcerting plot, the absurd coincidences and the blows of good fortune (for example, divination the password for an email account) and yawn uncontrollably (I thought I should have read the execution time of 1 hour and 50 minutes wrong since it seemed to last for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
