There is simply no redemptive quality in this movie. Okay, some of the costumes are fine, but they're nothing you can not see, say, in Conan's movies. And what about Ator's hair? I can not believe this is part of a series! I'm going to say one thing about this movie: it was considered bad enough for a riot right by the first cast of MST3K and I suggest anyone who is curious to see how bad this movie is to see that version of the movie in look for moral support if nothing else.
