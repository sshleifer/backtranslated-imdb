this is not a movie. This is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, folded with a random text. The images are not so good and the text is not so good either. The final product is unbearably boring. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, activating the comment can provide some entertainment value, since the director presents a rather strange argument that it is a science fiction movie. It is also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and difficulties that the crew endured to compile this video. Too bad it's garbage. But I think "The Making of Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating movie, something like "Ed Wood".
