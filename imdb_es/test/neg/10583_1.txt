The film begins with a spoof of Spiderman, which is his introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of the fame of "Drake and Josh", personally he would have given the movie to Josh, which is much more fun) and the joke of "Rick Punchers" is They took it out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel to get ideas for this movie. Rick's class is on a science trip to the Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we find the first name of the star in the movie, Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) playing Dr. Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly from which his powers come. <br /> <br /> We find our next big names in Rick's house, his Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days fame) and Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson of Airplane, Police Squad and Fame) of naked weapons). And they present Carlson on the Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons), who is killed quickly. We have been told that Rick has slept for 5 days and receives some cheap scenes, of sexual orientation, designed for the adolescent public to pay attention to. The lookalike scene of Stephen Hawking is painful to watch and it really is a bad idea that does not work and is not remotely fun. <br /> <br /> We get another spoof of Spiderman (Rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end there when Jill was hit in the head by a bowling ball that would have broken her skull and killed to his stone. You can see how Rick's first powers emerge (grip and speed) and then his first rescue, which is very bad. We also receive an incest reference that is in very bad taste. We received a flashback and a parody of Batman in which we discovered that Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks The uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (of Hellboy) playing Hospital Doctor. Then we get a parody of X-men (very bad, since Patrick Stewart is almost as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by another similar. <br /> <br /> We find Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson) looking awesome in her costume!). Ricks' first outing in his suit (once he fixes his ability to see and breathe through it) is another Batman parody. The clip of Tom Cruise Youtube's interview is reproduced by another similar (and not very good at that). There are many modern references such as Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia that show that the film is set at present. There is a very weak gay joke (it is not a good idea to do that either) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille to prepare the Thanksgiving dinner and the pee scene is not very funny, it's just childish. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly fun, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds him funny must have a mental age of around 12 years. She was murdered and then we have a very bad necrophilia joke (is not there a theme that these people do not try to use to laugh?) At her funeral, and the worst joke about cremation. <br /> <br /> At the awards ceremony, we received the 2 worst images of the whole movie (Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela) and, if you still did not know how childish or stupidly ignorant, The film is Landers wins the "Douchebag of the year" award. Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to pass Jill twice in the same direction). <br /> <br /> Obviously The Hourglass is frustrated, Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final.
