This movie is truly pathetic in every conceivable department. horrible, horrible, horrible It only lasts about eighty minutes, but believe me, you will feel like you are watching an Andy Warhol movie (then, again, twenty hours in the life of the state empire, the construction would surely be much more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... the rotten script, the disgusting cinematography, the bad acting, the spectacularly bleak effects, the dreadful music or just the thin weave that resembles a sieve. This movie is incoherent chaos <br /> <br /> A particularly remarkable scene takes place outside a café when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, indicating the waitress watching through the window of the café he comments with an average English accent "Damn." To straighten out that woman. Damn this horrendous monstrosity. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved should be completely ashamed of themselves. Let's hope the director never finds the funding to go back to work.
