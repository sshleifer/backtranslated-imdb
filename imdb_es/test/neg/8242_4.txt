I've always liked the Carry On movies, with their double sexual innuendo and their slapstick comedy moments, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. Basically, many Brits meet in a coach to go on vacation to an island called Elsbels at the Palace Hotel. What they did not know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share the bathrooms with their neighbors, they have raffles, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, with a rather funny accent, for example, the peace that sounds like the bad word P). Starring Sid James as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, seemingly shit (I can not remember who he is). Logan as Bert Conway, June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques as Floella (a ridiculous character, not as memorable as her usual matron), Bernard Bresslaw as Brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs. I admit it's not great, but there are only enough dialogue gags, and of course Babs in the shower, and go to her butt with that iconic whistle, and later a quick boot of her bra. Good!
