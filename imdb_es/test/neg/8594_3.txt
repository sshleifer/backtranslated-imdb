The basic plot is good and can be attractive. The music is so good that it became the musical theme of the IRON CHEF television show (although it is too much used and is too intrusive in the film). So, how did this movie end so poor?!?! Well, the plot was 95% predictable and the characters were as two-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue? What person would really be allowed to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bullet that claims to be a dialogue? You get much more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points, but it is so tarnished by clich√©s and rotten dialogues that it quickly becomes boring. And, this is a shame, because firefighters deserve a better tribute than this disaster! If you do not believe me, look at the amount of nonsense listed in IMDb for this movie: a way in excess of what you expect to find. They just did not care enough to solve all the problems and problems. Then, as a result, the film seems rushed and needs a rewrite and reissue.
