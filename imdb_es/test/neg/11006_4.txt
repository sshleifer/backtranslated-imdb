Director John Madden of Shakespeare in Love fame gives us another pretty bad movie in Ethan Frome. The plot centers around a new reverend who arrives in the city of Starkfield, where he learns the story of the sick wife of Ethan Frome, a crippled man, and a romantic date with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from the novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edith Wharton, this film is not interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and misdirection that turns the scenes that are supposed to be touching into a mix ridiculous Still, there are other aspects apart from the film that work: the cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman contributes with a lovely score, and although no one is at their best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well in their roles But in general, Ethan Frome only has a marginal value and is easily forgotten.
