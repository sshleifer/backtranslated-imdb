Amazing, superficial, without materialistic sense. How can women (and gay men) enjoy this junk is beyond me? No man who respects himself would want to be with one of these neurotic gold prospectors. What is even more disturbing is that many critics say they relate to women in the program. If that is the future of women, Lord, help us all. Showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not try to extend your legs every three seconds with a different man. I think this belittles women and does not do them justice. But this revision is not ranting against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "captivating," but every time I've watched this program I've struggled to stay awake. Despite the narrative of the journalist, at no time in this show is anything like something that can be considered a rational thought. So, it's not entertaining and it's not informative, so why would you bother seeing it? One out of ten stars.
