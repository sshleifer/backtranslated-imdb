Normally I'm not inclined to write reviews about movies that I do not think deserve a mention. But, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I DO NOT like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> The popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual vampire of Anne Rice, first appeared on the 1994 screen in the hit "An interview with a vampire". Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the stylish aesthetics and gothic scene of the film captivated the audience. While it may have been a case of style over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chess (I've never been so enamored with the genre Vampire in general). <br /> <br /> Since then Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone to much bigger things. It is likely that both have laughed to laughter when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final result. "Queen of the Damned" typifies the type of cr * p that Hollywood is willing to publish at low cost in the hope of earning fast money thanks to an average soundtrack and a large marketing campaign aimed at children aged 13 to 17 years. <Br /> <br /> It goes without saying that this movie is terrible from the beginning. Lestat, now played by the British Stuart Townsend of the fame of "Shooting Fish", wakes up from his dark grave to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He scares some confused punkish musicians and joins his band, on the condition that he only appears at night, with the sun burning his skin and all during the day ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Marguerite Moreau ), a student who studies the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101?), tries to find out if Lestat really is who he claims to be. On the way, she falls in love with him (something to do with her strange past), but she has a little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who returns from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen King. <Br /> <br /> The film is embarrassingly self-indulgent, but its bell-like tone leaves room for its depreciating mood. Anyone who watches this movie for something other than a good laugh needs to watch more movies in general! See Townsend is nice. He knows that the role is completely exaggerated and does everything possible to walk the tightrope between absolute hamming and serious acting. The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role. She has a minimal screen time, and what she has does not use it to the fullest. Bad makeup and special effects do not help; Sometimes it sounds as if you are speaking through a voice box. <br /> <br /> It is rumored that this film went straight to the video until the untimely death of Aaliyah last year. With the possibility of people watching their final film, Warner Bros. launched this into a general release. Otherwise, this would have been one of those movies that you see on the shelves of video stores, but avoid them because you can say they will be just terrible. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, movies like this one will continue to be made. Look at the series of rom-com teen scams or the fake of that genre in itself with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market to explode, Hollywood will. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie, then they will chase it. That is business. But what worries me most is that people will go to the movies and pay money to see it. I suppose that is the biggest argument in the world of cinema: do cinema and entertainment come first, or vice versa? The only people who can decide that is the audience. If you like and are interested in good movies, stay away from this turkey.
