A totally pathetic film attempt on sacrifices of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. Total waste of money even if you only see it on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly rental with the DVD, otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money. Probably made by artistic types and full of the symbolism in which the Chardonnay socialists of today seem to be so interested. Frankly, this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave guys who never came back. Somebody, please, provide the funds to make a decent movie at least equal to Saving Private Ryan. Hopefully, the RSL will put as much distance as possible between themselves and this movie. The story must be told from all sides to the Australians, the locals and the Japanese. Although it is very unlikely that the latter will tell the truth about anything that happened during the Second World War. Basically it's garbage, I do not see it, I do not buy it. Walk away
