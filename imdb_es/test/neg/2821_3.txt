I can imagine why I would want to die, after starring in this garbage. The man is incredible, but even Sidney Poitier could not save this tedious moral work on racism in the old West. He and Joanna Going are fantastic in this movie: pity that the script, the co-stars, the direction and the score could not match the two.
