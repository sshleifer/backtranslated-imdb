It's a kinder and gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. Is it the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible film by Jean Claude Van Damme, or is it the end of the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there really was no need for this movie. Why was it necessary? Angelina Jolie. She can play a killer robot that can explode in the middle of intercourse, but, what a way to do it and although this is her first film, she still has the presence that made her the winner of a prize.
