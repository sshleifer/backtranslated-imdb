To be completely frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. Inuyasha certainly is not terrible: he has some good moments, the occasional flash of intelligent humor and, unlike so many moods, dignity. However, it completely lacks the essential elements of a worthwhile story. From the beginning, its premise condemns it to be stereotyped. The main plot focuses on collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as one might suspect, an entirely generic epic fantasy affair. The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting several enemies for pieces of the jewel and, therefore, it is quite predictable, lacks complexity and it is easy to lose interest. But as many spirits have shown, a poor premise can be rescued by a deep, realistic characters. Sadly, nobody recovers Inuyasha's story. Kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical heroine of the anime (and very reminiscent of Akane, the main character in the previous work of the original comic author Ranma 1/2); She is kind to other women, but she treats many men, especially her love interest, with unjust, blatant and unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a tough guy on the outside but sweet on the inside, and Miroku is the unfortunate character of "the pervert." <br /> <br /> The faults continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. Despite the constant action, the story does not progress. Despite the usual romantic moments, neither does the main relationship. Despite sufficient time, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry to the ice cream of mediocrity, all this stagnation extends in approximately 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My final critique of this anime is animation. Although it is certainly not ugly, it shows an almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. The animators seem happy with the long scenes of Inuyasha jumping in the air with whistles of wind in which they do not have much to do but move a background. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the beautiful animations of the world in With the fingertips placed on the keyboard, there is absolutely no reason to look at Inuyasha.
