Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, although disappointing for many, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and I saw it on the bottom that was made by the Broken Lizard group that made Super Troopers, so naturally I picked it up. I just found a scene to laugh out loud, graciously. Very far from Super Troopers. In general, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you have a lot of free time and really need to kill some time. However, it is better to play video games or look at something that can make you laugh or think.
