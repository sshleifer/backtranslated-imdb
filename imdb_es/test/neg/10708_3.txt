This movie is horrible beyond belief. It is a piece of trash without meaning, low budget and poorly written. But on Saturday afternoon I found it on TV, it still comes to mind as one of the most entertaining I've had in front of the television. The evilness of this film is epic, maybe not Ed Wood's epic, but close. The premise is hysterical (men are forbidden because they are too dangerous and are imprisoned in football stadiums), the culture of pseudo-dykes is ridiculously strange (there is a clandestine sex trade with women who dress as men to serve) ") and The "last man" of the title is an unfortunate reincarnation of Rocky's Rocky Horror Picture Show.I could not see the end of it, which I have to assume was so soaked with syrupy "What have we learned from this?" Silly that would trigger an impulse to brush your teeth, but everything in the first two thirds was memorable, even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest, it's still worth it to anyone who gets kicked in. Outside the hood, stupid, without B-flicks brain of science fiction.
