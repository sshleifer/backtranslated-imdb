When the claim to the fame of a movie is that Martin Sheen's younger and lesser-known brother stars, you know it's not going to be really good. "Soultaker" is a stupid and low budget film about a group of young people over 20 years of age persecuted by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it's pretty entertaining, and even somehow a little nice for its stupidity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very small, and has been extended as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not a great actor, so fortunately for the public, he has very few lines and his role mostly walking. This movie really feels like it's trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, considering that it has the same plot design as a slasher. 4 characters, each one dies one at a time ... will one live? Who cares. Although it sounds like I hate this, I did not. I just did not like it very much, but it interested me most, so I guess that counts for something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
