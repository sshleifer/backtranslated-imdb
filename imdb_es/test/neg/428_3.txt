This movie would probably have been good if they had not used CGI (computer generated images) for the werewolf scenes. It made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish. CGI is ideal for certain effects like the dinaours in Jurassic Park or Twister. But when we see a movie in which the creature must appear completely real, CGI is not the way to go. Look at An American Werewolf in London. No CGI. Only makeup and mechanical creature, and what you can think of was more realistic. of what was shown in the sequel. This movie offered some gags that were fun to watch and the humor in this movie appealed to me, but it's just a movie that I thought was fine, and that's not good enough. In my opinion, an American werewolf in Paris is not compatible with the original.
