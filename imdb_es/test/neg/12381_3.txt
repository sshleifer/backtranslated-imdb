Is this as corny as they come? the concept of a massive, indestructible alien bird is already too far-fetched for words, but wait until you have a load of the clumsy creature as it appears on the screen! Do I tell you that I laughed so much with this that I missed some of the expository dialogue? On the other hand, the latter is often so heavy in scientific jargon and the laws of physics and such (in which I've never been so good, despite my love for science fiction movies) that it did not really matter anyway. The bird ?? First represented as a mere blurred form that vibrates through the heavens but then shows itself in all its splendor? It is so sublime that it would not be bad in a Looney Tunes caricature (witness the series of intermittently taken photographs that begin with the creature in the distance and end up in a close-up of his face). <br /> <br /> Director Sears had done much better with his other UFO movie, the fine EARTH VS. THE FLIGHT HALLS (1956) ?? with special effects provided by a teacher, Ray Harryhausen (speaking of which, I just gave away my copy of the latter in anticipation of the acquisition of the recently released Columbia DVD); Also, it seems to me that some of the images that illustrate the uproar of birds in New York here were removed from the destruction of Washington that was seen in that earlier science fiction classic. Once again, the protagonists are played by the regular genre? namely, Jeff Morrow (from THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); As with the commentators mentioned above, these titles are much appreciated and loved by fans. consequently, they are far superior to this unfortunate addition to the cycle of alien animals / monsters that prevailed during the apogee of science fiction and beyond (by the way, other flight threats appeared in THE FLYING SERPENT [1946], which I have not seen , and The ironic update of Larry Cohen in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, THE GIANT CLAW can not even reach a decent climax. which is so hasty as to be "a wash", to quote a jet pilot of the film itself, whose rocket attack on the bird is completely ineffective (that is, before Morrow realizes that it is armored by an invisible barrier and then discovering a way to penetrate it). Ultimately, apart from the intractable (and downright tedious) technical aspects, one has the feeling of "so bad, it's good" to see this: after all, does it only last 74 minutes? And, in any case, the bird is such a silly and unforgettable creation as to put a big smile on your face every time it appears!
