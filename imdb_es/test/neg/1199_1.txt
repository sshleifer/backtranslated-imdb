OK, the idea itself is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not have airplanes 2. Children do not compete with dirt bikes 3. Made the Air Force look like a total of idiots 4. The father of children would not endanger all his career to allow his son to accompany him with joy 5. None would a colonel reserve <br /> <br /> The aftermath, I'm sure they were worse than this gut. The soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid. I'm sorry, but I do not understand why anyone in the world would write directly and produce such incredible garbage. The Iranian Air Force is lucky enough to shoot a couple of pieces for an aging F-14, and this guy does not dispute 1 but 2 F-16s fully loaded and fed. Give me a break.
