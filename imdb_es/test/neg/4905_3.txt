This low-budget film about a writer who goes to work in a London casino has a horrible script, wooden performances and there's not much to recommend. Of course, it will attract experts for whom "mainstream" is a curse, and who automatically add 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologies to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (have you written a book yet, or not?), clichés (relationship problems: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little information on basic concepts as the motivation of the character that requires a voice-over narration only to move the story along. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to keep the audience from falling asleep, it includes a street fight scene that is as realistic as a Julius Caesar production in high school. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a brilliant dialogue is "I'll see your ten and I'll upload you twenty", then SHORT to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
