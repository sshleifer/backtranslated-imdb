Surely one of the most vague shows that have occurred on these coasts and that is saying something. Even many of the main actors did not stay for the duration. The fact that it worked for eight years is a sad accusation for the average intelligence and culture of the Australian viewer. It went round and round in circles, with repetitive gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. Did they really pay the writers of this show? I wonder if someone verified their qualifications. There were tired gags about rural people and second-class farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand comedies in English and the United States that had been before. I think that's what I hate so much, that it seems that nobody involved wanted to make it memorable, original or intelligent, but chose the lowest common denominator every time.
