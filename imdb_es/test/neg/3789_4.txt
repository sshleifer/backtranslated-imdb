This opens with the credits of the company that inform us of this by World International Network. I knew I had seen the credit of this company before, but I could not remember where, but I knew it was at the beginning of a really bad movie that I had seen, so I seriously thought about changing the channel, there was only one thing I had seen in each movie. in the other channels, which is one of the problems of being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell I thought it would not matter if WANTED is good or bad because I can still check it for this site. <br /> <br /> As expected, WANTED was not so good. It is a plot I had seen so many times (too many times) before involving a fugitive in the race, a bit like the television series THE INCREDIBLE HULK without the ripping shirt. Jimmy goes through the mafia in a totally artificial way and runs off and in a totally artificial way is working in a school of Catholic reform. Have you noticed a description used in the last sentence? "Entirely devised" is the answer. Let me repeat how difficult it is to think that this is a totally contrived film where everything is based on coincidence. Another problem I had was the reform of the church-run school: it is too compassionate and kind, it made me believe that this type of establishment makes Alcatraz look like a country club, I say that this is a fact, but when the priest It looks like the image of Donald Rumsfeld that you feel that you feel there is a lot of sugar coating going on. <br /> <br /> To be honest despite the ridiculous twists of the plot, etc. although it is terribly good either. I never really needed to turn it off, no matter how ingenious it became, which is a complement to the movie.
