Fame did something strange. It was not just a musical that was originally created for the screen (the majority is based on Broadway musicals), but it also generated a television series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is not a musical. The musicals have numbers of songs to advance in the plot or to show the feelings of the characters. The song in this music is not used to doing it either; In fact, it has no use for it. People just sing randomly to fit the plot. And that's not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> Fame's so-called plot has an avalanche of characters (which were all presented at the same time, the last time I saw them in a movie [Gosford Park] had disastrous results) who auditions and participates in the New York High School for the Performing Arts. They are all for different reasons, that is. Performance, singing, etc. The drama in quotation marks develops as these middle-aged people who pretend to be teenagers go through their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free university, and they can not let everyone in. So how is it possible that some people who are really bad enter college? Obviously, so that the drama can happen between all these different people. And why is the person not billed in the movie until near the end, for no reason, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations in which these people without talent face, but you can not feel bad for them because you do not know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters realize themselves throughout the film, but you do not realize that, because in the first place you do not know what they were like. <br /> <br /> As for singing, it appears randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. When you sing the title song, you play in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller, everyone is in the middle of the street dancing wildly and without detours. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I would say more, but fortunately most of the movie has gone out of my head. Just do not see it. You will do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> R rating by language.
