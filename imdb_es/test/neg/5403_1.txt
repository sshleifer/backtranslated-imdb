As a useful warning to others, I think "Skeleton Man" is worse than "Raptor Island". I've been using RI as an example of the worst original movie featured on the Sci-Fi channel, but SM is the most ridiculously incoherent and miserable movie I've seen. Yes, I saw almost everything, entering it in about 35 minutes. He attracted me with his sheer ineptitude. What was science fiction thinking? Once Skeleton Man and the leader of the surviving platoon (or whatever it was, I'm not good at the terminology of the military unit) came to the chemical plant, the film moved into an area of ​​impossible nonsense that was almost fascinating . I had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had edited someone to make a terrible whole.
