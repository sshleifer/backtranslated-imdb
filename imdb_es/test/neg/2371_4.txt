Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour take this film, not without problems, since the script was obviously improvised from old episodes. When it came out, this must have been a real disappointment, since it was also done with the budget of a bus ticket. The attempts to get him out of the house, which is incredibly unrecognizable, a bad job everywhere, with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match at the local gym just do not work. Most of these are just character light settings for a solitary gag, not particularly good. That said, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone else with him) is mostly hilarious; they even manage to run a soda siphon gag, but you can see the struggle with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the plot halfway. Don Warrington has very little to do except 'be black', and because of the random script hacks, Christopher Strauli changes character at least twice. And in the end, as I used to do in the television series (although you may not remember it, read the scripts), Eric Chappell disappoints you with a time ending. Were they so cynical, or just too desperate to be in the movie business? Rossiter and de la Tour are always fun, but as a movie, it is a terrible postscript for a television series remembered fondly. D.E.P.
