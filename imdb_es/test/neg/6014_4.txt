If she had not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the obvious choice for the main female role in this tragic account of an affair between a US soldier and an English nurse, set in the context of World War I. His British accent is not perfect, and in the 1950s it was unusual for a great romantic protagonist to be with an actress in her mid-thirties, even one as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older than her protagonist. There were several young and beautiful British actresses in Hollywood at this time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, any of whom could have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had an important attribute that all were missing, namely, a marriage certificate with the name of David O. Selznick. In the event, the film turned out to be such a turkey that, without a doubt, they were grateful to not have it in their CV. <br /> <br /> The film tells, in an extensive way, the story of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer who serves in the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse of the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick is wrongly accused of being a German spy and condemned to death. (The film shows a very harsh picture of Italian military justice, it would seem that the Italian courts of war had the power to issue the death sentence after a trial that lasted thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or speak in his defense). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels have not always been a great success when filmed. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "To Have and Have Not", a film that is considerably better than the book in which it is nominally based, but that is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film in a new version of "Casablanca", set in Martinique instead of French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of "For Whom the Bell Tolls," "Goodbye to Arms" is too long and fatally slow. It is also an error. Jennifer Jones never makes Catherine come alive. As for Rock Hudson, his supposed Christian name could be woefully appropriate. He could be as solid as a rock but also as impassive as one, and in this film his Frederick looks like a personification of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cold. The image has little to do other than some attractive postcard views of Italian and Swiss landscapes. Not surprisingly, it has not been a success and his failure has ended with Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> An error. Shortly before the battle of Caporetto, an Italian official affirms that Russia had already concluded a separate peace with Germany. That battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian revolution did not take place until November; It was only the "October Revolution" for the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed an armistice with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918.
