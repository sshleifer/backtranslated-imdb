I have to say that this is the worst movie I've seen in my life, I can not believe I wasted $ 10 on a blockbuster; This film must be burned and whoever has thought it has problems. Who really spent money to make this movie was crazy = D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes do not make any sense. Well, the whole movie does not make sense. Also the part where those "men" enter the restaurant (department of national values) which turned out to be the worst part of the movie. How dare they say Frank Sinatra's name in vain? Also, what about those glasses? When the boy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can say she is not drinking! Also, what about the freaky dinner guy. And everyone knows that you do not stab the tires, you cut them.
