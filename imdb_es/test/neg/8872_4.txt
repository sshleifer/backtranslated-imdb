Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one that made me think of the expression "wasted talents". I have never seen so many good actors who gave such terrible performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, etc.). The "aged" makeup is quite horrible and, to make it worse, it is very illuminated. The use of music (for example, love at first sight for the young field assistant) is sometimes so caricatural that I could feel most of the spectators around me smiling awkwardly. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a pretty good actor, but seeing this one and "les morsures de l'aube" I think I should start considering resigning. Please, Antoine, leave that project "master of Balantree"; I doubt you deserve it.
