Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this parade of stars of great actors could really warm this movie, but no. Travolta assumes again the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we've seen the mafioso trying to try his luck in the difficult world of creating movies, it's no fun anymore. This is a typical problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first was good, the second will be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second can not be, hey, Hollywood tries to understand the originality, it can not be duplicated, You have to give us a new twist, not just the same movie made again with a bigger budget. I constantly found myself. I almost did not laugh when I was watching this movie, but I still got a lot of great actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock, that's why and only that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
