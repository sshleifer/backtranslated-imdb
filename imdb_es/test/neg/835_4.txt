ANY WEAPON CAN PLAY (2 out of 5 stars) "Spaghetti western" totally routine starring the guy who used to play "Kookie" in "77 Sunset Strip". The plot is complicated nonsense about some stolen gold coins and several armed men of dubious motivation who try to track him down. This is one of those "happy" westerns ... which means many attempts at "comedy" ... and some really heinous music during most of the action sequences (it can be said that it is not the work of Ennio Morricone ). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter named "Stranger" ... but he does not leave much impression ... he simply does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who can do a lot with a poorly written character. The ending is a complete parody / homage to the end of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" ... although it's barely funny enough to be considered a "parody". The highlights of the film are the first 5 minutes ... which present the actors following Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and another person (Is it supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear ... ) that face by Stranger. It's a funny joke for fans of fans of Sergio Leone and fans of spaghetti western ... but I imagine that no one else would understand the point.
