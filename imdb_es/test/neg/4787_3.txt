After I could not ignore the exaggeration about the program, I started watching the first season and it seemed really good and I got hooked ... for about 5 episodes, then it began to spiral downwards. Why? First, Ethan Suplee is assigned a script to act as a complete idiot that confirms it, obviously, throwing semi-random things with great expectations that somehow become the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has an impressive appearance, but if she thinks to stretch her lips to explore parts of her face that they normally never go to and make strange faces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious, she's out of place. Maybe he thought his character would be too flat, he vanished and wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but he made an avalanche of colors, an excess of spices and screams to get attention and that hurts my eyes, ears and intellect. <Br /> <br /> Really, I really wanted to love this show, like I said, the premise is great (it comes from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee is doing a good job here, along with some of the other actors, but there's no way I can not 'suck' and forget that this is just a show, because the extreme characters of Pressly and Suplee surreally wake me up abruptly when they appear. It's worth keeping in mind that your characters and their performance would be fine if this were not a series of 70 parts and if they did not have so much screen time.
