This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled revenge, the movement as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed in 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the dubbing in English was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and that much of the dialogue was repeated. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid listening to Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do). If you're looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch. If you do not want to see a movie full of incest, bad dialogue, scenes of unnecessary fights, torture scenes and confusing twisted scenes, then this is not the movie for you.
