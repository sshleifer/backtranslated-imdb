Recension: Angels & Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He has also made famous movies such as The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace , ??). <br /> <br /> At first I was surprised because they changed the beginning of the big movie. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) into another person, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was good that they could film at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues, they are spectacular car races in Rome. And I also really like the part in the Chirstian Archives when they destroy Galileo's work, it was funny. It was also funny that when they were locked in the archives the second time they entered, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the files and when they were unearthed, the electricity went on. <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid Robert Langdon was not in the helicopter, but the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) gets himself alone, another detail is that in the film the Camerlengo is an adopted son of the Pope. In the book He is the true Son of the Pope. <br /> <br /> When I should give the best acting performance, I should say Pierfrancesco Favino, who plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst performance was the killer, which was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he had a low performance, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie has a low performance because the director Ron Howard played some many stupid changes. I would rate the film for 4/10.
