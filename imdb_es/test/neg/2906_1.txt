This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I have seen such unpleasant things as Hands, Space Mutiny and other things, and I can honestly tell you that they do not have a candle for Science Crazed. <br /> <br /> Science Crazed does not have an indisputable plot. Something about a man who makes a woman pregnant through a turkey shredder, and the child's birth * hours * later is fully developed and ready to kill. Of course, being a newborn, it takes about an hour to kill people. The director constantly records the images and takes about fifteen minutes to set an uncomfortable death. There is about one page of dialogue for the whole movie, however, the dialogue arrives approximately one minute after being spoken. <br /> <br /> Sample scene: the monster is walking down a corridor. We know this because there are about ten minutes of looped images of his feet. Between the loops, two working women treat us. Repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. When the monster appears, nobody moves, and everyone looks like deer in the headlights, since the monster takes another 10 minutes to arrive to kill them. By the level of the performance, you would suppose that the people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know that my description does not seem so bad, but believe me, I can not fully describe the pain that science is. Crazed <br /> <br /> Stay away and boycott all the video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
