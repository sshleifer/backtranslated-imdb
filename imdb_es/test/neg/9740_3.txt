This is a stupid movie. When I saw it in a movie theater, more than half of the audience left before the end of half. I stayed until the bitter end. To show strength? I caught it again on TV and it was much more fun. No way is it a classic, not even constantly fun, but the family grew a bit on me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do and it's free on t.v. You could do worse.
