I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian, but I was still very offended by this movie. The basis of the film is racism, minorities in general (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) They are represented in a narrow way. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and the subjective portrait of the Asians. In addition, critical attention has been paid to Anna's biography. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictional events to her story to project herself in a good way. Some critics of the film and the biography have even stated that Anna invented the whole story. A horrible but good film for the discussion of BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction instead of a work of non-fiction.
