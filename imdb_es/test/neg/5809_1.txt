This film is at the same level as "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" to get the biggest pieces of trash that have hit the silver screen. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended as it should: like the toilet paper of a great film executive. I hate this movie, it makes me want to hurt people. I admit that I have high standards, but I honestly prefer to see Step Up 2. The saddest part was when I logged into IMDb and I read that the garbage pieces gave this film a 6.9 rating. This is a testimony of all the delays in our society that will go to see terrible movies that only last an hour and a half, jokes of pacifiers and grass with little or no originality. After seeing this rating, I would like to suggest "Tyler Perry's Pain House" to everyone who enjoyed this movie; You will see some high quality humor on the same level as this abominable abomination.
