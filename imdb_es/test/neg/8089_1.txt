Here is the spoiler: At the end of the movie, a small piece of you dies. You will spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You will walk through the streets at night looking at the windows of your neighbors while they sit down to dinner. Friends and family will try to identify when he became exactly a living dead person. Respond to your questions and concerns with a blank look and some whispers about a testicle out of control. When AMC inevitably turns Tomcats into the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. You will wake up the next morning huddled on the kitchen floor with a slight taste of brain in the mouth. Then you will be dragged to the living room and the sofa. You will look at the wall, you will get a little wet and then you will start laughing maniacally. Because once you're dead inside, Jake Busey in a thong is really fun.
