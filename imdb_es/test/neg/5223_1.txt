I recently had the idea of ​​making a short film with a man who was hit by a car and woke up thinking that he himself is Chuck Norris. This meant that I would have to do a thorough investigation of Chuck and find out everything he could about the man. Later I discover that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With such a face, who could doubt it? I've seen more Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than anyone should. I'm proud to say that Bells of Innocence is pretty close to the worst list of all time. I spent most of the movie wondering if I could return my copy to the Wal-Mart store without the receipt, which I had been biting to avoid swallowing my tongue. The main reason why I chose to buy this movie was that I not only had Chuck, but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was on the side of the old block of paper bags that nothing can be done. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in film history for one simple reason. The only character he plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, no matter what situation, he is always Chuck Norris. The only thing he has about his son is that he is consistent. Mike does not seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where she talks to the girl about her dead daughter, she seems extremely happy! Maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter into traffic, as shown in one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. Their actions confused me throughout the film, making it very difficult for me to concentrate on the small plot that was there. The other two main actors were as painful to watch as Norris's son. The boy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has appeared on the screen Direct to video. The only thing I remember that was in another movie that was not this, was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes this guy something. The other guy, who is the only name I can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average Christian fan. I have nothing against Christians, in fact, I am one, but this guy was too much for me. To complete the story, you have a crowd of people from the town who love to call people "friends", and a couple of villains who do not seem to be able to decide which of them is in charge. Not to mention the spooky kids that remind me of the dollar store version of all the other groups of creepy kids in the movies. All in all, the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, in more levels than Chuck Norris can kick people's butt. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I still do not get tired of Chuck. Maybe it really was sent from heaven ...
