This is not a terrible movie, simply insipid. The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. Try to be a series of genres and fail in each. Falla as a comedy, as suspense and as a horror movie. It almost succeeds like science fiction. The direction is not inspired and Katie Holmes, the cute cherub face she is, must be modeling a teenager's clothes, not acting. The only thing that prevents this movie from being 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. His performance is fabulously disastrous and worth (almost) suffering for the rest. His ability to transmute from imperious to false sympathetic to manipulate and control diabolically his prey shows a masterful range. Apart from Marissa Coughlin's delightful interpretation of Exorcist, Mirren is the only reason to watch this movie. A solid 3.0.
