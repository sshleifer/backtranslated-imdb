Worst movie of all! It is not smart or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing everything possible with a horrible script. <br /> <br /> Acting was so bad that you can see the dead breathe. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer / director combination believed that Quentin Tarantino or something like that (you know, make a movie about anything that is still great) but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope the writer never makes another movie EVER! Not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please, do not watch this movie, even in silence with the stereo working. A painful 84 minutes.
