Sorry people, but I must say that I really can not understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone has when watching this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to find out how much longer. I had to spend with this Kindergarten nonsense. <br /> <br /> So, why this verdict? <br /> <br /> First of all: the film tells a story that offers no emotion! It's not even the funny, distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of the heads of all the little kids. It has nothing intelligent, nothing inventive and it lasts for hours ... the story has the right content for about 30 minutes. The rest are much improved scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat great image. It does not work Even the cuts seen earlier that Tarantino often uses only confuse and are by no means great. <br /> <br /> Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Ah, really? They? The only Nazis who killed were a handful of men, one of them is man enough to die to betray his comrades. Is this the ugly face that Tarantino wanted to give to the Nazis? A brave soldier who is braver than any of the "Basterds"? Certainly not -> fails And what about the terrible killers of the Nazis? Well, they're all killed by Nazis, except for two who are taken hostage -> wow, what terrible vengeful monsters are ... <br /> <br /> Third: Any character? Yes one! The only role and the only ray of hope for the whole movie is Chritoph Waltz, who is building a truly profound and very detailed character here. Great performance! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely outdone by Waltz. I've never seen such a weak performance by Pitt ... And the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen and you'll never see later. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds, I expected to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": a group of extraordinary children, each with a different character, making their way to their destiny without fear and knowing ... Then I felt very disappointed, when I saw the "Basterds inglourious". There are no details at all, there are no characters, there are no real men, only some random types who will not remember those who were not given any opportunity to differentiate themselves ... But in reality, it is not even necessary to differentiate them, because "except that Pitt does not play any role in this movie ... <br /> <br /> So I was very disappointed, and seeing this movie in the # 40 spot of the best movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth open ...
