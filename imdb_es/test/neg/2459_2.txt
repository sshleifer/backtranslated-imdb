I do not care much about the factors that others here have opposed: acting, lighting, etc. For the most part, these things were executed well enough to carry the film and convey their points. After all, it's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What bothered me were the points themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is deeply sticky. In fact, it is really a fundamentalist Christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the 'sins': <br /> <br /> * The character of Sutherland was made with a child at school when he was a preteen, which led to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * The character of Baldwin was used male tricks, persuasion and good looks to fuck some women, some of which he recorded on video. Ooh, the pigs! What bad luck for him is that women are so passive creatures without gummies that they did not have complicity in the matter. <br /> <br /> * Roberts' character's father returned from Vietnam as a drug addict, so embarrassed to be caught firing that he commits suicide. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why could not he have become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and the Bacon character chosen in another student. Horrible! The fact that he was a child, apparently does not count at all. Children, it seems, are judged divinely according to adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, perhaps many people support this level of moral absolutism. Without a doubt, it seems that it has not been noticed in the comments of this film. Does everyone simply buy these things? At least human laws treat children differently than adults, recognizing that their ethical sense is partially formed. This movie has no such objections, and I find it quite objectionable. The same goes for the notion that women are fluffy and helpless creatures before the bad desires of young men. Or that a Vietnam veteran driven to drug addiction is so embarrassing that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
