As a big fan of Jim Carey, I sat at the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane seemed to have all the raw materials to make this other Carey hit. After the first five minutes of good humor, it seemed that this movie would provide, but it failed as soon as the plot began. The idea that a charming, charismatic and top-notch VIP employee might suddenly find himself working at the nearest supermarket. It's so hard to believe, and then understanding the fact that this guy has also become a criminal criminal is practically impossible. The actors also seem confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, wealthy and carefree boss of the operation does not fight a bit to achieve its one-dimensional character, but for Carey and others around him, the work is much more difficult. One minute, Dick is seen as a cocky office professional, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he's a clumsy man who can barely put two words together, and ultimately becomes a little thief who can, very happily, put him one weapon to another. Jane's head is equally confused with her role and her character never gets going. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so good and it's a shame that this movie has not made it work. You can find the strange moment of laughter out loud, but it's usually more physical humor than witty or witty. Carey does everything possible to save a sinking ship, but her comedic talent can never blossom into a character who has so many holes in her personality. Carey shines when he is presented with a strong and daring character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) that this film never presented him, despite his best efforts.
