I hate guns and I have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or to others nearby and you find a gun, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever causes the pulse to stop and increase in you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a very 'hostel' type movie, but more realistic? how this can really happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, right? 'Shuttle' was a decent movie, although long. Some good downloads (always call AAA even to change a tire), basically just a surprise, but for the most part, you could see things to come. And apart from the typical "tie" instead of what was mentioned above, shoot him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing of a best friend to the other. Overcome those, it's nice for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females who travel alone from their house in Mexico (wow, that's original) and one lost their luggage, which prevents them from leaving the airport until late. And after a sign language scene, previously announced, they enter a half-price trip "too good to be true". The clich√©d athletes, previously presented, made their way onto the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's double of 'Speed'. From here, it is obvious what happens (I mentioned that it was an imitation of 'Hostel') but still, I did not find too horrible, but nothing spectacular. However, I would have served the audience better with about 15-20 minutes eliminated, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and you feel horrified.
