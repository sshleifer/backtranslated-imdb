This movie was produced by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although its authors boast that it is the largest film ever made in Costa Rica and its actors even dare to say that they did not get an Oscar nomination due to their political relevance to oil (he, right). .. Well, all this is a lie. This film was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (a theme similar to a super cliche soap opera) and its secondary history is about an oil problem on the Costa Rican coast of Costa Rica with a US oil company that I wanted to explore the oil deposits in the region, but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now, you can have some pretty pictures about the beaches, but that's it; nothing bigger than that ... everything is in the camera. Most of the actors are terrible, with the exception of two or three. The rest lacks sense of what it means to act: they exaggerate most of the time. The story is completely common and clich√©, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said ... because the crew promoted it as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is not impressive, it's very simple and the dialogues are not very well thought out. It also has some editing problem in a couple of scene changes ... but it's also pretty decent. The director did a good job, that is, he is not like an Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources at hand. I would like to ask you why, instead of using the Costa Rican actor, he spent most of the money on foreigners. I mean, after all, they boasted of being a 100% Costa Rican production ... that's what they at least expect. Finally, the end is not well done, there are flaws and details that do not coincide or are useless. Besides being the most elaborate film in the history of Costa Rica, I think it's mediocre. You can make much more interesting and better images with less cash. I've never heard of "Pi"? Anyway, if you're curious about Costa Rican or Central American films, it's going to work, but you're definitely not missing anything.
