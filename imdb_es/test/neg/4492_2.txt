It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent RV park or perhaps a white boy from 'Compton' LA is witness to a terrible child tragedy related to drugs and violence. Unprofessional but dedicated police officers try to tear down a network of high-end "sophisticated" drug traffickers only to be fired and chewed by the lawyers of the drug lords. The plot is complicated as more people return to seek revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was a walk by Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If you were at a movie theater, I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was horrible and painful to see him. The worst part was the cinematography in which the director blinked again within the same scene so that the sound did not coincide. And NO, it was not a codec or a DVD problem, but an intentional technique. Ughh Two stars
