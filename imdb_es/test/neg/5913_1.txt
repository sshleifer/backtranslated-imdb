This is truly one of the worst movies that have been made, and I do not mean in a bad way as good. Eddie Murphy is a great comedian, and is a testament to how bad this movie is that almost killed his career. The writing and the direction are inept, the stages and the staging are as imaginative as the episode of Brady Bunch, and the performance shows how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with. If it were not for the costumes, which, aside from Eddie Murphy's ego, seem to account for most of the budget, you would swear that this was slapped by a group of high school students wasted in mint Schnapps. That someone can find this parody in some funny or entertaining way is amazing. It is probably not a coincidence that the wrong souls who are praising this stench can hardly read and write. But if your idea of ​​hilarity is that Della Reese blows her "little finger", then, of course, put aside your cup of drool and go rent this movie.
