When I wrote Savage Intruder in the IMDb search engine, one of the options that emerged was Savage Garden: Collection of international videos: The story so far (1999), the only reason why I mention this is because I am a big fan of Savage Garden and you should do yourself a favor and review some of your music as Affirmation or A la Luna y Atr√°s instead of bothering with this average pot boiler, I'm sorry, I just wanted to say that. Anyway, Savage Intruder begins with a strange montage of what appears to be the premiere of the musical and premiere of MGM and some rotating portraits that have no meaning in the long run. In the late 1960s, Hollywood and in the midst of glitz and glamor, a serial killer is working on selecting aged actresses, killing them and dismembering their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) gets off a tourist bus in search of employment when he stops at the house of a now retired actress, Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was "one of the most great in history. " film 'but now lives in a big house with an older housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young maid named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine recently broke her foot and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic the job. Slowly, Vic delves into Katharine's affections and, more importantly, into her large wallet. Vic begins to put Katharine against the other employees, but Vic is not what he seems. Vic is a drug addict who makes Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and spoil Vic's malicious plans, but she has a close encounter with an ax, no one in the house is safe, as Vic brings drugs, sex, rock and roll party and landscaping to the mansion Parker while his sinister plan begins to be more and more apparent ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe I thought that Savage Intruder was a bit messy but a little entertaining at the same time. The script is everywhere and you can not really decide what you want to be, Savage Intruder suffers an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a severed head and limbs, immediately after a mysterious unidentified figure murders another woman (Dorothy Kingston), but then completely discards the elements of the slasher movie that has just been built and that he will never return to them. Then, Savage Intruder becomes a kind of feel-good movie when Vic befriends Katharine and shows her how to enjoy life again and have an implicit sexual relationship with her. Actually, it's disgusting to think that she's big enough to be her grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a recluse and abandons alcohol, as Vic seems to make her happy when they go to the party together and organize banquets for Katharine's friend as she does too. This part of Savage Intruder would not look out of place in a Disney movie! From time to time, the tedium of feeling good is interrupted by Vic shooting and having silly hallucinations about his Mother (Sybelle Guardino) and cutting his hand with an ax, he also has sex with Great at a given moment. Then, after Greta has been killed, Savage Intruder becomes a strange horror movie when Vic is revealed by the madness that is. Savage Intruder simply does not flow properly as a film in my opinion, since it mixes several genres with little success. Similarly, the elements of the murder mystery do not work and are frankly an enigma, why not spare any effort to hide the identity of the murderers during the murder scenes, but then make it very clear who is committing them throughout the murder. rest of the movie? Vic as a character also did not work for me, at one point he is a great, calm, intelligent and clever swindler, and then, he's crazy crazy! Why kill all his other victims but with Katharine try to cheat her? What makes it so different? If it's because you have money, why not go and look for it to start? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the dialogues of the 60s are very funny to listen to these days, like when Vic offers Greta an analgesic, really hard drugs, and Greta says "why do I need an analgesic? ? ", Vic responds kindly" because you are a pain "this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do some gardening and ask "do you have green fingers?" he replies "no, but I am good in the grass!" There's not much blood in Savage Intruder, some limbs cut off and a couple of decapitated heads. There is also a pretty impressive shot when someone cuts his hand with an ax, so it will probably repeat three or four times. Scenes of silly-looking drug hallucinations must be seen to be believed. Technically, Savage Intruder is fine, the location of the filming in the grandiose mansion and the Hollywood Hills will probably give it a better look than it deserves, the performance is average like the rest of the production. In general, I would say that Savage Intruder feels that he is trying to be a murder mystery that, unfortunately, causes the murderer to go away and as a result it simply does not work. At best, it's an entertaining show once and a complete disaster of a movie, you decide which one!
