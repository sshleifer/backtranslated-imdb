This is an excellent conceptual piece and Brando's performance is an excellent work. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is also pretty good. Unfortunately, it's a very disjointed and very long piece that really should have been edited in something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We followed the lives of 3 men from 1938 until the end of the Second World War and watched them discover who they are and what they can become when they discover the world around them and what they are made of. . For some, it is the women in their lives who produce this realization, for others, they are the broadest general circumstances. Too often, however, I found myself wondering what had happened or how important a particular scene was.
