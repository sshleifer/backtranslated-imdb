Film version very resistant but, ultimately, harmless of the literary children's classic that incorporates an animated part in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very distinguished: James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins, but their roles range from the villain (a 69-year-old Mason as a chimney sweep) to the unimportant (Greenwood as a stunned aristocrat) to the strange (Whitelaw plays several "exotic" characters, including a circus artist, an old witch, a maid and a fairy, for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of the film, managed by a group of animators from Eastern Europe, is not inspired, but it is pleasant in itself and, as usual, with this kind of thing, there is a variety of songs that one has to endure, one of which in particular is repeated too often for its own sake. The film was directed by the famous actor Jeffries, who had previously directed (with much more success) other films for children, namely THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972, that I have not seen yet, but that was released some time ago on R2 DVD by Anchor Bay UK).
