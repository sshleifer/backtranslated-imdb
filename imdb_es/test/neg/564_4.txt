Done in a false documentary style, the subversives of the late 1960s and the supposed detractors of the dominant government are arrested and given a choice. When sentencing for their wrong actions, there is an option to go to prison for 7 years or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert in Punishment Park. In the 100 degree heat, prisoners must walk fifty miles on an American flag for their freedom. Law enforcement in the United States and the state will follow two hours later. If they capture dissidents, it means prison. <br /> <br /> It appears in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
