It is difficult for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and avoid throwing objects at the TV screen, in fact, if Jane Austen herself were to see this, it would be something fun and possibly dull. The adaptation of Maggie Wadey turned Northanger Abbey into what satirized, the Gothic novel (and the readers of gothic novels). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is described quite closely to Catherine de Austen, an open work. At heart, generous girl whose imagination simply flees with her. But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a hero of a gothic novel that takes tobacco, that handles with cane and that makes funny tracings: it is a prankster, an almost handsome man with a disordered room and a life (that is correct, Henry Tilney is a cleric, a charm that is completely eliminated from the script). Some of the best scenes in the novel, when Henry, utterly expressionless, mocks Catherine's outrageous, literal-minded, diction, magazines, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not represented in the adaptation. A large part of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes do not adapt. In addition, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate: Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25 years old, dark hair and dark skin, not 35 or 40 and blond. <br /> <br /> There are many other absurdities within the adaptation. that invokes surprise and disgust, who is the marchioness and what is she doing in history? Why is John Thorpe less foolish and more intriguing? Why is the Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with its romantic visions, waits for hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that the Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable and modern house, another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunkard? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only escapes with her in Northanger, with Henry to correct her gently. And finally, why are so many facts related to the Tilney family and the death of Mrs. Tilney unnecessarily modified? To make the story more "horrible"? All these oddities and more are simply too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
