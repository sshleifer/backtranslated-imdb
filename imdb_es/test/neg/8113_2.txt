A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) runs into the city of Gatlin, where children have killed adults and are always eager to kill them more, on the way they are separated and Peter Horton, of course, must save his wife from These tedious things. Terrible guys in this very bad adaptation of one of King's best stories. In the original story, King managed to create tension and draw the personality of his characters, however, all that has been eliminated from production and all that remains is a repetitive boredom that is too predictable to be so suspensive. In addition, the effective ending used in the story is discarded in favor of a happy ending that makes the overall impact mute. There is a bit of atmosphere and an elegant address, but there is no argument to back it up. Children are very unconvincing too. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
