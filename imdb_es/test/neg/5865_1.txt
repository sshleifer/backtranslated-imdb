We sat through this movie thinking why this or that scene in the movie, what does this have to do with the plot? We expected that in the end everything would be a little clearer. It was not so. <br /> <br /> I think the director, in an outburst of pique, threw the script into the air and then a minor (and vengeful) subordinate reassembled it at random, without taking into account the scene that was being filmed . (possibly with scissors and glue). <br /> <br /> The reasons for the film include: Is communism bad? Bad nihilism? Poor upbringing badly? Bad trios? Bad TV? The coherent writing wrong? Good deconstructionism? It really is not clear. <br /> <br /> Finally, no German water taxi would NEVER have a ladder without chains that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The abundant amount of "achtung" signs everywhere is testimony to this fact.
