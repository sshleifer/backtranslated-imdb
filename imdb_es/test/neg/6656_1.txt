I have not seen Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see Kevin Costner's postman. This is worse. Maybe the worst piece of junk I've seen in my life, and if you look at my review for Moulin Rouge? that's saying something The bad plot, the acting was poor and even wasted (although, yes, Michael Keaton has been in some of the worst movies I've seen), and this movie has no redemptive value for anyone with more than half a brain. DO NOT SEE IF YOU HAVE GRADUATED THE 4TH GRADE since this will seem an insult to your intelligence.
