Do I enjoy science fiction as much as the next man? But what the hell was that? Apparently, filmed for only three days with the excess stock of film from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this short by Jean Renoir is a disconcerting futuristic satire, produced on a budget that could not have been much more than zero . In the year 2028, after a great war, Africa became the most civilized region of the Earth, and what was once Europe was called "Terres Inconnues (Unknown Earth)". An African explorer? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man dressed as a black man, if you follow me? He travels to the ruins of Paris on his spherical plane, and lands outside the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and his primate companion, perhaps the most spooky monkey man costume I've ever seen in my life . The savage, as part of a strange ritual of sexual initiation, begins to show the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is happy to learn for himself. <br /> <br /> It does not help the movie that Hessling, which was wonderful The next year in Renoir's "The Little Match Girl (1928)" is not a good dancer, although the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Also, I'm quite surprised that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a flagrant sexual object. It's not a surprise to hear about your divorce just three years later! On the positive side, I liked the general concept of science fiction behind the film and the clever satirical touch of reversing the racial roles that are typical in stories like this. However, the reason why Renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all time. "Charleston Parade (1927)" is a cinematic rarity of one of the most respected film directors and is perhaps an effort he would have liked to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I made a commitment to a selection of pieces by Dmitri Shostakovich.
