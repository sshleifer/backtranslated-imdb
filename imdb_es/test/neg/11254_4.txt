Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when the creators of an Anime do not understand what their fans want. I, as a fan, did not want a 1920 movie, Evil Nazi. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, since we do not really know what happened to her. I would also have liked Ed to go back to his world much earlier and stay there, to finally have the chance to be normal. You know, start a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that kind of thing. No, instead, I got a complicated plot involving Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes of Al, a Roy Mustang cameo joke and just an Armstrong joke, a short joke and Winry did not hit Ed. with a key Above all, it just did not feel like Fullmetal Alchemist to me.
