The film begins with a narration of the protagonist that explains certain crimes that occur throughout the city and then we realize that the hero is a policeman who is suspended or has probably withdrawn. I did not have the patience or interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep voice to induce sleep, it is time to put an end to it. Seriously, I fell asleep and did not bother to close the movie either. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was about and why there were no outdoor footage. A third-category TV series will have more series of games compared to this movie crap, and I still feel sorry for the actors and producers involved in this great nonsense of a movie. It should have been produced as a normal television series or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it on the big screen. A total waste of time and money. It was assumed that the film would be in production for a long time and it would have been better to leave it like that. With dialogues and redundant series that induce sleep, this is the worst movie I've seen.
