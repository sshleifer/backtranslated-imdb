This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This film makes Friday the 13th look like a Best Picture nominee. The acting is shit. The special effects are garbage. Nobody dies for about 40 minutes and all that people do is act badly. The only thing that saves him is his ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity that is happening. The most fun part is to see the heroine "fight" against the attacker. She is supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old girl. Nonsense scenes happen in people who do not die and no scenes in people who do die to the point where they do not even know why they are dying. I love slashers but this is crap.
