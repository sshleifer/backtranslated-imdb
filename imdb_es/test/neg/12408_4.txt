How do I feel after watching the Wong Kar-wai movie in 1994 Ashes of Time? More specifically, did the reissue and reissue of 2008 with the word "Redux" at the end of the title? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie just did not work at all. I wonder why the movie did not get important points in my book. In particular, what was the movie that dragged her and made it the worst movie of his career in the director? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not too hard to decipher. Let me say that it is really a pity that Kar-wai has rushed so abruptly into the hell of mediocrity and poverty in the movies, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released Chungking Express, one of his enduring legacies and a Absolutely sublime movie. So ?? What went wrong? It would be convenient to consider Ashes of Time as an experimental film. Our director essentially puts his own inimitable style of shooting and puts it in a completely different environment, atmosphere and atmosphere; What results is a catastrophic movie that is everywhere and simply does not work. Therefore, it would be even wiser to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Bold, bold and innovative, but a failure, nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born film author who has left his mark on the world of art houses since his debut in the late 80s, will know that there is a primordial aesthetic that unites to all of their movies together; Essentially and frankly speaking, all are colorful, evocative of thought, kind, subtly humorous and with significant evocations of life, love and loss. The same formula is transposed to Ashes of Time; however, the regular configuration of Hong Kong is riddled with, and instead, we are located in the environment of ancient China, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clan members. <br /> <br /> Intertwined in this Quasi-adventure / historical caper is the typical love story of Kar-wai, this time with an elegiac killer who has moved to the middle of the desert and is carrying out assassinations for contract. However, I must stop there; The description of the characters is useless. Why? Because it is not worth mentioning a single character in Ashes of Time or nothing. What an insipid distribution and what a waste of talent (the Ashes of Time case contains almost all the usual collaborators of Kar-wai). <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the film is essentially endless, incessant and confused in a horrendous narrative structure, almost non-existent. One of the main reasons why the detractors of the Ashes of Time reprimand it is because it seems to have no plot, not to mention an appearance or an indication of one. You can definitely see what they mean, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the movie. Perhaps it is the atypical atmosphere of ancient China, which is neither used nor appropriate to the typical style of Kar-wai filmmaking. I like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that Mr. Kar-wai has taken care of the business here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a critic can really congratulate on Ashes of Time, even if it is a compliment. isolated, is another director's mark ?? Wonderful aesthetic, colorful and happy. What a cheerful color is composed on the screen, what glorious textures are painted for us and what impressive landscapes and images are captured for us throughout the film. At least we can take this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still present in the background, and it is only the film that is so atypical, and buries its generally commendable nuance. Although the images are not enough to completely absolve Kar-wai from this disastrous company, are they enough to make the film worthwhile? and at least we do not leave the film in a total and total state of mind, now that there is something we can think about very well. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film, which continues in the style of the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing differentiates the Kar-wai film from the best of Kurosawa, and that is that in the films of the Japanese director everything merges and simply works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound Wuxia movie, let alone an intellectual and provocative film in general terms, is a futile effort. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that making Ashes of Time exhausted him, and that needed time to clear his head. It must have been a tiring effort on his behalf, since his efforts are incorporated into the film and transferred to us directly. I mean, just watching the movie is a tiring effort, and now I need time to clear my head of this unpleasant experience of going to the movies.
