Lucille Ball was a powerful power on television during the 50s and 60s, but she still made an occasional movie, most notably THE LONG, LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE. Although her career in television continued to be strong, when the 1970s began, her film career seemed to be declining, but Ball was determined to have one last big-screen adventure, and the project she selected was the musical MAME, 1966. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the paper seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a crazy and uninhibited woman who " inherits "his orphaned nephew Patrick, and takes him to a wild Tour of the possibilities of life, bouncing from one comic wave to another. The music, which included songs like "Open a New Window" and "If I Walked Into My Life Today," was among the best works of Jerry Herman. The supporting cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; The night of fanfare was tremendous; The movie was a disaster. The critics were horrified and the audience was speechless. <br /> <br /> No matter what Lucy's fans say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it's hard to know where to start. It is misdirected, badly filmed, poorly executed, and there Lucille Ball is at the center of everything, unable to dance, unable to sing, and smiling like a wax doll while an incredibly bad choreography revolves around her. But the disaster is not of her alone; The distribution rates do not improve. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their roles on the stage of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the first is scenic, the second is depressing. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is quite alone and, evidently, he is not very happy with it. <br /> <br /> The DVD takes the film from the VHS panning and panning version, but that only means there is more horror to watch. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; Although I would not say that it is bad enough to make you want to take your eyes off, maybe you wish you had. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
