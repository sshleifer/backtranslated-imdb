Some modern horror films of Janapese are very good. A strong plot, moments of fear, good acting, while others are just ... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the last field. <br /> <br /> I will rate the film based on 3 elements: argument, fear factor and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Argument: faithful to the name of the film, the plot moves in a circle and never explains itself. OK, the city is captivated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so foolishly? There is a fleeting attempt to explain what is happening for the reporter ... without luck ... <br /> <br /> 2) Fear factor: if it was intended to be a horror movie, it has failed miserably. I really can not remember a good scary scene with a lot of accumulation. <br /> <br /> 3) Acting - very monotonous. People walking, saying meaningless phases. I really can not feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> In general, there are much better modern Japanese horror films with a coherent plot and strong characterization. Do not bother to waste your time with this applicant.
