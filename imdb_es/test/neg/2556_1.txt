Like the previous commentator in this movie, I also found myself crying at times during this movie. Sometimes, one wonders how a movie with such an awesome horror comes into being. From the first moment our protagonist wakes up in his New York apartment from a dream of subway trains interspersed with galloping horses (what the Irish immigrant has not had), it is clear that we are in trouble. And there is nothing better. <br /> <br /> Returned to Ireland in the 1950s, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the subject of the Irish Civil War. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the Civil War. The drinkers in the pub are divided according to their loyalties to the Civil War. Memories are made for those who died in the Civil War. The city is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... the Civil War. Every look and conversation is loaded with a meaning that goes back to the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The propaganda of Broken Harvest's VCR suggests that the film is a parable of the problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel that catches my attention is that, at present, the conversation in Dublin is dominated by one issue: housing prices. If your intention is to offer some kind of information about Ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. It is striking how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its legacies. However, a film with much more subtlety and intelligence will be needed to tell us about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event in the psyche of the nation. <br /> <br /> For those American viewers who have suggested The film evokes the atmosphere of 1950's Ireland: it's not like that. Ireland, in the 1950s, was a horrible hole, ravaged by poverty, sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in droves. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
