I do not agree to call this movie stoner simply because weed also makes an appearance. I can not imagine that this is even close to "stoner classic". That would be like calling Singles a "grunge movie". The film definitely stomps along with a murky plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script had fallen and shuffled or if they had completely lost it and just tried to do it. Watching this movie reminded me to see the children play the children and make the story as they go. <br /> <br /> The characters are made of wood, the dialogue is engraved and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend suffers an overdose? Complete the lack of emotion and the total disconnection from reality. <br /> <br /> As for the drastic guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like looking at the opening menu screen where the same track infinitely traverses the background, without advancing or receding. <br /> <br /> I kept watching and hoping that the plot somehow fell into order, the performance and dialogue would improve or something, I would somehow focus this mess on a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, it never happened.
