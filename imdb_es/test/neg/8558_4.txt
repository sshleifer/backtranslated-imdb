LORD PROTECTOR is children's food, but for whom are the children? Obviously, filmed for TV or STV, this KRULL amateur reappearance has several value characters: a magician, a murderer, a warrior, a scientist, looking for something or otherwise to defeat the Dark Forces that are about to be unleashed on your planet. Written, acted and organized in places available in California, such as municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend, even as a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five-year-olds, probably do not remember him from the old Disney fare as NOT QUITE HUMAN. A nameless actor who plays a magician with a silver wig that does not fit, at least he plays with his tongue firmly placed on the cheek, while those around him act as if they were at a KING LEAR theater dinner. I expected at least a decent action or a sequence of special effects. Unfortunately, the action sequences are pathetically organized and the few special effects are those old cartoon jokes painted on what we used to see in the fantasy films of the 50s and 60s, like THE MAGIC SWORD by Bert Gordon. The filmmakers planned a sequel that fortunately never came to be. Often, such cheap Hollywood productions use a combination of legitimate and pornographic actors. I kept busy during the interminable time of execution of the film, trying to find out which one was which one in this one. I did not have much luck
