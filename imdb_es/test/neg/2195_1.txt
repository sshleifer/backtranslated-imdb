When, oh, when will Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I can not believe that people really consider this movie a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could survive that kind of annoying scrolling interface. It can look good on a movie screen, but if you really tried to use it for a period of time, it would go crazy. <br /> <br /> As for "tracking" people the way they did, it simply can not be done that way. . The security of the network alone would prevent that from happening. The key press record was easy to say. <br /> <br /> Regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed in a production system until it has been installed. Tested, tested again and tested again in a sandbag system. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the "virus". There is no way for a virus running on an operating system to work on any other system. And as for a virus that could get a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that only begs the belief. There is no way for an open remote connection to have the required superuser access that allows the removal of files from the system. <br /> <br /> I could continue but they can not bother me. <br /> <br /> A porn has a plot better thought than this pile of garbage.
