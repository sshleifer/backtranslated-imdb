I saw this movie without knowing much about it. The split-screen device was immediately irritating, and things did not improve for me after the title sequence was over. The plot, the characters and the dialogue were extremely clich√©: the poor of the abusive family is expelled from their home, wants to leave their 'lot', reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses with the clothes of others , is adopted by a gay man who proceeds to dislike on his way to become part of an international group of British drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Patricia Highsmith's estate (the talented Mr. Ripley) should sue the creators of this movie. The triple screen for me, along with the duration of more than 120 minutes, emphasizes the almost non-existent edition. I can not decide which image works and is the most powerful, why it does not show three and I hope it does well with one of them. This trick eliminated any connection or interest you had with any of the characters. An important dialogue was repeated 3 times on each screen, as if to say "this is an important / moving / profound moment, ok!". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
