... "Flight of the Living Dead" has production values ​​that belie the director's poor script "I'm a producer, can not I say it?" Thomas and two hacks that will remain nameless because I feel sorry for having to attach those non-names to this turkey. Apparently filmed on film, this direct DVD release has almost nothing you have not seen or heard hundreds of times. <br /> <br /> Despite the presence of a number of recognizable actors. Like Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari, and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry, and a lot of other not-so-recognizable ones, "FoLD" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most of which ends Soaked in fake blood unconvincing. There are a few (precious) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie stuck in their seat come to mind), but most scripts are stupid for pedestrians and comics, and I'm here to assure you that talking about pedestrians and stupid people. You can never believe for a second that "FoLD" is anything other than a cheap movie with pretensions to being cool. God does not want you to produce the continuation of your idiotic promises. <br /> <br /> See strictly for free, depending on how impeccable your local library is, and otherwise, suitable for insomniacs and only for the indiscriminate.
