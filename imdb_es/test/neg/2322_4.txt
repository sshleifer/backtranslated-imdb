I'm not really a fan of Abbott & Costello (although I enjoy "Who's On First") and, to be honest, there was not much in this movie that inspired me to keep watching his work. It was not really bad. I had some slightly funny scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, given the reputation of the duo and the esteem in which they usually have, I have to say that I expected more. According to the story, the couple stumbles into a babysitting job, and during the reading of Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the boy reading Costello), Jack de Costello falls asleep and dreams about the story. There is a kind of "Wizard of Oz" in the story, in the sense that the characters in the dream are all equivalents of Jack's real-life acquaintances, and the film opens in black and white and changes color during the sequence of the dream. The fight scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the fun parts of the movie. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions in the film: what happened to her? Jack and his gang apparently left it in the giant's castle! I know, it was just a dream, so who cares. However - I was wondering. There were also a couple of nice songs and dance routines. My 4 year old son laughed a little during this, so she could appreciate some of the humor. I discovered that he was an acceptable master of time, but certainly nothing that convinced him of Abbott and Costello as comedic geniuses. 4/10
