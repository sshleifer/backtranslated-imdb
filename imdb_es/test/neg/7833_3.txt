A quick summary: almost non-existent, badly chosen musical soundtrack, stable camera filming made without the fixed coffee but with a lot of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, NO argument, and nothing really happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounding empty, never reaches depth, never creates the illusion that you are really inside a web of conspiracy, and that everyone has a relationship with everyone is simply a boring excuse to show The main actress in nice lingerie. (which, combined with his rusty voice is certainly nice, but nothing to base a movie on) The climax for me is the opening scene, and the film degraded from there to a point where I just wanted to leave the movie about 45 minutes into the story. I regret having left it out.
