Horrible acting with the worst special f / x I've witnessed as well. It's bad enough that I wasted $ 3 to see this pile of disastrous garbage, but it's the hour and a half that I lost that I could have been doing something else like getting a root canal or volunteering for the jury. Getting drunk could not even help this video. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe that I actually lost some IQ points during the course of seeing this idiotic piece of "work" hallucinating. Maybe I should have followed my own advice this time. Never expect a decent movie if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and NEVER expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
