As an independent filmmaker, I try to at least make a decent movie. This piece of ____ went beyond the low budget. It was filmed on video and not 24P mini-DV at least. The appearance of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in Los Angeles and he was talking about that book, Film-making for dummies that he was putting together. I thought that this little video was going to be something but I guess I was wrong. He could have increased the value a little by shooting a 16mm film instead of that horrible video. The plot was stupid, as was the acting and the whole fake green screen and sound and the full nine yards. Tonight I had the option to rent a movie and I made the wrong decision. Dammit!!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a great movie. Maybe the director should read real movie books about making movies and not try to cut corners when it comes to making a low budget movie. Maybe I should learn from the teachers they did, The Night of the Living Dead and The Massacre of The Evil Dead and Chain of Saws. Just to name some of the great low budget successes of all time. This is a video that should have died. I can not call it a movie because it did not use the movie.
