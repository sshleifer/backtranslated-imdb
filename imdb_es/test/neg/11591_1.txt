Komodo vs. Cobra begins when 'One Planet' environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the South Pacific, at first Stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base, but soon changes its mind when a quantity of cash is offered. Together with television news journalist Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they set sail for the island and, once on land, discovered that the military has been funding illegal DNA genetic experiments that have resulted in huge Komodo Dragon's and King Cobra's they have eaten almost all other living beings There & Stoddard & co are next on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by the ever-horrible Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym Jay Andrews, this is just awful, it's just hard to sit through & it's even worse than the usual crap "Characteristics of the creatures", the Sci-Fi Channel has the courage to vent if possible. The script is terrible, predictable and absolutely boring, some giant monsters of some kind are created by scientists who mess with the DNA, a group of people is trapped with these monsters and has to try to avoid being eaten. That's it, that's the whole plot of Komodo vs. Cobra, maybe this was an AVP scam attempt: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title, but all the 'vs.' bit is equivalent to a waste of thirty seconds between the two beasts headlines at the end, boring as hell and surely a big disappointment for anyone wishing to have a complete mix of monsters. The characters are poor, the dialogue is horrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and full of clichés, and the whole movie just sucks with a lazy script that wrongly states that both the Komodo Dragons and the Cobras are amphibians, and they are not. Demons, Komodo vs. Cobra is not even worth looking at because of the involuntary laughter, as it is so boring and almost nothing ever happens, although the image of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach of Cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to receive management jobs? He is probably the worst director working today. How can you keep getting fun sound movies in beautiful places with decent half-casts and still produce such a horrible movie? I think this was cut to get a PG or for his TV show, since every time someone swears he's masked by a parrot's screech! There is no gore or violence, and the scenes of monsters are loose, people just stand there, the monsters just stay there whistling or roaring and that's it. The effects of the CGI computer are terrible, this is really something poor that looks horrible. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of around $ 450,000 this seems as cheap as it was, the locations of Hawaii are nice to see but that's about that Komodo vs. Cobra is a "Creature of the creature characteristic" of the science fiction channel of Jim Wynorski. Movies do not get worse than this. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is absolutely terrible.
