This movie was a disaster. There was nothing really in his favor. The only character that was attractive was the Maya of Bobbie Phillips and it was not even worth it. <br /> <br /> The plot is standard, double crossing of the double crossing. With too many double crosses to make sense. Sometimes that means "it keeps you guessing", in this case "it makes you wait". In the end he just wanted everyone to be thrown into jail or shot.
