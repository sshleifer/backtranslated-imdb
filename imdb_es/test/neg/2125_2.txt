One of my favorite directors of all time has done the most lousy of all the tyrannical ones of Jaws. Lamberto Bava (here under his pseudonym John Old Jr.). You know how cheap imitations of Europe go, right? They just want their monstrous animal to be bigger, sicker and more threatening, but this most often results in the opposite effect. The creature of Bava is a huge sea demon and is more than a shark! It seems we are dealing with a prehistoric monster here, with the jaws and appetite of a Great White, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It depends on a pair of dolphin-loving oceanologists to discover how this monster could survive all these thousands of years and why exactly now it only began its slaughter. The script for "Monster Shark" has little or no meaning and most of the action takes place on the continent. The shark itself is a creation of involuntary laughter and it was a wise decision of Lamberto Bava to show it vaguely and quickly. Acting performances are above average and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well managed. The twists in the plot are predictable and you're likely to have more fun having detailed information about the characters. For example: count all the beer cans that Dr. Hogan takes throughout the entire film!
