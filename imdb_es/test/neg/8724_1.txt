This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the mini series. It has, with some exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that condemned that film and will follow it to the grave in the graveyard of turkeys. Both are adaptations of books with an infinite number of pages that a scriptwriter and a director have turned into a complete disaster (in this case they are the same person) who clearly do not know what they are doing, having both an aspiring messiah who it really does not fulfill, like a hero (played in this case by a guy who looks like Mark Hamill but, unfortunately, the force is not with him) and a group of stupid bad guys who like to betray and ruin life on one for the other, both contain scenes stolen from better productions and both are cheap productions that try to look expensive with some computer animations (often poorly made). The exceptions that actually make this all worse are the terrible work done by the kind of lighting that does not even have the skills to turn on the light in their own living room, the camera work that, for no reason, is sometimes inclined. The "Battlefield of the Earth" mode, but for most of the time it is flat like a pancake, the extremely cheap and small desert that only contains a pile of sand in front of a desert painted background, which it becomes very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea of ​​the costume designer is to try to imitate the fashion madness of "The Fifth Element" with the addition of the dumbest hats ever created. Silly moments to remember: 1. All the scenes with the guild boys, who look like the observing boys of MST3K but with silly hats. 2. Irulan appears at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why the butterflies? Was she the one that had stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) With a matching silly hat, along with a couple of guys with silly hats balloons 3. Pablo the standing comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen acted in an exaggerated manner, shouting "I am alive". 5. Each scene with the backdrop, because it is newer for the foreground 6. All scenes with the false religious cermonies of Fremen, especially the "water of life" cermony. 7. The battle scenes where the same boys die a couple of times and the same things explode again and again. It is much more, but it has a limit of 1000 words, so it is better that I stop before letting myself go.
