I had the misfortune to see this last night on the BBC, I suppose I could have been the only spectator. From the beginning, the movie had something bad, after a few minutes of visualization, I managed to find out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way, like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie, just the old bad quality. <br /> <br /> Why did this become a movie? I have seen some episodes of the television series and I thought it was fine, but I only saw repetitions of that because they did this. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the story was. and in the end I was not the wisest. It seems that at some point I remember a character, maybe Farina mentions that the modulation squad can reach places where normal police can not. The 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the most difficult places to enter, maybe it was student night. I lost track of the plot at this time or maybe there was no plot and the movie was only cut from several leftovers from other TV series versions. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I do not remember any laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, this film lacked the real scene of stealing the power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him, Ribisi would have had someone to bounce with.
