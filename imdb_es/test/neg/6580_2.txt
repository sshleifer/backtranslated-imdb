I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. A character is totally annoyed with a voice that gives me the feeling of nails on a blackboard. There is a totally unnecessary train / roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem terrifying to the small children for whom this movie was made. The scenes of the North Pole with Santa and the elves could have been beautiful and charming. There was absolutely no heat or charm for these scenes or characters. In general, it does not work to make a short book for children in a movie. This movie totally subtracts from my nerves.
