I can not stress it enough, * DO NOT * get this movie for the kids. <br /> <br /> For that matter, it's better to avoid adults too. <br /> <br /> Alright, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit. This is not the worst movie for children ... no, let me rephrase that. This is not the worst movie made by disillusioned adults FOR disillusioned adults and somehow marketed for children (that would be "Jack", which I wanted to review as a kind of fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything surprising (well, if necessary, let's advance until just before the end credits for an Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenomenon). Normally we do not end up making adults what we wanted to do as children, since reality tends to hinder. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I detour). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the hell the kids could get out of this movie. . Most likely, it will only bother them (we can observe the moment when Russ suffered a trauma at the age of eight). There is a better movie, the "Kiki Delivery Service", which essentially has the same message but manages to pity it instead of piercing it in the head. And adults will like it too! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in the movie made thinking of the MST3K-amates, if you think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad boy. in that.
