This movie is a load of garbage. It is quite disturbing to see that anyone can say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Bad acting, bad action scenes that become really funny at the end. Excuse me if this was a comedy, then I did not understand it. If I regret laughing at the scenes of the tent! Do yourself a favor, go to bed instead of watching this! Goodnight!
