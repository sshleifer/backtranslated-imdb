This movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining the radar and it takes a while before you see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50s, this dated piece is a bit slow and the reward at the end is not very good. Although it has its moments like when the boy of Perry Mason argues with an older man and when he says "I have reduced the possibilities to one", excuse me, but when he reduces something, he has a couple of possibilities or more, not one. . If you reduce it to one, you have not reduced it, but in fact you have found out what it is. The monster is the standard science fiction fair of the 50s, better than the grasshoppers at the beginning of the end. The acting is unsatisfactory and the heroine is the most unpleasant ... in fact, in some shots, he looks like a guy who crawls. You see a lot of combat aircraft footage and other things, but you will not see much of the deadly mantis at all.
