I'm not sure where to start. From beginning to end, bad, smelly, like entering a port of John on a day of 100 degrees. If you force yourself to see this as I did, have some Vicodin on hand for the pain. I will never understand how bad movies make the cutting room go by without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The film is a cross between Gumby and Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I have seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob. You will get more entertainment when you see Gone with the Wind while suffering from vomiting and pooping. Bad acting and hokey lines will make you squirm and wish you had rented the great Peewee Top or you've seen all the episodes of Gilligan's Island back to back. UGH ... I'm going to cut my wrist now.
