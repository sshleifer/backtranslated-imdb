Seriously? I mean wow ... alone, wow. I think I saw this movie in an old War Journal issue. This is pathetic, the originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea, what we receive is a new version of an old plot and to "change it" we simply change the gender or race of the original character. fools and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but I guess this is just a tirade and will probably fall on deaf ears to absorb the sound of another mob hitting the toilet water like the best western from 3:10 a.m. Yuma ... (wait) ... 3:10 to Yuma! Thank you Hollywood for killing the film as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrage of neo-pop junk and flagrant retardation ... wonderful!
