The beginning of the film was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I found in my instant netflix queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips together again from Bully. Unfortunately "interesting" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does what he wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the guys (Renfro) of the "crowd" and eventually starts dating them. And, of course, like all other movies, things are good (or so you suppose, since the movie never hints that things are good) and then things do not get so good with rich kids. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead and lifeless movie that after you've seen it, you feel like you could have done something better. Some scenes (those of Renfro's parents) do not even make sense to be in the film because the director and the writer did not follow him at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that I COULD have played was completely ignored and this is almost like watching an episode before they were stars (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from OC). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this movie, and the reason why it does not get a ONE rating is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her in it. Renfro seems to have brought a bit of his character from Bully. And, for Pete's sake, the title is BS, change the name.
