I really do not know why, but I saw it well in advance. Unfortunately, it was out of place. First of all, this is not horror, it is not scary and (unless it was even worse than I thought, what is possible) do not try. It's a bad quality comedy and the fact that I smile once means I gave it a 2, not a 1. This Gremlins movie in a really special way, I can not say I've seen a movie that is dedicated more. Very, very bad - avoid.
