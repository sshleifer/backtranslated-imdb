Ocean's Twelve: simply stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> A theft of art. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and a very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie that I only saw for at least 20 minutes. Do not get me wrong, you may like it. But I only like Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 is not about Heist, what's the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first. Congratulations on that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. Apart from his hit "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing else happened to this director's career. The fault is with him. But only his fault.
