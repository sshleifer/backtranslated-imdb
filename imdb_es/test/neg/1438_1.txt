Wow ... This movie really sucks ... 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The story: a psychopathic Internet predator lurks and attracts young men and women to tortuous traps ... It's like this, people are kidnapped, they find him, he becomes a changed man and is released in the world once again, he goes back to his old ways and starts the torture again ... The story is stupid, it is implausible. The characters are stupid, implausible ... Or at least very above. It has some very violent images, and if you have a stomach for a week you may just want to stay away ... But, once again, even if you do not have a week's stomach, you'll want to stay away ... It's stupid. <br /> <br /> The cast: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage ... If you're a fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, you can find this interesting, as he is the writer and star of this movie. His performance is ridiculously bad, and it can be said that he is the one who wrote the script for God. Kevin Gage ... Well, they say he's been in many other movies I've seen, but I do not remember any of them ... And you will not remember this ... These two sadly, make the movie ... No they are very funny to you ... They just make it ... <br /> <br /> Scale one to five: 1 It's bad ... It's very, very bad. .. In fact it's so bad, that this movie should come with a clip loading gun to play Russian Rullet with ...
