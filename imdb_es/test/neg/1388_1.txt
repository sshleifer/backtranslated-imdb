... If you have been laughing too much for a long time and need to take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this program, I decided to turn it on and review it. out by myself. Everything that each of these people has said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half-hour version of Mad TV, but with somewhat worse jokes. <br /> <br /> A sketch that I had the displeasure to see was "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics". What's funny about the black guy who has trouble swimming or the gay guy called "Sparkles" who wins a banana-eating contest? None of these concepts is particularly novel, insightful or funny. Do we really need a joke about every episode of Star Wars? That movie came out 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to fun things is to mix some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw some "fighters"; and call it a day to go home to roll in your pile of money. Pure genius of comedy. <br /> <br /> Then, he swindled Jeff Foxworthy shamelessly in a second show I saw, with a fragment of "Tu gay si ...". You could imagine the roaring laugh he received when he told him a joke by Ryan-Seacrest-is-gay. It is not that neither of them has already been killed. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of the films of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer, stay away from this program. Especially when there are real comedians like Dave Chappelle who can joke about races and racism and remain insightful.
