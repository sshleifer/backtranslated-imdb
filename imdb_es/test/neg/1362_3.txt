This film is full of pseudo-deep reflections and is cloying in its writing, which includes a voice-over of canned ham and an incredible dialogue. The dialogue is tiny and the tone is dull in the way that Spike sometimes (not always) is when he writes "certain" characters. For those who like mindless movies like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> That said, this comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling who has shown his incredible skills in The Believer. A film that proves that movies are the medium of a director, and when a movie is rotten, it is fair to say that the fault is there and not in the actors.
