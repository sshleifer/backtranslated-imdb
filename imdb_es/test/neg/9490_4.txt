Daft fans are not that different, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that makes everything right. Except in this case, it is not like that. Based on a sanctification novel by the Lloyd C Douglas shrine, (he wrote "The Robe"), and filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it has more value than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but is later directly responsible for the accident in which he loses his sight. To make peace, he takes medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, he's not that stupid, he had planned to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy.) Between them, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> As much as I can, I can not find the redeemer of social commentary and the critique of American customs that are supposed to be just below the surface of Sirk's films, (this one is not too deep) . On the positive side, Rock Hudson is not that bad (I think I'm rediscovering it) and, of course, it looks very good (in Sirk's films people live in cathedral-sized rooms). Nothing in this film coincides with the best of his later work, and even in terms of telenovela, it is definitely daytime television.
