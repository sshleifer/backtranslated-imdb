Every once in a while I come across a movie that is so shamefully bad that I wonder why there are movies. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody the Godfather with annoying cartoony sounds and a bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is simply upset when Tony, an annoying imbecile who at the request of his father, Don (William Hickey), takes over the family business. Tony, like I said, he's an annoying little asshole. This makes the whole movie a complete disaster. The movie is terribly unpleasant. It is too caricatural. The main point I am trying to make is that you can not make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much caricature. It does not work that way. Believe it or not, you have to take the parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you do not take it seriously, it will feel like a parody. What happens with making a parody is that you can not seem too much like you're doing a parody. You have to make it look like you're taking the movie at least a little seriously. It also feels like they're making fun of Woody Allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.
