No Holds Barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten years old was the best movie on this side of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But when you grow up and you see it you feel ashamed of having been as naive as if you would have liked it. You feel cheated, ashamed and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you he is gay, give him a score of five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday.
