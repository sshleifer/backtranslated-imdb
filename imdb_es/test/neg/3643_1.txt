This is the worst show in the history of Nickelodeon. First, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat-screen TVs and gives each student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The plots are useless, and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad that I want to take my life. I really hate the fact that on the show, Zoey is the most popular girl in school, the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has any real problems, and all men want to go out with her. She is so perfect. There is nobody like that. Also, I hate everyone doing anything for her, and everyone chooses her for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so detestable. His experiments are pathetic, meaningless and false. Chase is so weak. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. What a pathetic one. Michael tries to be funny, but never achieves anything. Nichole is so cheerful, and screams a lot. She is never seen doing any work or studying, but she is a heterosexual student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks (Excuse my language). Do I need to say more? I think not. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.
