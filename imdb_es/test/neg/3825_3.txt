This film was the first of the 70s in the film genre of women in prison. This movie was incredibly violent, with many sadistic tortures inflicted on the inmates. The movie takes place in the Philippines, which looks like a horribly ugly country. Undoubtedly, the producers took advantage of this factor to their advantage, to emphasize the horrible situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> The queen of the Blaxploitation film, Pam Grier, has the leading role in this film. She plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into the prison of vile women, on false charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, tries to rescue Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's imprisonment was orchestrated by the corrupt Filipino government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig, stand out among the otherwise dull cast. The film itself places too much emphasis on the violence perpetrated against the prisoners. His captors only used them as objects of his sadism. This got bored very fast. This movie could have used more interesting plot lines and subtlety. This is not one of the best images of Roger Corman. The many films of women in prison that followed this were much better overall. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, just for Pam Grier fans.
