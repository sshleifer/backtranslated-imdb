A group of speleologists with a sad story takes an author to a 'hairy' adventure through an unexplored cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to take advantage of any winning combination of film components, The Cavern has only a relatively different turn in the previous eight films in recent years, and that turn seems to have been taken from an X- File. I like to give each movie the benefit of the doubt, but here there were too many annoyances. The work of the camera can cause a headache, as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. Not being a caver, I really do not care if the filming was realistic. There is totally unnecessary PANNICK on the part of the supposedly experienced cavers, in the last half, are you saying one of two things out loud? Oh, just shut up and concentrate on saving yourself, or I hope everyone dies at the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this movie. A moderate amount of blood and nothing special in the dialogue or the characters. While you're pretty sure you know what's happening at the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the film if they had left the last minute on the floor of the cutting room. It just was not necessary. I suggest you do an ejection immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and you save the settings for the sequel. For a long time I thought that the film industry should share the modified shopping scheme of the restaurant industry. You pay for the materials to make the film before entering, but the benefits of the film come from the advice you give when leaving the cinema. I can not blame what I do not like about this movie because of its low budget.
