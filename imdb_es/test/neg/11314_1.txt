Leslie Nielsen gets to the bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst conventional movie I've ever seen. There's nothing I like about this movie, since it's essentially a joke movie, and the joke is not that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool of himself? That's not funny, that's unfortunate. Nielsen seriously needs to start rejecting some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong must continue to make Jackie Chan movies, because there is nothing worse than this.
