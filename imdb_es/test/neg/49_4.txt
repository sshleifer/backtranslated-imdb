Frightmare begins with the icon of a horror movie that kills a director and then his servant before he rests. This icon, which has some qualities of Christopher Lee for him, continues to persecute those around him when a group of students of the horror film society steal the body of the mausoleum in which it is located. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and a lot of potential for murderous chaos. But the film creeps in the middle (though fortunately not as much as "The House of Death") and never really regains that initial momentum of energy. <br /> <br /> Many of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to make people fall in fear when they see a floating coffin or other strange things. Twice we see that poisonous gas is being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, it's that fake advertising, unless you've spent your career playing bored old men who take a nap and see "Matlock." <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film is decent: the children of horror society steal a corpse. dead icon A modern equivalent (unearthing Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would be a great movie. Maybe a new version is in order if that would not be disrespectful. Sometimes, the theory does not appear as well in the application, and this movie offers that example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw it and I thought "that's Jeffrey Combs" but I felt like I was wrong since the box never mentioned it. But, indeed, Combs was present. (A note for the filmmakers of this movie: mention Combs on the DVD cover, you will sell more copies if you are cheating the customers). If you are a fan of Jeffrey Combs, check out this initial role. Otherwise, I can not offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Allow me to suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn", since both are pretty decent and will stand the test of time.
