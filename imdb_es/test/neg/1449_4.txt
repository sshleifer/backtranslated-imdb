I did not expect much from this movie, but I was eager to try something that I initially thought would be primarily a teenage horror of the early 80's. Although three teenagers are a somewhat critical plot, it is by no means a teenage horror movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Power' is about a small Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be an adult and therefore, 'corrupted') becomes the recipient to unleash all the evil of the idol and, often, with deadly implications not only for the victims of the possessor, but also for the possessor. After making several exchanges to control the control of this thing, three teenagers end up discovering it and can not discover what it is, except that since they found it, there are strange and dangerous things going on. They offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who does not accept the spiritual bologna. Although it is his producer who wants to investigate more, especially if that means he can control the idol (I guess the teenagers are not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). It is a story that is told a thousand times, especially in the sixties and sixties of horror and science fiction. <br /> <br /> This was, at least for me, able to maintain some interest. Although low budget, it did not become as cheap or loaded with bad performance as many of the low budget horror foods of previous decades did (today, they have the same cheesy qualities, but bigger budgets). We have enough left over to allow us at least the opportunity to absorb at least a little the mysterious atmosphere and so forth, despite a history of clich√©s. And, while it's not terribly bloody, the special effects were done very well. <br /> <br /> Again, it is a routine horror tale, especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that is used excessively), but One that is not so shamefully bad. It may be worth taking a look, if only for laughs.
