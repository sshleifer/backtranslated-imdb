I could not even ... I mean ... look ... well ... <br /> <br /> Wow. <br /> <br /> Not even a group of my drunken friends who try to make fun of the movie could have a bit of fun in the least. <br /> <br /> I can only think ... how. How do independent filmmakers from around the world go by without being noticed (or even their lives) and the scammers as the guy who made them get a DVD on a shelf? Seriously, it seems that a guy with a home theater camera came out with some guys he met at Subway and did the worst he could think of. <br /> <br /> "Hello, give me some ideas, start with a field of corn and work backwards". "Well, you have to have actors out of high school, and some broken cornstalks with pieces of clothing tied up and boobs." Thank you, friend, I'm sure that you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side in your next eagerly awaited project.
