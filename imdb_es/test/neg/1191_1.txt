I'm right to think that I went to see the same movie as everyone else ... this movie was terrible. I am a fan of the 3 series of the Gentleman's League and I have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in series 3. This film, however, was a half-hearted effort, the plot was extremely poor having The characters Getting into the real world made this movie look more like the last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie that they laughed lightly, but the rest of the time I was looking forward to it. This would have been better as a 10 minute short on the DVD ... it was more than an explanation of what they planned to do, and it seemed that some of the writers did not agree with the fate of the characters and made a joke about it . kill him in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a true gentleman league fan of the ability to stay cool, then you will hate this movie. If you only see it because there was nothing better on television, then you will love it. <br /> <br /> someone backed me up !!
