The filmmakers forgot to connect the dots, that is, the sequence of events and elections that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and, finally, to 9/11. The filmmakers, of course, refuse to tell us the background story: why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? But that omission pales in comparison to his failure to reveal that support to Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in the name of the ultimately rabid anti-Communism. it strengthened the hand of the anti-Western forces and was a great factor that contributed to the disorder in which we find ourselves today (September 11, terrorist networks, a prolonged land war in Afghanistan, etc.). Because these consequences are not explained, the film leaves the viewer sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey, see his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West. as a whole.
