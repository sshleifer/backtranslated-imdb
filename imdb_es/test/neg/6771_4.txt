I know we should not expect much from a low-budget independent film. But the idea behind this is solid: an attempt to open the eyes of the United States to the comfortable relationship between the government and the journalists who are supposed to be attentive to it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it, away from his drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not as convincing to make a documentary about it. Those kind of convincing protests belong to the era of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Maybe a slow buildup where the young journalist's eyes will gradually open to conspiracy.
