Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever you call it, is in one word: VILE! I saw this in MST and I laughed not only because of the great commentary of the race, but also because of the inept creation of the film that was demonstrated. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get a delta wing? Then they raise some shots from another movie, Where Dare Eagles Dare as pointed out by Tom Servo. To show how cheap this movie really is, look at the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight against invisible swordsmen. Or even better, look for the giant hose dressed like a snake that Ator must fight! And what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?
