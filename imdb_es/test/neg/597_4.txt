I gave this film a four-star rating for several reasons. First, I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that. Still, it's my fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something like a spiritual battle, someone who opened some kind of limit that allowed the demons to enter our world and so on. Something that interests me a lot, indeed. This movie almost hits the target. It was more like on the edge of the lens, more in the tree than in the objective itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this film is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorists to be victims of experiments However, because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to close the gap between the physical and the spiritual realm, the men of the couples can now feel, smell, hear and see the got damn. of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently, the sense of taste is not present in that kingdom. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clich√©. They took the title seriously, since the men, although chained to the beds, demand that the women look back because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good effort for what it was, I think special effects could have been made much better. The demon that scratched the woman was, in a word, hilarious. The wife was hateful as hell and everyone in the room practically rejoiced when she died. However, we all expected the other woman with the chair to hit her. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I do not want to comment on, other than that I think Christian filmmakers should have done it. I found a better way for that. <br /> <br /> And so I give it four stars because it's not the movie's fault. I am not a Christian and I do not like this kind of message, and I loved it. to make comments along. My friend and I watching this movie we looked like an episode of MST3K.
