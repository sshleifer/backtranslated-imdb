The film starts relatively well and seems to be arriving somewhere when an African-American passenger suing an airline for negligence. There is a scene in which your pet dog is absorbed by the engine and that is really sad. But the way it is presented makes it difficult for one to find out whether it was an attempt at raw humor or a tragedy to really reflect on the degree of negligence? After this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you stayed long enough, you will soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. Basically it is a highly racist sequence of smoker drug, toilet humor, style of each segment of the plane to reflect African-American pop culture and almost nothing else. One would think that the only 3 white passengers on board would lead to some funny consequences, but nothing of the same happens. Basically, they were added to show how bad they could be treated initially and then be accepted into the hood if they behaved. Avoid.
