As Jennifer Denuccio used to say in Square Pegs, "Take me to the door." I would definitely rate this movie on the list of worst IMDB movies. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a boy from Chicago who goes to California selling his brother's jazz records. It is supposed to be a barney located in the surfing community just for locals. But he acts more like he's new to civilization (he's just trying to get through his sexual scene without writhing). There are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. The Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to make TT act like a normal human being, the hateful drunken surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another one for whom he can live in car. Sixth month. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big disaster. It begins as a typical game of the seventies, complete with bad music from the 70s (although this movie came out a year before the 80s). And Dennis Christopher appears as the most irritable loser, makes the movie difficult to see (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even if this movie was supposed to be about surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost total trash. The people in the surfing contest seem to be unable to avoid falling asleep. <br /> <br /> I guess the only good thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of her role as Midge in the comedy "That's a show from the 70s". "And Cassell was not bad, he was just in a bad movie.
