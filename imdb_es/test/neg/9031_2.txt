"Escape from Hell" is not made with enough art to disguise what it is: a gross exploitation. The direction and the writing are neglected: for example, the camera work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely distinguish what is happening; Also, if the doctor, alcoholic but kind, had not killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after his escape. that. I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an incredibly beautiful face and body), but a particularly nasty scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points. Of course, some patients will take that as a recommendation. After all, one thing even more disturbing than this movie is that some people really gave it positive reviews.
