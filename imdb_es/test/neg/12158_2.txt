I saw this movie a few nights ago and it was horrible! <br /> <br /> Very long, although they managed to spend most of their lives! <br /> <br /> Very boring: the parts that were included were long and, for some reason, the director chose to get away from part of the action and left large parts of the film without explanation! <br /> <br /> Incredibly inaccurate: the 'mystical' side of this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked Ghengis Khan was not exactly a good guy. <br /> <br /> Acting terribly, I found several of the characters difficult to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked depth! <br /> <br /> One salvation of the film was cinematography. That's why I gave this movie a 2-star rating instead of the minimum! However, if you want to see something nice, I recommend you buy a photo. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was a terrible waste of my time and money! Please, do yourself a favor and do not miss this Mongolian turkey!
