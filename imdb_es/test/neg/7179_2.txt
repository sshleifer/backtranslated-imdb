This is undoubtedly the worst movie in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor Carl Hamilton did. Peter Stormare can not do it, with his psychotic appearance and without style. It can be good to make psychotic killers and maniacs like in "Fargo" or "8 mm", but in this type of roles, it is simply useless. <br /> <br /> The presence of Lena Olin did not work for this film. She could not prevent it from being what it is: an Americanized copy. of big-budget action movies like "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", etc. This movie has nothing Swedish but actors. It is clear that some Norwegian directors of recent creation with McTiernan as a model director have done so. <br /> <br /> The presence of Mark Hamill is only laughable. 2 out of 10
