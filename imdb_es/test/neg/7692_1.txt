This revival of the film is going well in a bad film industry and in Saudi Arabia. I want to know how the director could stand in front of the people of the industry after making this film, the work was very bad, we do not know how the cinema works. Saudi companies such as Rutana and others do not support yang filmmakers in KSA like the United Arab Emirates. We hope that the film industry in Saudi Arabia will prosper in the future. But without that intervention, the merchants and idiots make us bad movies do not benefit the reputation of the cinema in Saudi Arabia. It is like the Roman and Iranian cinema At the same time, please the creators of simple experimental cinema in Saudi Arabia, like Abdullah alayaf, and others to achieve the dream of a good film industry: participate in festivals around the world, far from the Main companies, stupid interventions.
