Let me tell you something ... this movie overcomes all the laughter of Troma and gore movies unintentionally, since in fact it tries to leave like a serious movie. Since the terrible performance ... "I knew it, I knew I was possessed!" ... until the priest accepts sexual favors and showers with naked teenagers ... this piece of manure takes the cake. I'm at a loss trying to compare this with another equally bad movie. This can only be in a class of its own. The good news is that, supposedly, some cardinals supervised the production to make sure that it was true to the real situation. I did not know that the people of Backwoods USA acted like an absolute imbecile. I'm not sure I'm upset about renting it or if I've run into a jewel of comedy. This was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I looked with my hands over my eyes half the time (while I was not laughing so much that I cried). The ending simply did not make any sense, putting everything together perfectly. If you want to see something so horrible that fun, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism ... go ahead.
