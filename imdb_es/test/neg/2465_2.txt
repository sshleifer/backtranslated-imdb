too predictable for spoilers, but I will not be cautious then, so do not read it if you care. <br /> <br /> some bored screenwriters together by mid-afternoon, and still they run out of ideas. so let's start with a wanted criminal throughout France ... no matter what he has done, we'll think about it later (they will not). Some seconds of suspense, but not too much, and nothing unexpected, because that requires Art. It takes half an hour to finish the movie; I understand: have a jeweler stolen and take a long time to avoid alarms, etc .; Everyone steals jewelers in movies like this, it's meant to work (it does not). there's no humor, no character (well, yves montand gets to go crazy a little) and makes everyone speak quietly and quietly that is supposed to make you think of noir, but that simply makes the actors look depressed. if they are silent, it will make them look more somber, but they will also save us from writing their lines. We'd better add something for the women who stay at home and see these things, so let's have something that makes them feel empathy with their husband (we forgot to include any woman in the movie). I have it: a son with marijuana (panting) marijuana. Oh, and make him try to kill himself for no particular reason (what a shame - his father is a mafia boss to shout out loud, but the audience will sense his paternal care, and if not, he drives them away). oh, the crooked cop was a classmate of the type who catches him in the end; heartbreaking, huh? let's all die at the end, or we'll never finish this. Is it in the can? Well, that's over then, thank God. Who are we going to reach for the director?
