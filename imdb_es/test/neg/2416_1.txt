There are good and bad films, bad and bad movies and pleasantly bad movies ... this is not one of them. This is a movie that does not realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it at a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "Grindhouse Cinema". This theater is put on every month. Hopefully the presenters Eric Caiden & co. He will think twice before letting writer / director Lawrenece Foldes come back to them. What a con man The boy got up to talk before the movie; one would think it was Orson Welles talking about "Touch of Evil" or some other lost classic. Barely. Pleasant on their part to take the time of the public with their incoherent inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish" but if you're expecting something like imitations like "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator" you'll be in a sad disappointment The script does not make sense. The direction is so poor that the actors seemed embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the film is to see a car explode? <br /> <br /> Poor Richard "Narrow" Roundtree. In this film he plays another character with the name of "John", but that is the only similarity that his character here has with the classic mentioned above. I hope this movie has allowed you to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who looked like they wished they could be anywhere else include Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time. Even the audience did not like that (except for the only dazzling boy sitting in the back who shouted "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend who laughed with the fervor of a lobbyist who talked to Barbie every time she opened the door. mouth). <br /> <br /> For real movies about vigilantes, I would suggest the following: <br /> <br /> Death Wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Guardian Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No- Mercy Man (the last two are a couple of films presented in this theater a couple of years ago, probably with the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
