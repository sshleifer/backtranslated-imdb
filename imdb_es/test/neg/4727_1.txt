Oh, how I laughed during those first scenes. This silly little film about an 11-year-old boy carrying a gun, stealing cars, stealing shops, stealing houses, extracting money from other children, burning houses, shooting rats, buying drugs, distributing drugs to his mother and friends, and Then kill a boy. What a great comedy! But it was not meant to be a comedy. It was thought as a social drama. How can this be? The events in this movie are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes of the immature imagination induced by a comic strip of a 4-year-old boy. The dialogue is laughable; People talk like idiots. It is a very silly movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are very funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the involuntary hilarity of the idiotic premise ends after a short time, and after that the laughter is rare; for that moment, the spectator can not believe what he is seeing and, alternatively, he is amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half of a brain cell). <br /> <br /> A short film, but it feels like an eternity. Actually, the film is a serious attempt to show the world of a young degenerate, while imitating films far superior to him, such as "Fun". There is such an air of falsehood in everything; Children, adults, all lack credibility both in their actions and in dialogue. The boy in the lead makes his way through the film as if he had seen all of Jimmy Cagney's films at least a hundred times. And, in general, the child is not represented as a reservoir of evil, but as a little artistic talent misunderstood. But of course. All young hooligan are misunderstood, society made it bad. Poor boy. <br /> <br /> The film is shameful; a collection of rancid cliches, sometimes hilarious, that come together to make a film that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the movie is zero.
