I guess in 1997 Hollywood was not about to openly celebrate homosexuality, so you might want to give some credit to those who put together this movie for showing a little courage. You just want to be credited for having put together a really good movie, and in my opinion, "In & Out" does not qualify for that. It's the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English teacher from a small town high school who, on the eve of his wedding, is discovered by an alumnus who wins an Oscar and then has to go through what that can only be described as a period of self-discovery when it comes to an agreement with being homosexual. For me, that was the first problem with this movie. Howard did not have to be gay. The movie would have been more fun (and perhaps even more provocative) if Brackett had remained defiant, despite the stereotypically homosexual aspects of his life and the belief of the city after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes could have been rather insulting to the gay community, as well as to heterosexual men who like poetry and believe in dressing well). <br /> <br /> Kline was decent enough on the paper, and largely took the film. Apart from him, most of the other cast members (although they were good actors) were people who did not stand out for their success on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. In fact, I thought that the most fun (though very small) role in the movie was that of the super model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her so stereotyped model line "I promised to do that session of photos this afternoon, I have to bathe and vomit! ") In the end, what really discouraged me from this movie was the ridiculous ending, which started with the graduation ceremony (and, to be honest, even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary, the movie should have ended there, instead of continuing with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end.) <br /> <br /> Basically, this got me some giggles, but nothing more. 3/10
