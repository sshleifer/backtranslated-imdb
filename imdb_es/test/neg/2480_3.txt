I've seen all the episodes, and the characters have stayed the same, absorbed, little thoughtful scoundrels, no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not a development if you're still the same girl, only now Delinda complains to Danny because dad is not around) Sam never changes or grows, which makes it boring, repetitive and so annoying, it's disgusting after season 3, Danny is a typical soft character that everyone orders in his life (he does not have directors his own morals) especially Mary and Delinda. The old boring clich√©, with which they will stay inside and outside the relationship, will become boring very fast. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is fine to see, just that it's just another hacker hack, a wet dream, an ex-CIA man who has huge contacts and training, etc., can stop any thief or cheat known by him, although the cameras can not do half of the things they do is fun for a while, however, in 5 years the writers act very silly. why? Because they have all this expensive and advanced technology, but there is no simple walkie talkie (communication is quick and easy) you never see security walking on the floor, only when there is a situation, and suddenly they are all there. <br /> <br /> The plots quickly go from cheating and stealing from the casino in one way or another, to the terrible ships of typical American girl relationships, the same material of death that is seen all over the world, They have sex, but I hate you. "I've always loved you, I think so, but I want him / her instead, but what if, maybe one day, blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend" Hotel Babylon "to people who Like Las Vegas, it has much more in its favor simply because the characters are interesting and do not force us to lose our heads for 6 months of the year. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be British. same actors in 5 different shows instead of 5 years constantly getting worse in it.
