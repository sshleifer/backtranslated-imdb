The movie "The Cave" has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. There was no argument, no history, and the lighting was terrible. During most of the movie, I could not understand the scenario, as it was highlighted with flashlights. The persistent "gray" spaces throughout the film were annoying. The only scene that really came out clearly was in the cavern illuminated by what seemed to be a bad simulation of the conditions found in hell. In general, it was not worth watching the movie. If the producers can not find something better than this, they should find another occupation. The scenes under the water were particularly horrible, since they were formed mainly by bubbles and lanterns, with the occasional look of the actors. In short, a really horrible movie with bad lighting, strange flashes everywhere.
