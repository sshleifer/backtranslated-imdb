God, I've never felt so insulted in my whole life with this shit. There are so many ways to describe this piece of junk, that I think if I said everything that came to mind, this site would prohibit me. <br /> <br /> How do I start? Well, to begin with, you do not need to know the original series to know that this movie is a slap for the people who have seen it. The biggest carnage of a subject that has ever been made is here, from a metal version to a RAP version, what were you thinking? How do Underdog and a heavy electronic musical style combine? The story is so basic, that I will do something that I do not normally do and I will not even give a summary. Just think this: a dog gets superpowers, completes the rest. That's how predictable this movie is. And then the jokes come ... please, kill me now. This style of humor that may not even make children laugh is so bad, well, wait for that line of punch after sneezing. That was a little fun. <br /> <br /> But what surprises me the most is why Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are here. In the programs / movies that I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job and, excluding Lee, are the best actors in this movie, but that says very little. The rest deserve Golden Rasberry nominations for this shit. I am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster. <br /> <br /> In general, this is as bad as Doogal, which I also checked, and once again, my head would explode if I saw it. Nothing worse than this.
