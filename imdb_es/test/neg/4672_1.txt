I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" movies with bad dialogue and wood acting. So, I've been tearing up my brain to find one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can not It would be difficult to build a piece of cr * p larger than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use that term lightly) of a team of "Super-Drillers" flying to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares? It's an action film. I'm not ruining the premise. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a couple of scenes designed to present the threat and the characters. Bruce Willis is the team's toughest leader and spends his first screen time chasing Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgivable act of sleeping with his daughter. For some reason, that did not make me laugh. It was forced, like everything in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is called because they are the only people in the world that can drill the asteroid. Okay, I'm willing to accept that premise if it brings us to action, the supposed flesh of the movie. More humorous attempts, with each character going out to do crazy before taking off. Again, I take it. Finally, they are removed. This is where the movie really fired me. They reach the rock and go to work. You would believe it, nothing works well and everything has a countdown of suspense! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one ... Oh, surprise surprise, we saved the day again! <br /> <br /> And do not even make me start with the work of the camera. When I saw him in the theater I thought he was going to be sick. I can only assume that they tried to cover the gigantic holes left by the insipid performances by cutting off a different shot every few seconds (and this from someone who was raised on MTV: Mr. fell short of attention). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it could not get worse ... wait, there's an end made with tearjerker that was added so it made the rest of the movie become a virtual Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Summary: The mills were not ingenious. The plot ... well, I said I would let it go. The performance was bad. Very bad. Even Billy Bob could not rise above the script, which was worse. Camerawork - again, wrong. (I did not even mention the most stupid love scene in the history of motion pictures: think of animal crackers). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half a point for the times I could see the lovely Liv Tyler and try to ignore her acting as an actress) This is the worst movie I've seen in the cinema. .. forever.
