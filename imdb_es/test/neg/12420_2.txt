Basically, this is your violent career for motorcyclists, complete with ingenious slangs, shocks and music. OK, so just slangs and crashes. It is slightly above the other rate that appears in MST3K, but it is still the equivalent of sticking a nail into the kneecap: slow and painful. Giving away the plot would drain my energy, so I'll just say it's better to skip this one.
