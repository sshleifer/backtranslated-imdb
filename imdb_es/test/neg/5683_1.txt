I had never heard of Neil Johnson, the "author" of zero budget, before watching "Battlespace" on DVD in Hollywood Video. Within a few minutes of the movie, I realize that this is not a bad thing. Like many sci-fi movies directly on video, this is a film dominated in large part by misused special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that do not create a story. <br /> <br /> Spectators are tortured with a text introduction of religious sound, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration of the main character's daughter. For me, this looked like a smoke screen to mask a movie with visually ugly elements and no emphasis on the characters. Some people here seem to be very ready to take this movie seriously and swallow it. It seems that the messages of the new era hook and sink. These favorable reviews should come from the same type of people who can be fooled and think that things like "Battlefield Earth" was a brilliant movie, or that Shasta is as good as Coca. <br /> <br /> Those who were attracted to the cheese cover, the art can expect a bad action (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people who do not speak), rotten computer animation effects (in doses extra large) and irritating talking computers. What you will not get is emotion, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogues or a good story. <br /> <br /> The "battle space" is an impenetrable bull and the constant irritation of the narration proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real cinema, is about the characters and their dialogue, not about special effects and boring predictions. This is right there, with a direct similar to science fiction like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022." If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you are looking for, of course, look at the shit about this. If you enjoy a good narration and hate the flashes of false lenses, you'll be better off with a real movie.
