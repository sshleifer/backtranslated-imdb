Jason Connery is not an actor; He is the son of an actor. His Macbeth is the worst I've seen in my life. Oh yes, it kills King Duncan, but it also kills William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please give me the Polanski version on DVD so you can forget this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, there you have ACTORS!
