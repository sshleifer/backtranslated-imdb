Above all, you should not take this movie seriously. It is taken seriously, unfortunately, but that can not be avoided. This ninja anime movie has to be the crowning achievement of spoiling what could have been an endearing story, if not original, with twists in the plot, ridiculous scenes that kill time and a scandalous appearance of guests that will make you laugh or moan, like me). <br /> <br /> While I am a ninja / samurai anime fan (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin, to name a few), this has to be the exception. For the record, from a technical point of view of his time, this film was very well animated and constructed. It's just the plot that sucked. The authors of this film decided clearly (so I do not know why rationally) that they could somehow compensate for the lack of a script if the character of half the world looking for a treasure that (he learns) fought his father and died for. In the process, he saves a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, befriends a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members he knew had in the strangest places and circumstances (and who all subsequently die at some point in the film). <br /> <br /> Even so far, these absurd twists of the plot can be justified, but then come the two "guest appearances". # 1: After having a ridiculously cliched confrontation with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain." At this point, you are probably saying "Â¡encuentro!" This "encounter" serves a purpose: it discredits by I completed a film that tries to add an educated historical background.I thought it was disappointing that the authors took all the trouble to investigate the United States of the 1860s and failed to realize that the real name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it used to belong to Captain Kidd.Now I can hear the moans of disgust. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the scenes in execution.These scenes show various characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for several minutes, and there are many of them.It is these scenes that make this film, 2 hours and 12 minutes, last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a subtitled movie that he just asks to be funny, that's all. Feel free to make fun of all possible aspects and have fun. Just do not take it seriously. 3/10
