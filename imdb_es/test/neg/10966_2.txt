The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: place it in the Old West. Except that it's not the true Old West, of course. It is a kind of Future West, in a world where some apocalypse, as the apocalypse is known to have done, has killed people and later turned them into zombies. It's time for the zombie virus again, folks, and you know what that means? Let yourself be bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> Then, in this dusty and dead world, a hero arrives. He is a bounty hunter, who gets paid to take care of the zombies. It is not exactly clear who provides the funds, but it seems that a small home-based zombie hunting industry has emerged. But, as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They are running out of zombies. The only way to keep winning is to infect new cities and towns with the virus. <br /> <br /> I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately, it takes much more than a good idea and a crowd of people who touch the windows to make a good zombie movie. What we really get is a clone of Clint Eastwood (even the actor named Clint, for shouting out loud) and his "hilarious" partner, who tries to catch zombies while chasing some bad guys who still live to get a great reward. All the secondary plot about the infection of other cities is only mentioned in passing, in the middle of the movie. Instead, there are a lot of cliches from Western movies, bad zombie makeup and some bad first-class performances. Very bad. The guy who would not even get to Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain suck the cigars, the jokes are launched and the people are bitten. As the film comes to a conclusion, the only question worth wondering is whether it will end up with the cliché of the hero being the only living man, having killed the one he loves, or having his cliché turned into a zombie in the end. picture. (It's the first, by the way) This movie was written and directed by Gerald Nott. It is the only thing he has done and, hopefully, it will be the last. At the beginning of the film there is a legend that says "Nott Entertainment". At least they have one thing right.
