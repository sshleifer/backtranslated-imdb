The worst sequel I've seen. Really horrible songs that are annoying considering how fantastic the history and history of the first movies are! Also, what ruins the film for me is the fact that there is no John Cleese, so Jean Bob could not even be in it and the new villains are terrible. It's really annoying that that kind of old lady thing can not properly join a simple sentence without repeating her words over and over and over again. But to be fair, Uberta does not shut up is a bit funny. but the fact was that he turned 50 years old: why do they draw it with an appearance of 80 years? I was going to give him a 1, but now I think ... I could give him a 2. But still the story is not as good as the first movie. It is similar without the humor of certain characters. In general, I did not like this movie completely because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of voices: the fact of having changed the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, the new villains, the disappointing story, the annoying habits of some characters and the very simple animation.
