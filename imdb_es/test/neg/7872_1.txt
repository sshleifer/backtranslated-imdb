I rented this movie when my girlfriend was out, hoping to see some serious military / specialist action. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of watching this "movie", I was so terrified, horrified and sick of the quality of everything. In this movie, I was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flamethrower. Luckily I could not find one. I have seen many bad movies. But this is not even bad, it's total garbage and it does not even deserve to be told like a movie here in IMDB. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the people who have been involved in the creation of this total disgrace. I hope that I will win some Oscars though: D.
