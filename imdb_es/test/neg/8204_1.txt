That distinction has to go to EL DUNGEON DE HARROW. At least Ed Wood's wrong attempt to make a quality science fiction film had the dubious "star" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. HARROW DUNGEON has no redeeming qualities at all. What could have been an interesting plot and suspense about an isolated aristocrat in a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is shattered by the heavy dialogue and the mono tonal action of the fans whose lines sink like lead weights in a sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, condemned this film to the pile of manure. Even the treatment of leprosy is part of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its later stages contradicts the plot that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra, contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle of Sade, condemned to madness and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that no cast member made another movie. No wonder, talent breeds talent; the lack of talent engenders forgetfulness, which is where this film must find its deplorable ending.
