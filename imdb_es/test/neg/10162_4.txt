There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong start, it is not one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne), who stops in a room of 'Halfway House', finds that it is full of corpses, the corpse of the bartender is on the bar with a gun, eyes watch Randy from behind the holes cutting the eyes in an image and a The player plays the piano "The most beautiful night of the year". <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang to get the $ 30,000 from Ed Rogers. Randy is an investigator who "works alone", who loses little time in being arrested, escaping (with the help of Ed's daughter, Sally) and literally landing in the middle of the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. Everything moves pretty fast. Just too much chase after Randy held her back. <br /> <br /> We even got George Hayes, shaved and playing two parts: Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates through handwritten messages. Making him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing of the messages gets old very fast, even for him, since he finally stops doing it almost at the end and says to Sally: "Oh, I'm sick of this ! " You can find George playing a vile, vile and double-crossing villain in the series "The Lost City" (1934). <br /> <br /> I think this is the only 'Lone Star' movie in which the title is related to, or mentioned in the movie! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says: "He is not alone anymore!" Then cut yourself in your arms around each other as you look towards a lake. Sally is leaving with Randy seems too abrupt and is not prepared enough to do so. Too much time on horse escape from the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad considering everything, but it's not so good either. I would really give it a 4 and a half.
