The first time I saw this movie was in the mid / late 80's, when I was a child. We could not even get through everything. The dialogue, the acting, everything on the subject went beyond the lame. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... imagine these spoken in a dramatic, exaggerated way: "Oreegon, you will go to Oreegon, why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?" <br /> <br /> "Survivors! No one has spoken to us about survivors!" <br /> <br /> This movie was SO wrong, my sister and I rented again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit down and laugh at how horrible it was. I think we could not finish it either!
