Thank God I did not buy this movie! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and, of course, after seeing it, I feel they should be reimbursed! This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen! I realize that they could not have had a big budget but I swear I could make a better movie than watching my pets! The performance was horrible, as well as the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that I was getting really angry while I saw it! I look forward to the REAL movie about this story that will come out soon so that people with curiosity do not have to lean to see this joke!
