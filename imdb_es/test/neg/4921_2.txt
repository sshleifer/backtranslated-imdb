There is not enough space to explain the many ways in which this movie is a disappointing disaster. The silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of the problems of this movie. The film seems to have been conceived in the mid-eighties and stylized until it was finally made in the early nineties. The mulet-headed "hero" (which is completed by the three-day beard "Miami Vice"), the punching against Ronald Reagan, would be fun if he did not take himself so seriously. As it is, the movie is just pathetic. In fact, I feel sorry for the poor actresses who squandered their beautiful nude scenes in this horrible movie.
