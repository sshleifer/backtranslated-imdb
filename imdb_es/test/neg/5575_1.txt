This has to be the WORST move I have NEVER seen !!!!! Not only was it boring, it was "biting me with a spoon" silly. Where did you find the actors ... in a corner? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake, I could have made a better movie with my cell phone. And if that was not bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see how stupid the actors are in real life. Whoever made the makeup for the aliens ... must have spent $ 5 at their local used costume store and called it one day. And who in the world wrote the description of the film on the back of the DVD box should be filmed. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8% of what is described as. That description is only to attract people to buy, rent or pay a ticket to see it. No wonder there is never a trailer ... I would have thrown them all away! !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter ) <br /> <br /> Time spent watching this movie ... total waste! (I should sue you for my time looking at it)
