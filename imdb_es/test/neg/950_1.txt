I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to seeing it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer in which I expected a marshal arts movie with a lot of style, with a lot of action and maybe a little argument to think about the way. I was deeply disappointed as it seems that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth seeing (if what you are waiting for is as described above). My girlfriend at that moment surrendered in half and, while I kept looking with the hope that something interesting could happen ... nothing happened. I did not find any attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would say do not bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you really do not mind losing.
