I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and the Mythos background generated some other pretty good stories and things like that. And in the last years some guys who made movies about the work of H. P.? For most of the low budget films? and showed them to the public in places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them do not have a big boost, but at least they know the heart and the "soul" of Lovecrafts' work and movies like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" are what I would do . think - gifts for the fan base and other crazy people who like to create HP. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon, who just cheat the name and create a movie that would have been fun to see if I had directed it myself and filmed with some friends on the beach. That's what Mr. Zuccon did as he seems ... but, while guys like Aaron Vanek or Bryan Moore's previous films might not have had more signings, somehow they still had more to offer, like a story, characters real and some connection with Lovecraft! The mere fact of pronouncing names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" makes a film not an adaptation of Lovecraft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie will not only make Mythos fans shudder and hide, but it will not attract people who 1. like good movies, 2. laugh at the bad movies, 3. like the good C - classify splashed movies or 4. look at all that Horror has written on the cover of the DVD. I will not go into the "plott" of this waste of time, as has already been discussed by others here on this page, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie I had invented with some geek friends. Apart from that, he lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous "nonsense-nonsense-but-he-they are artistic things". It's fun to see the films made by themselves of this "quality" if you know all types and ha-ha. See how XY is coughing up the fake blood we made with ketchup and stuff? But, hey, you do not put this in a DVD case, you declare it as a real movie and you want money for it? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 because I do not know? effort or something like that
