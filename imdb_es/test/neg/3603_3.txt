Another film direct to Disney video, which is essentially perfect for children. The problem with Kronk's New Groove that I find is that everything that made the first movie a fun journey is replaced by a sadder and more somber movie. In this film, Kronk learns many lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a lot of time that could be devoted to creating a more pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns in return and a Mrs. Birdwell hopes to defeat the Kronk counseling championship. All this leads Kronk to confront his father and his disapproval for the direction of his son in life. <br /> <br /> From The Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's New Groove recycles every little time it allows to entertain its viewers. If you loved the original, or are looking forward to watching the next TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
