Amazing! <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the film is by far the worst I saw about a composer and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional things to update a biography, that otherwise could not be so "charming". This was done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this B copy here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but he was a sensible artist. Here in this film, however, it seems much more than Mike Tyson! I also wonder, if in spite of his deafness, he heard all the whispers in the last scenes (can it be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some good teacher. Today most of them lead modern Wagnerian orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
