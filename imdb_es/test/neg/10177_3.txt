My wife saw this movie in the hallway at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science fiction movie, but when it happened, my wife saw that Rebecca St. James was in the movie, she realized it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch her. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" films have a bad reputation in the mainstream. However, we decided to give you a projection. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some things that I liked about the movie. The musical score, largely orchestrated, was quite good. The cinematography was also quite good, considering it was a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any virtue in the production work of this film was lost in a pitiful script. The film begins with an interesting premise, UFO abductions, but in the middle of the film, the plot goes madly on an evangelistic crusade headed by the two main characters of the film ... which then goes madly in a treatise on the Rapture. At least the "The Visitation", inspired by Frank Peretti (which in itself was a very flawed film) had an ending that linked the premise of the film. "Unidentified" does not end even near where it started, which is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As for the performance? The supporting performance varies from decent to horrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a small role and is passable). On the other hand, some of the main characters are sufficiently trained. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities to be incredible. The "protagonists" are anything less; You know it's bad when two Christian viewers consider the most vocal Christian character in the movie the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final note on the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be of most interest to Christian. than non-Christian readers. In a word, it is shameful. Other Christian films such as Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely intransigent portrait of the Christian faith without sounding predicate or oppressive. This film, on the other hand, is a hammer that feels so clumsy and tactless that it would be hard for a non-Christian to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I applaud the efforts to create a good Christian movie. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a good Christian film screening, consider "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion" or (if you are Pentecostal) the provocative "The Apostle" by Robert Duvall. <br /> <br /> Regarding "Unidentified?" Rent it if you have to, but define it before showing it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
