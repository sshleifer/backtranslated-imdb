You have to see this movie! It's so bad that it's really cool. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy, but brave captain, who of course is having an affair with his worn pilot to be a great pilot. And, of course, the collision in the air occurs when the enemy and the captain's rival move on to get to the place. You have your former Vietnam Vet who can not handle the pressure of another collision in the air and a forced landing. Then you have your old crazy Army Air partner who is flying the pursuit plane and trying to do it. I can not tell you what you are trying to do. The plane keeps going up, up and up, and then you have your corporate engineer greedy and immoral, and then you get cold to your Zebra Ice Station and then Lucky prevents the bad guy from drowning so they can land. AND IT DOES NOT END --- ONLY FOLLOWS NOW! You gotta see This. It's great! YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING! DOES IT REALLY SHOW THIS ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND HOW IT HAD BEEN SHOWN ON THE CABLE?
