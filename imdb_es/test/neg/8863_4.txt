This can hardly be called a good movie, in fact it is not even close. But I must say that there were some things that made me ... not to laugh, not to laugh, but something like that. The parody of Resovoir Dogs was one of them. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie disappointed me a little. The plot sounded like an idea, but quickly fell to the ground. Everything was just to mess up and the actors were not good for the characters; most of them simply exaggerated. There were also a lot of non-secretary sequences, which was a total waste of film. I realize that I would make the film about 20 minutes shorter, but it would only make it better. <br /> <br /> Now, with the good and the bad aligned, let's conclude: two. of six toilet seats for this.
