'Flood' is an excellent example of how to cast good actors and CGI to a movie will do little to compensate for a garbage script. The basic premise is good: what would happen if an abnormal storm threatened to send the sea directly over the flood barriers of the Thames and envelop London so fast that most people would probably never leave in time? It's basically the New York segment of "The day after tomorrow," but that should not be less than a movie. However, the script is simply not there. It is merely functional, flat and lacking in depth. Great British talents, such as Robert Carlysle and David Suchet, to name but two do their best with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional figures, like something taken from an old Marvel comic. and it would be downright easier to roll back the tide. It is not that all the actors get off the hook: Tom Courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then they did not give him many challenges. <br /> <br /> I applaud any opportunity to see some - Hollywood disaster films for a change, and I do not expect billions of dollars to be spent on rendering ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for writing badly, especially from a country that has produced the best science fiction that has been done almost without a budget. This is the kind of grade B fluff that the science fiction channel produces, and that's not a goal to aspire to. If, like me, you're a fan of disaster movies, you're still tempted, do yourself a favor and check with some friends. Even better; do not bother yourself
