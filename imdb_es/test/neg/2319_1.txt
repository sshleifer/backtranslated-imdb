I'm going to start ruining the movie first. Eliminate Abbott and Costello from the cast and you get a badly colored film, a rigid cardboard from the casting department, a poorly folded sound (especially during the singing) and an annoying dialogue (for example, listen to the "Mr. Dinklepuss" line) infinity ). Obviously, some hackers thought they could take advantage of Disney's classic "Mickey and the Beanstalk" presentation, but perhaps audiences were more gullible at that time (unlikely) or were trapped in a double feature (more likely). Even children should feel insulted by the showing of this film. A total waste of celluloid. Now, about the performance of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott always played like a heterosexual man and, for the rest, he was the nicest person on the set. On the radio, his character used to be the quick and smooth talker, and he was especially funny when his speed made him change his lines and soften the mistakes. In the movies, he still plays the heterosexual man, but he is more of a con man. Not that it is bad in that, but that character has been interpreted to perfection by Groucho Marx. The real farce of the duo in the movie is Lou Costello. Once again, on the radio it was funny. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He was also easy with the lines, and he made me laugh when I was going to improvise Abbott's mistakes. In the film, I do not know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes an imitation of Stan Laurel, which in turn was made more sordid by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? It was fun on the radio when I was a smarta ... but here it becomes a child character that seems to assault the cameras in each shot. This characterization is shown in each film they make, and only adds a stain to the reputation they had on the radio. What remains of his film career is a poor (very, VERY poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been much more fun if they had played their radio characters instead of retreaded castings.
