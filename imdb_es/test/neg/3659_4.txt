Maybe I saw a clean version, but apart from a few flashes of breasts, I'm not sure what top nudity these other commentators refer to. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not as bad as I expected from the previous comments, although the ending leaves you wondering ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you could not tell the scenes, and I think it added to the chill and the terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> In general, a decently spooky (and yes, brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.
