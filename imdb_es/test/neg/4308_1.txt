I knew it was going to be horrible but not so horrible !!, since it's one of the most boring movies I've seen, nothing happens! All the characters are boring, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring. Also, the ending is especially boring! The only reason I rented this piece of shit because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however, is wasted here, and it looks extremely boring and shows no emotion, plus, I shouted out loud when the movie was over! It's as if the film did not have a plot and it was not about anything, and Ice-T is horrible (although it's fine in some things), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar did not have any chemistry together. There is a scene that the director tried to thrill, but failed miserably, since Yvette Nipar did not really show so much emotion, however, there is a decent car chase scene, but that is not enough to recommend this frightening movie! In addition, the dialogue is atrocious. Avoid this movie like the plague, nothing happens, please, avoid and trust me, you can thank me. The address is horrible! Fred Olen Ray does an awful job here, with shoddy camera work, ridiculously cheap looking assembly parts, terrible angles, ridiculous use of archive footage and keeping the movie at an incredibly boring pace. The acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is neither close to his usual amazing self, he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion, his character is also extremely boring, since I can not believe he signed for this piece of garbage, he did not have chemistry either. with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T has hardly anything to do and also seems boring, and it did not convince me a bit. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, I had a somewhat weak character, I did not like it. Yvette Nipar is pretty but she was really terrible here, she did not show much emotion and she did not chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I did not care about her character. Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh), and the rest of the cast are also bad. In general, avoid it like the plague! Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! PUMP of 5
