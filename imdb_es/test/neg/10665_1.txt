Okay, this movie is well filmed, but it just does not make sense and it does not make sense that the 2 hours that occur seem 3 just for a little love story, <br /> <br /> this could have been an episode of the audacious and the beautiful or the oc, in short, do not see this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes to wake you from your dream. I gave this movie 1/10 because it was the lowest and this is not completely based on a real story, more than half is composed. I repeat that the direction of the photograph is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the film is too much, the nasal voice of the actor only makes me want to go to blow my nose. Unless you're a real fan of the mesh, this movie is a big no-no.
