The genre of parody, which has lacked creativity and humor for a while, is spit once again by pirouettes without talent. It does not make sense, it's not fun, there's no originality; Only a few cheap dollars for filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just making reference to some recent films and giving the characters names of double meaning to be satire; make people laugh. Any group can pick up a security camera, and make some friends who act badly with cheap costumes imitate someone. Since the genre you're targeting this time are sports-inspired movies, there are a few references to movies of that kind: the jokes are so weak that the characters really have to emphasize the references in various ways, to make you laugh hysterically. It does not work. <br /> <br /> That's not comedy. However, the same old "jokes" worn from a middle school bathroom (even more bland than usual) are here. If that is not enough, there is a "gag" of a bus that runs over someone. Very funny, right? In addition, a pathetically poor scene makes more product placement than Michael Bay; Again with the same results without grace. A little music fails miserably. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now gets stuck in roles like this. <br /> <br /> Lousy beyond the words. Seeing a snail running the marathon would be less tedious than watching this movie. Probably a lot more fun, too.
