Yes, it's your typical direct action video movie. And, of course, they do everything possible to change it a bit, but they miraculously fail. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you do not need any talent to star in a movie, only sexual attractiveness. The worst part is that it did not cover my basic concepts of bad movies that are: 1? Cheap looking for villains. two ?? Perfectly timed from a single line. 3 ?? Intense chases in car with massive explosions. 4 ?? The hero gets hooked on the hot girl. 5 ?? Crowds of women naked or with little clothes without any reason. Ok, I lied, it covers that but it does it horribly.
