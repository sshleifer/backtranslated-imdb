All the movies at the airport are stinky, but this is the biggest one of all. The formula was different for this one because it focused on TWO disastrous flights and a lot of wefts on the ground, while the other films focused on a single disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. The acrobatics with the Concorde are worth it to see the laughter, although the special effects are not as terrible as you would expect for a film of this quality made in 1979. The sexist comments of George Kennedy are disgusting and his appointment with a prostitute in Paris It's totally unnecessary (and it made me throw up a little). Poor Martha Raye was relegated to a role in which she did nothing but relieve her bowels again and again in the Concorde bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous movies, which gives you one more reason not to see it.
