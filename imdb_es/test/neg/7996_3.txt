A combat veteran, who has just finished ninjutsu training, meets an old friend in Manila and gets involved in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron. <br /> <br /> But, do you really care about that? If you are even reading this page, you should know something to expect. It's your typical picada, complete with ridiculous dialouge, mega-corny villains, apocalyptic sound editing and a camera that asks for your attention. The only reason to be seen in public with this movie is the fight sequences, beautifully choreographed by Mike Stone and the real master Sho Kosugi.

There are some good laughs: enjoy Christopher George repeatedly shouting "Ninja!" and possibly delivering the dumbest death scene ever captured in a movie.
