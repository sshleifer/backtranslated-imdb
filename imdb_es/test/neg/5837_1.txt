I like sci-fi movies and even low-grade movies, made for television, bargain boxes, movies that I can still find interesting. Well, I found this in a bargain boat and I brought it as a selection for a movie night with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was, literally, * ashamed * that I brought this movie. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning, the acting is bad, the story is bland and the plot is almost nonexistent. All this leads directly to what the movie really was: a soft core graphic porn movie. <br /> <br /> The movie started with a women's prison where the prisoners are sexy women working in some kind of mine. First indication that this film is NOT serious: attractive women in a prison are forced to do physical work. Yeah sure! Whatever is. : P Once the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by meaningless scenes of people having sex. In the middle of the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was stupid. The next day, I thought I would give the movie another shot and see the rest. I watched another 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a science fiction movie or even a science fiction movie, DO NOT watch Lethal Target! If you want to see low-budget, soft-core pornography that's light on the plot, go to Lethal Target.
