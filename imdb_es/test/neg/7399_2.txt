Although unusually in color for a second string, the vivid clothes of the lead females do not give life to the script directed in a flat way. The "plot" revolves around the newly freed Youngers on parole who try to go directly but being pursued by a vengeful former Pinkerton (a scenario that chews on Fred Clark) and a fatal woman determined to involve them in their plans of bank robbery if they want or not. Like Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is big and sturdy enough, but his "great" attitude and his ability to act in wood undermine things. The standard of action is frankly, no better than an episode of Gene Autry or Roy Rogers TV with Colt .45 that never needs recharging and strange shooting abilities that allow a rider to shoot from the hip and injure a man from at least 50 feet. ..Oh darling...
