In a totally unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously and move to "adult" movies, Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. It's true, he has all the clich√©s in the book, fancy nonsense and all that, but the most important thing is that he has Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> She is clearly the best actress to have appeared in a John Hughes movie. she lends him a weight that elevates the sometimes silly material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is quite good as her husband, but McGovern steals the film with his quiet and true moments of honesty. The fun of the 'teen movie' that worked so well in other Hughes movies is not as good as that of a favorite guy whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 years old, but it tells you when you're 15 and you want to find something new. . But I'm still going back to McGoverns performance, because it's really touching. For me, the most interesting films for Mr. Hughes have real actors (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when their material faces a real talent, some wonderful things can happen. If only I trust that it does not have to be mixed with fantasy nonsense.
