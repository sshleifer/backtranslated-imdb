André Roussin was a specialist of what the French call "Theater de Boulevard": works where the eternal triangle is found: lover man / woman / (man or woman). Many of his works gave Elvire Popesco some of his best parts on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to see them, since Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, by far. The French public remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Are you still with me? Roussin's works were not made to be filmed. And this is a pretty mediocre material, even if the writers call Lewis Carroll to his rescue. I like Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is really attractive. But this could be your worst movie. , being coarse, predictable, even the intervention of the native (Bola-Bol) is ridiculous, an uncontrollable farce around a Menage à Trois on a desert island where Granger would be a kind of Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner his girl on Friday .
