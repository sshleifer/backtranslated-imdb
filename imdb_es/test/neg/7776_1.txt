Terrible terrible movie for television. Once again, Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; intriguing a malicious woman to get a stupid and unknown wife of another stupid husband who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I get restless when I watch these movies. You can ask, why do I see them then? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad that I can not get away from it. I wait for the bitch to raise her. And, generally, I'm not satisfied with the way he gets his fair desserts. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe our bitch, steal embryos from the clinic, and how does that make you? Without blood tests, DNA, consultations and recommendations. She proceeds to kill the real estate agent, Gabrielle Rose, who is with her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and nobody sees her. She kills the mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that assumption when the mother, without thinking, mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I will not continue with this. <br /> <br /> Finally, they leave you alone at home with the wife and the bitch. Well good triumphs evil, but too slow. Victoria Pratt as the evil bride is right on paper, she looks a little too sloppy and obvious. Tori Spelling just stares blank most of the time. She has those big big eyes of Bette Davis that seem to be coming out of her head. I liked his trick more. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband who goes around assuring his wife that there is nothing, he and his ex-girlfriend, even though he is seen all over the city being very kind to her, being half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife to the City for the night. However, he continues to deny the romance. <br /> <br /> Life never disappoints viewers with their inane plots and their stories about women and their stupid husbands. I wish I could give this chestnut a rating of "0".
