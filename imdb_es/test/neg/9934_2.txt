I've been a Star Trek fan since 1966. I still am. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are secondary to the characters. Meeting in Farpoint fails in its mission. <br /> <br /> Superbly produced. <br /> <br /> POORLY directed, written, acted. D.C. Fontana really blew this one. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape should burn. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season was not much better.
