Ruggero Deodato is often credited with inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, generally recognized as a Deodato scam, directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is it a good start? for the genre? Well ... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retiring to the jungles of an Asian country, is captured by a native tribe that holds him . captive, force him to work as a slave and, finally, accept it when he marries the boss's daughter. Throughout the whole movie, I never felt it was a horror movie. It was more like a drama, like A MAN CALLED A MAN, which I liked more. Ivan Rassimov is quite good as a photographer, but it is Me Me Lai, the boss's daughter, who is memorable and great. I have always been a fan of Me Me Lai since his impressive performance at JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and he is never credited with his acting skills because he barely speaks in his films. She is still very talented and charming. Much of the true mutilation of animals is the only thing about DEEP RIVER that could turn it into a horror movie, but even that does not work well. <br /> <br /> DEEP RIVER'S MAN is good for those who want to see what the cannibal subgenre began, but as an entry into the genre, it is easily overshadowed by the Deodato entries and even the later entries themselves. Lenzi. Recommended only for complelists and fans of Me Me Lai.
