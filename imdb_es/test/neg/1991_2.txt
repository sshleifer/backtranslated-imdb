I have to ask myself: do movies like this get their support from people associated with the film itself who come here and criticize it? How can something so terrible score so high? My parents went to see many of the adult-themed movies when we were kids, anything with an R until we were old enough. I only remember two movies that had them saying Â¡yech! when they got home East, and "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film is composed of doctors and clumsy staff in a dirty hospital, divergent narrations and a group of people from the city center (who seem rejected from a decade of 1970). Comedy comedy by Norman Lear) organizing a protest. The worst part is the "mystery of murder", a crazy old man who performs the "work of God" by killing doctors and others. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only worry about him leaving where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who falls dead from a heart attack is a fake like the man so he can escape. Oh, my, what a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This movie did not "make me think", he chuckled, nor did he have any other feeling other than "He must improve", but he never does. People wonder why it was a failure, it is not surprising here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think that this movie is good. Yech.
