There was a time in the USA UU In that everything was possible in the film, so the games arose, movies that contained horror and explicit scenes. The best known are the forced entry and the power of water, but, of course, they were made with a little budget. Everything shows up 42 in NY, but hey, there were other grinders out there that did not show budgetary problems. Wet Wilderness is an example of this. Circulated the underground scene after a while, so there were copies available, but as seen in other reviews, some copies were cut off abruptly at the end. But the version I saw was complete. Well, I would call this one more porn than malicious, there is a serial killer but he likes to see others having sex instead of killing them, when he kills, he gets off the screen. Acting is the worst I've ever seen. And I assumed that the supposed actors did not like what they were doing, for example, at the beginning, when we have the lesbian scene, we see how a girl stops acting and pulls a pubic hair out of her mouth and continues to do what was happening, o When the mother rides the black man, the daughter is sitting on the grass upset by the ants! But it is the story that made this famous, incest and racism is what made him famous. When there is blood, watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a signal to act, God, this is worse, but it is still one if you feel like bothering. Make sure you have the full version.
