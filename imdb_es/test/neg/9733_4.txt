Bottom line: Ipswitch used to be a witch community and escaped the Salem witch hunt by forming a secret pact. The first males born descendants of these families have supernatural powers and must accept the seductive and addictive nature of using those powers. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give the movies the benefit of the doubt and I start from a 5, going from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for very obvious audio out Sync, +1 for well done special effects, the darkling actually gave me chills, +0.5 for good coloration (I like the opaque blue), -0.5 for the stupid sound track, +0.5 for the opening sequence - I am a fool for composition with style and design of flashy titles. <br /> <br /> Story / script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 for not explaining very well some plot threads (spiders, darkling), -1 for the boring and predictable ending, -1 for the free exposure, as well as words The screen and as a smooth monologue <br /> <br /> Actuation / Characterization: -0.5 for bad performance, although it improves a little as the film progresses, -1 for lac K of character development, especially among all females <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for male and female nude free, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for scenes without sex, which for this genre is usually done very badly and end up being boring instead of hot, +1 for hitting your target audience, science fiction / horror / suspense teenage fans, even though this movie is not exclusively of any of those genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is not a "movie", this is a MOVIE. There really is nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) fun. Many actors and actresses really attractive. Many guys fight in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or funny frames without meaning, this movie is for you. If you prefer masterpieces of movies exquisitely produced by Oscar, with tons of multi-layered allegorical plots and innovative visualization techniques, you probably will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Using my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.
