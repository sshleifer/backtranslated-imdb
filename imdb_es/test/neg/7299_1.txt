My housemate and I foolishly bought the video of 'The Roller Blade Seven' at our local second-hand video store hoping to find a bad movie to laugh at. This movie is not even ridiculous, it's pathetically poor, worse even than Jack Frost 2, and that's something it says. The script, the acting, the production, the acrobatics, the sound, the sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors have not even learned their lines and are blatantly advertising or, in one case, the lines are read out of series and simply repeat them. Located in the post-apocalyptic 'Wheel Zone', the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many of which are poorly edited or repeated over and over again from different camera angles to lengthen the film. This becomes tedious very quickly. The plot does not make any sense (apparently it's an amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven of them, most of them are not in sheets, they wear roller boots, and it seems that they told me that, in For the most part, the movie has sold out completely on the fact that there are approximately 3 minutes of female nudity in it. Writer and star Scott Shaw obviously considers himself a Samurai and throughout the film he performs some very bad stunts and invented sword fighting movements that look enormously amateurish. Despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional movie because it really pushes the boundaries of modern cinematography. My housemate and I were left speechless by the whole test, and despite my frequent attempts to record the videotape, she has decided that it may be a kind of video Ring-esquire curse that must be transmitted. If you see the video in stores, take it from me! Leave well alone!
