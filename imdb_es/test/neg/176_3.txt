The filmmakers try to paint the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as a parody on par with the German occupation of France and the reign of fascism. But they never find a victim in this movie. We listen to the winemakers, critics and distributors lament that as the wine industry grows, it becomes more and more homogeneous. But the film never confirms that this has resulted in the loss of a good wine or the exploitation of any person or culture other than the naive readers of Wine Spectator with a lot of money. If you want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine, so be it. <br /> <br /> If it were a movie about the diamond trade, where the market dominance of the DeBeers Corporation translates into human suffering, the style of the garbage could have been appropriate. But as it stands, it is Presents as anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. If the filmmakers had existed in the 1870s, they would most likely have protested the grafting of American vines in the effort to save French wine.
