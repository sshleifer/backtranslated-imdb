I was disappointed with the Swan Princess sequel. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how Odette and Derek's married life was going, but the story was not interesting enough to get my attention and seemed to cover the same basis as the original. <Br /> <br /> It's not funny. The only thing I found comical was when Jean-Bob became a prince and then a frog and nobody saw what happened and was trying to convince them that he really did. <br /> <br /> The villain is trash and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The queen is a very irritating character and, instead of encouraging Derek to rescue his mother, you expect the villain to put her. A spell in your voice box to stop your conversation. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really liked the first movie but it did not live up to my expectations.
