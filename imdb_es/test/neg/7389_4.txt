A bad movie, but with a roll that is worth savoring. For most of the movie, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. The fields are bad. Then there is a sequence with Bob Hope and his ex-movie; the dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "Thank you for the memories") light, cynical and charming. Who was parachuted by this bit? However, it makes it all worth the original admission of 25 cents.
