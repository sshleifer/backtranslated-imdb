I really did not want to write a harsh critique of this movie because I really appreciate how difficult it is to do any kind of movie with an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as a science fiction. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is really horrible. The acting is one of the worst I've had to endure and, as a fan of low-budget films, it's a pretty serious accusation. There are many aspiring actors who will work on a deferred payment scheme if they believe in the film and what the director intended to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best as did everyone else involved in this production, but it just was not good enough to achieve something of this magnitude. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. I got the impression that the script was written hastily on the back of a beer mat after an epic session of drunkenness. I hesitate to use the word "laughable" but that is exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. In fact, they criticized me with the result that on more than one occasion I wanted to hit a couple of them, Mr. Stirton has been forced too much by taking on too many roles. Clint Eastwood is not. Once again, there are talented people who are willing to work on the postponement if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the special effects in this movie. For the money, they are exceptional, although somewhat overused. It's like someone says "I have side effects and boy, I'm going to use it". Whoever did CG work was one of the most talented of this team. <br /> <br /> Simply, the money was not available to make a film as ambitious as it tries to be. Congratulations for trying, but unfortunately, it fails to achieve its intoxicating goals in many ways. <br /> <br /> I greet all those involved in your production, I really do, but for your next effort they also need to get a better producer or lower their eyes to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or the usual insomniacs. If you want to see a true masterpiece of low budget science fiction movies, try the "Dark Star" made by a Mr. John Carpenter.
