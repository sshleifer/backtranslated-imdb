And the movie totally without fear. The characters have no interest whatsoever, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is, in the best of cases, ugly, never scary. To interest, a more threatening threat would have been needed, at least some of the people you care for and evoke some emotions in you. And, no less important, something interesting must happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this movie goes on and on, in what seems like an eternity. Maybe a Saint Bernhard was not as smart as a terrible threat to life and society? <br /> <br /> In most horror / suspense / mystery movies, of any genre, there must be characters that arouse interest and make you want to know what happens. Here you really do not care, you just wait for everything to stop and you wonder if it would not be better to see something else. One of the weakest adaptations of the king.
