I wish I could find some good things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) of "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but this would be a very brief comment. The magic that the first had is not found anywhere. here. The animation is pretty poor everywhere, the characters themselves are not very well drawn. The backgrounds and the close-ups are not good either. There is very little attention to detail here. And instead of a compelling and compelling story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and do not make much sense. I swear, even the characters sounded as if they were bored, and would rather be somewhere else. Which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be somewhere else, at least that's the impression. Some of the same actors return for this somber effort, but an integral part of the success of the first was Michael J. Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch. I have the distinct impression that this movie was released together. to capitalize on the success of the first, without much thought or care. But at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "Kida". That's probably the only good thing about this movie, and even she does not seem to have her heart completely in it. You can not blame any of the actors for not giving everything, considering what they had to work with. Or rather not work with. This is a direct video (and I use the term lightly) that should have gone directly to the nearest dump. Anyway, shame on Disney. Consumers deserve much better than this. This receives a 0/10 and a well-deserved one in that.pu
