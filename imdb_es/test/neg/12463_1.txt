I just wish I had the good sense to turn this movie off at the beginning, when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for him to improve. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The performance consists of a boy who wants to be John Cusack, but can not achieve it. The protagonist is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, she can not achieve that either. They are in love, although only God knows why. And in the end, I was hoping that everyone would kill each other just to be able to believe that none of these children would stain the world again.
