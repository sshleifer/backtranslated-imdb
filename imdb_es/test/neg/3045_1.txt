What should have been a routine kangaroo concert in an isolated house on the lake becomes a night of terror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives phone threats from a sadistic stalker, while trying to be a I pass in front of him. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie were pretty good, but everything went downhill from there. The remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80-minute movie. That's a good idea because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this movie to work more effectively, they should have hired a better leading actress, better director, writer, etc. There is no suspense, everything can be discovered long before it happens and it is a very boring movie, since not much happens. . At least there is not much to sit at from its less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise works, then the main actress has to offer realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've seen and throughout the movie, she seemed to be reading her lines. You get a leading role in a Hollywood movie that will be seen by millions of people and you do not give any effort at all! Why did you hire this girl? Sure, she's pretty, but she still can not act. I guess this will not matter to the target audience, which is very likely to eat this movie. The rest of the cast is insipid and forgettable, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the disappointing horror movie Boogeyman from last year. That movie was a lot of cheap fears and false alarms, and When a Strangers Calls is almost the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm, like a cat or a maid. This type of scene is repeated again and again until, finally, after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. He has to be one of the best assassins of all time. He carried no weapons and did not seem to pose a great threat. The ending is bad, but it matches the rest of the movie, so it really does not matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is very bad at creating suspense. I was using all the clich√©s I could think of and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I will give credit to the movie for that. It was an isolated house, so it was pretty spooky, but that's the only good thing this movie has to offer. In the end, if you're not a teenager, you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10
