The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and the director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great while it is playing but can not attract the viewer. The tedious story that Dietrich was divided between two men, became a cabaret star, and that he fights for the custody of his son, is confused and often feels like pieces of three half-separated films. Dietrich is reckless in a rather passive and reactive role for much of the film and his character remains distant from the viewers, while Herbert Marshal is not as convincing as his crabby husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a mild suitor. that bursts in and out of the image. The film contains some intriguing pieces (the number of "Hot Voodoo" is the highest point) that are incredibly surreal for this time in Hollywood, although it is useless in a film so boring and incoherent.
