I came across this movie by accident and I wish I had not done it. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude sequel (and some blood when a man is beheaded) from a well-known children's movie? <br /> <br /> Do not take young children to see this, since the title deviates you, it has nothing to do with the original Snow White, except for stealing your characters. Better yet, do not bother going for yourself, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not see it all, the poor cartoon graphics (as opposed to Disney), and no plot except on how to completely mess up A classic movie made me want to quit and leave.
