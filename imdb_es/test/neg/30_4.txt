Rita Hayworth is awesome at times and, for me, it's the only reason to see this silly movie. Despite the exaggerated lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of Hollywood's glamorous women of all time. In fact, for a couple of years I can not imagine anyone looking better, except maybe Elizabeth Taylor at her best. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the co-star of the show, Gene Kelly, does not play his normal sympathy, at least the kind of guy we all know about in "Singin 'In The Rain". Here, Kelly's "Danny McGuire" pouts most of the time. Phil Silvers, whom he loved on television in "Sgt. Bilko," is just as stupid here as "Genius" that you'll just shudder to hear his silly jokes ... and they're stupid. The visual effects are good with a great Technicolor, which almost looks great. You can also see many beautiful women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not so much. It focuses on Hayworth deciding on a career choice. On the way, we receive the normal treatment of marriage and we have an insultingly silly ending. In short, an unmemorable film, except as a showcase of Hayworth's beauty.
