The update of the work of Clare Booth Luce and the 1939 film is a great disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work, but nothing stands up. There is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film had been made by hand in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Granted, the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how her friends help and hinder her is now less shocking at a time when divorce is so common, but at the same time it's more timely than ever. could connect all the pieces together because as it is now, you really do not feel attracted to the plot. Wait for the cable.
