In my opinion, the movie was ridiculous - bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script, keep your work day. There is definitely no Godfather or Goodfellas. It's good to be on the other side of the table, a bad choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie without actors with a name?
