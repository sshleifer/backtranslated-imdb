So, as far as I'm concerned, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" images associated with the villain, Donnie, are purely symbolic. Actually, he is just a normal human being. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I simply do not buy it. Donnie simply is no more afraid than the paranormal. It is not even so scary at all. As a guy who seems confused and strange instead of malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has just become a killer, is significantly less disturbing than most of the best-known real-life serial killers ( for example: it's like a version of ed gein). That's why Scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and cut nails (something that is not very different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before someone has been killed or injured, is completely out of place. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly shudders. <br /> <br /> Then, as the comic Guy says ... "the worst episode of all!"
