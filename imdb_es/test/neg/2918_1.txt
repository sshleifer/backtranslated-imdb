If one returned to the dawn of the spoken image, he would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedy actor trained on the legitimate stage, not a performance in the purgatory of the concert hall or the vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that corresponded to his image. In addition, from 1924, his "silent" films incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost in the audience (for example, the bell sequence in THE FRESHMAN's Fall Frolic and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). However, Lloyd's sound characteristics consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had diminished. Lloyd blamed his fall on many outside sources, but he never realized that Glass's character's enemy was not solid, but the Great Depression. Pre-depression hearings, dazed by optimism, may have ingrained this ambitious stalker in which they saw their substitute; The depression hearings despised him as the person who would probably foreclose and throw them into the ditch. To aggravate this problem of choosing the character, Lloyd's is perceived as a sincere and complacent person. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic education, could never be convincing. Maybe this is because he was afraid to return to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but only suffers the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was urged to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship willing to soak the rich and the soft of crime. We must remember that I was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the year before. We must also remember that the United States was founded by exalted tax demonstrators and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a "comedy" and because its release was particularly inconvenient, given the events in Germany that year. The 1934 Production Code would ultimately reduce the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, no matter how cumbersome. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the all-powerful and well-meaning leader who produces a utopia once freed from the checks and balances of this omnipotence, goes back to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of the country of origin, shows that FDR's America was safe enough to accept criticism. No parallel criticisms are seen in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the humor of hanging hanging fascism? The unlicensed film by Lloyd is skewed to the right and could have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself if he had had a sense of humor, of course. It raises an alternative story in which a chosen one restores order and loses honor FOR ANY NECESSARY MEANS, and does so with good nature and fun. The impending fascism tackled by the left is, of course, THE GREAT DICTATOR of Chaplin. This last film has the advantage of being set in another country and is based on a person and real events little veiled. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces little laughter today because it underestimated the scope of human evil, but it succeeds despite its witty and inappropriate speech, because it has the clear advantage of being vindicated by history. However, Lloyd should be credited for two things: first, he did not make more pro-fascist films or produced subsequently hypocritical and pro-allied movies during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it was not fun.
