This could have been an important role for Valeria Golino, but the film decided to shift her attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and has three children. He is a free spirit and prone to outbursts, so the rest of the people and his family decide that they should send her to Milan and consult a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa, in Sicily, and shows everyday life there with teenagers in rival gangs and trying to find something to do in the baked rock. Grazia's oldest son, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) loves her and is always trying to protect her during his episodes of depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a young flourishing woman who falls in love with a local policeman and the youngest son, Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very daring and makes fun of the policeman's accent. Upon learning that they will send her to Milan, Grazia escapes and Pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone looks for her. This film could really have had more impact if it had concentrated its focus on Grazia. We see some outbursts and irrational behavior on their part, but there is no follow-up of these scenes. Nothing comes out of it. The film looks great and is very well photographed, so it gives credit to director Emanuele Crialese for that, but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. The film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is happening in the lives of the three children as they grow up. There is some speculation that the character of Golino gives an indication of being a mermaid-like creature and that is why he has difficulty existing on earth. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way and, if you do not, you can be submitted to the harsh realities of its rules. All the speculation, but I think the attention of the films could have stayed with the character of Grazia. After she hides in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a certain sense, the character stagnates. I wish Golino had more to do because I've always liked him and every time he's on screen, you can not just take your eyes off her. It is a package of fury, passion and pure energy! What a shame Crialese did not write a more complete paper for her to act. When the movie ends, your left feels empty because of an incomplete story.
