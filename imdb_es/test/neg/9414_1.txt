I did not have much hope for this. Before seeing it, the story shouted "stereotype". <br /> <br /> I mean ... let's go! It is so stupid the plot about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created it are immoral, then decides to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was incredibly bored by that. It is very rare that movies bore me so much that I fall asleep during them. The third time I forced myself to see it, just to be able to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I had the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool things. from other sci-fi / action movies, and put them together to make a great movie! They took the android / robot, lots of action, thin history, stereotyped characters and a big fight at the end and they threw it together. Unfortunately, the movie stinks. The acting is so rigid that you could build a house with her, the story / plot is absolutely ridiculous, the camera and editing are horrible, the address is non-existent and, to top it off, everything is so clich√© and ridiculous that it just bothers you a lot. <br /> <br /> I was left with the feeling that I could have spent my time watching this one doing something much more creative, like cutting my nails or watching the grass grow.
