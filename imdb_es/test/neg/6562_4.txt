That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Do not waste as in a waste of time (the time you spend with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a loss of opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I watch this movie, I think of all the Star Trek Novels written that would have made a movie much better than the story that Shatner chose. The setup was like an average television episode, while the ending felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Nimoy, in directing II-IV, focused on the character of Spock: how he confronted Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom and how he handled his emotional life now that he had the opportunity to start over. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he did not. We do not know much about Kirk that we did not know before. Once again, one of the novels would have been better: try "My Enemy, My Ally" for an interesting character study by our friend James T. The secondary characters are mainly used for cute fragments, and the secondary plot by Scotty-Uhura It seems to be a good way. outside the left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can not find much to enjoy here. I'm sorry but it's true.
