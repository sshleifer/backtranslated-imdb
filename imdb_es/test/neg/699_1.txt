I'm in a film class and I know I do not know everything about movies, but honestly, this is one of the worst, most stupid, delayed and wasted movies I've seen and I saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. both are equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting happens in the movie. It's not really a touching story and Pat Conroy does not beat anything! I'm not saying there should be fights and trash, but this would encourage more than a bland movie. The children who like to act in this film may have been the real children of the island and amacrax. They sounded stupid and could not act as far as I was concerned. It was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie. I do not know why this movie was made, so deviated among the five worst films of all time.
