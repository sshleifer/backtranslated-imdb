In a year in which "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon" were released, this overpopulated turkey somehow won the Oscar for Best Picture. Half of the movie is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is the telenovela and the melodrama. Heston and Wilde overreact, although they are models of moderation compared to the annoying Hutton. Hutton, who plays an egocentric trapeze artist, acts like an overzealous high school student in a poorly produced school play. Grahame is the only cast member who achieves a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, just to create a long show, no matter how boring it is.
