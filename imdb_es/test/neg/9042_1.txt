Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk Yuk Disgusting! Puke City! The worst piece of junk ever made. Sick. Strange. Horrible. Enough talk. Keep your nose Do not eat After seeing this sick, demented garbage can in a movie, you will not be able to eat your food for a week. But, maybe that's good. A new diet has been invented. Go see this vomit inducing the movie. The stomach gets sick. And he will be so turned off by the whole mess, that he will not be able to eat for at least a week and lose 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Me Me Lay! With a name like this, it's really amazing that he has no "cult" followers. She qualifies as the worst actress in history. His films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This movie qualifies a minus 10.
