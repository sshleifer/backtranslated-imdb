Yes, it's true that Jessica Alba was the one who took me to this movie, because without her I should never have chosen her. <br /> <br /> But, I find it long, boring and, above all, unoriginal. All the time, I thought the story was full of clich√©s and the address was very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and the writer are the same person. I realize I remember to avoid all of his upcoming movies. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because all the good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for once, she has found an appropriate film for this. Bob Hoskins shows great experience and should have won an award for this role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that it makes me open a map of the world to locate this island because, if you guess, it happens in South Asia, you do not know exactly where! Oh, the little plane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie!
