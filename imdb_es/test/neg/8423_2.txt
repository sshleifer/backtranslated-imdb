So what can you do if you're a porn star with a faded look? I know, become a pop star! This documentary, and I use the term lightly, follows the trials and tribulations of Colton when he tries to transform from a gay porn star into an electronic music singer (read: dance). I wish Mr. Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms ... I'm sorry to say that his voice is painfully thin. There are not many interesting things here, but Mr. Ford and his friends are very attractive. <br /> <br /> See how he records a song that sounds exactly like any other meaningless dance melody. See him travel to New York to make "connections". See him return to L.A. with little success. Look at yourself in the mirror and ask: "Why am I wasting my time watching this disaster?"
