Not only why? But "What were you thinking?" This must have been some kind of return to Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those strange movies <br /> <br /> that should never have been (re) done. It pretends to be a Hitchcocks movie <br /> <br /> frame by frame, but without the magic or the tension or the great movie <br /> <br /> doing. Rent the original instead, save yourself.
