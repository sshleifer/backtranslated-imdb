Nothing to see here. Everything has been done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman, deficient in every way, as a mother, as a wife and as a friend? In an instant, when he could have taken the high road, he jumped into re-addiction with both feet and held his breath, not for a better reason than "me too"! If it were not the pretty, young person who portrays on the screen, but it was more like the real human remains that represent our relatives, neighbors and friends who really suffer additions, we would change the channels in a nanosecond. <Br /> <br /> This movie starts at the bottom and goes downhill. Nothing that redeems, lessons are not taught, nothing that elevates in any way. None of the main characters evokes sympathy, much less empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have had more fun if I had closed a door in my hand. Who needs nonsense like this?
