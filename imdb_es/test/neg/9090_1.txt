I was reading in a Stuff magazine about some of the bloodiest and saddest movies that Asia had to offer, and I immediately jumped to Netflix to quench my thirst. What a mistake I made. This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. First and foremost without argument, what I expected to be the plot (see: "Revenge") became a series of events that simply happened in an effort to spend your special effects budget of $ 14.89 and waste time on the study. They should have saved their money and not waste their time or theirs. <br /> <br /> When there is a major twist in the plot, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer is given a new identity and was not buying it. There is a flashback that should answer our questions, but I thought I activated Showtime at 3:47 am and dropped ACID. The film continues and it goes out of control with cheesy graphics and special effects (Olympic). <br /> <br /> Does this movie seem bitter to me? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? No. Was there a plot? No. Was it so symbolic that I did not understand? DO NOT. Was there a body hammer? Beat the hell out of me. So follow my advice and stay !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I must admit I had so much fun writing this and laughing at this movie that if you want to laugh, ¡¡
