I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I've seen this movie because I've heard there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange images of shadows on the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "A boy sells fortune, but his box is empty now". This is really disturbing and it was not really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is about. The film shows how Kinski's character treated the woman and how she kept them under control. If there really are some aspects of Kinski's life in this story, then it really was a pig. So there's no need to watch this movie, unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you like trash movies to laugh at.
