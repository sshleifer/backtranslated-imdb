The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because, for some reason, I felt compelled to finish it! Basically, I wanted to see if there were going to be aliens, UFOs, something suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie. I felt very disappointed to see religion thrown into the mix the way it was. This could have been used to the advantage of the movie, but I felt that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me. Finally, how big was the cast of this cast? I was so distracted by the amount of different and extremely bright T-shirts that each character had in each new scene that I began to wonder if this movie really should not be classified as "poor comedy". <br /> <br /> thumb down!
