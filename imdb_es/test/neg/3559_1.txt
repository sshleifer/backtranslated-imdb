This was the most terrible movie I've had to watch. 30 minutes in the movie and I could not take it anymore. Seriously, do not worry about this unless you're a sentimental fan or one of those pseudo-artistic guys who like this kind of guts so they can feel more cultured. Bored, although the performance is fine; the child is simply irritating. Some scenes are a bit strange with very rare close-ups. I do not know why they made the whole film in black and white, but whatever the effect they expected to have failed miserably. There was nothing to look at, and although it's a sad story, supposedly, it's so stupid that it's hard to feel sympathy for the characters.
