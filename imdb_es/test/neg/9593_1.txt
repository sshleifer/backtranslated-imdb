I laughed, but probably because I was drugged. Apart from that ... this is not a horror movie in any way, there is no horror of this whole movie and the holes in the plot are so big that even a person with an IQ below average would think that I was stupid On top of that, I live in Denmark and I have been throughout my life and I can assure you that Denmark is a country too small in which you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you missed it. I would estimate that, unless you really try hard, you could never be further away from the city or from other people than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Second, I do not think any part of the film, apart from the two shots in Copenhagen where there were none of the actors, was recorded in Denmark. Swamp woman speaks Swedish not Danish. The hull in the first body of the swamp is new. The girl they find in the forest hides under a type of rock that does not exist in Denmark. This is simply stupid.
