I do not see the point. It's heavy. The animated people are creepy (look for an amazing valley). The scenes go on and on and on with very little purpose. The plot is skeletal and must be completed with lots of dramatic and meaningless roller coasters, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning a ride in an amusement park based on the movie. Most of the characters are annoying and unpleasant. Some of them continue to appear as if they have something important to add to a climate scene. They do not just disappear without a lasting impact. Someone summed it up as "if you do not believe in Santa Claus, you will be kidnapped in a train on Christmas Eve". That pretty much sums it up.
