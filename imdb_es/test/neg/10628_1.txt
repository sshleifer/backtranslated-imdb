About the film itself, there are extensive comments. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I've seen recently on TV. It is very cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is usual that the bloodiest scenes are cut for German television. I understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. Not only did they "take blood", but they have cut entire sequences, avoiding only flashes. Like: "WE HAVE to attack them", a 5 seconds shot of explosions in the camp, protagonist who flees. <br /> <br /> When the assault begins on the island, it is no longer possible to follow the story. All the cuts create something that amounts to a series of erratic and disconnected scenes that no longer make any sense. <br /> <br /> I could not bear to see the end after spending 60 minutes in this nonsense. <Br /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10. The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and check the execution time first) or forget it.
