One of the most boring movies I've had to watch, is completely formulated. Only a cut of a movie of a cookie, could be predicted on each scene of the movie just to know the genre, since this movie does not add anything new. Dialogue is never fun, interesting or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying: basically, everything seems to have been done by an amateur filmmaker. Nothing new, memorable or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is LONG, gives you an easy thumb down. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F
