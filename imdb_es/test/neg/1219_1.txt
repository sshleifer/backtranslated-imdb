This movie is horrible beyond any limit. It's amazing, a very bad Jaws scam and other (better) shark movies. A very bad one, everything is really pathetic. The story is pure shit, the actors are bad, the effects are very cheap, there is no creativity at all. It seems that some really weakened children took the Jaws script and arranged it randomly, then their parents took their 8mm camera and filmed the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just some "elevator" music, soft and overly optimistic when nothing happens, and then a little less optimistic when there are sharks around or when children get depressed (again listen to elevator music VERY STRONG). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed that he should ask to have his name removed from the titles! The movie acts as a perfect demonstration of how fucking music will destroy *** ANY *** scene that is supposed to be exciting. However, there is a big difference in Jaws: at the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill sharks with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this does not work, the boys take *** a BIG LOAD *** of dynamite and they spend like 1/4 of the film placing explosives in a sunken ship. This is a really original way to catch the fish that I have to admit! They use as much dynamite as if they were trying to kill a battleship (I'd say it's a Bismarck battleship class) or dig another Panama Canal. This is simply incredible. I'm glad they did not try to use the napalm flamethrower or the tactical nuclear attack to eliminate this evil, shark of about 2m. Well, there is a missing native mystic Indian (who looks like a retired German) also in this mess. This is not a movie, this is a warning example of how bad films can be! As a warning it is useful. But the public should be protected from this garbage. Most Italian films are bad, but this ... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
