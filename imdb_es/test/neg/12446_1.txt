Wow, this movie really swallowed below the normal scale of the boring, boring and unimaginative movies I've seen recently. The performance was poor and robotic. The story was so insipid that it could be summed up with a simple 5-minute short. The audio was so poor and dirty that it was hard to hear it; Maybe it was not edited from the camera from which it was filmed? I'm not sure what movie the 3 enthusiastic critics were commenting on, but this was not it. Perhaps the director had his hand to see that his film received a good review, at least before the real criticism began to appear. <br /> <br /> Save time or you will simply waste your time and money on this movie. Absolute suction!
