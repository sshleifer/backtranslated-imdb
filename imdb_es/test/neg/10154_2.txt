My friend and I rented this a few nights ago. And, I must say, this is the best movie I've seen in my life. I mean, woah! "Dude, it's better that we prepare something before this joint is closed" and "Friend, Linda is not wearing a bra again". What poetry! woah And it's such a wonderful and original movie, too. I mean, normally you can not find a slasher movie in which each murder is exactly the same. I mean, exactly! Now that's originality and almost all transitions between scenes are these great close-ups of the psychopath in the emergency gowns. How cool! The acting is so wonderful. The dad was just brilliant. You must have studied REAL DADS before filming. And how many movies do you find that just do not make any sense? not many But this is one of those gems. I mean, how cool is it that a man had waited outside for about six hours to make a joke, while his friends were inside? that's really cool In general, I would say that this is the best film of the genre, no, in the world! *****
