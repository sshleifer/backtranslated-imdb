Originally, the spiders were planned as a series of four parts, and it shows. I do not like serials; They are typically ridiculous, complicated and banal. This is not an exception. In the first part of the Spiders, 'The Golden Lake', a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a band of criminals, the Spiders, to steal the gold from the Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some cowboys and action Indians. The sensationalism and the exotic of that did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later and much superior work. And, the making of films is better than in other series that I have seen from this moment, including 'Les Vampires' (1915). In spiders, the camera is not so static, and this movie has a fast pace, fortunately. Tinting and lighting are adequate, too. However, none of that is remarkable. However, it is almost indecorous to the extent that this series resembles Louis Feuillade's series; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those of 'Vampires': only the names and, to a lesser extent, the situations have changed. <br /> <br /> For more comments on the The Spiders series, visit the web pages for it.
