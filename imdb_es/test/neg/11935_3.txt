I guess I should now comment on a fourth movie in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; The sequels still surprise me or surprise me because of their sordidness and deliberate absurdity. They constitute or forge a fourth way, not classical, not revisionist, not European, but sordid American, akin to the violent films of the 70s of vigilante, absurd garbage. This delivery is also a bombastic filth, inexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange. <br /> <br /> Now, what I find disturbing is that these sequels not only have their opportunistic followers; but that the fans simply do not perceive any difference between the style of the original and the sequels. "<br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or insipid, but strange, of course, they are very poorly written, disordered scripts, lines Garbage is directly crazy In this delivery each armed man receives several women? Van Cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner, finally he does The young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps the wife, he rapes and kills her, then joins a malefactor, Van Cleef, who had previously refused to help defend a village, now gathers a small group and charges the hacker's estate, then the wrongdoers accuse the town where it is established Van Cleef. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris, Stefanie Powers, quite active in the 70's east, is Van Cleef's darling. , very unfriendly, is Noah, a writer and fellow Chris The rest of the aggressive group are Askew (one of only three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is a truly hot and fleshy beauty.
