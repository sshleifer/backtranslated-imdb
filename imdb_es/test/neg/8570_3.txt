The owner describes it exactly. This trickle of a movie was nothing more than the typical "group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone now that someone is chasing them / killing them 20 years later", a shit that has been pushed through our throats for decades. The only turn is in place of an angry former partner or a kind psycho / loser, she was a nun. The nun wants to eliminate the sin of the girls, blah, blah, the girls accidentally or intentionally drown the nun, blah, blah, the nun chases the girls, the people die, the movie ends. The only thing that made this visible was the scenes of death, which were pretty cool (especially the one on the elevator door that ripped the arms of this fat lady), but they could not even make this a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head for being tied to this garbage. I am happy to have rented it and not bought it, or I would be furious beyond belief. If you want a nunsploitation movie to please the senses, go see Demonia or something like that. Stay away from this garbage.
