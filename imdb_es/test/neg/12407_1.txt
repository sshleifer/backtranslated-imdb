Disclaimer: during my forays into foreign cinema, I've enjoyed a wide variety of films that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few. Therefore, I have enjoyed the serious and serious tone of the dramas, as well as the senseless fun of the popcorn from the action movies. With a wide variety of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my belt, I trust my ability to recognize the bright spots of the films to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to acknowledge. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this over-hyped epic with the sword shows the infamous "slide show" action sequence, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic one. Way of choreography of the action. You just have to show a series of close-up images of faces, swords, legs and / or arms that make faces, and then a dead body. Bravissimo! Now you have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disconnected that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is non-existent, since it is based on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of developing and showing them on the screen, which makes all the characters are generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the story itself is an absolute disaster, since it presents too many characters too quickly and too many plot devices. The intricacies of the plot in the movies can be used very advantageously (ie, A Tale of Two Sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes exploitative garbage when it does nothing but convolute a very simple plot without any apparently good reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, this whole movie acts as a series of smoke screens to cover your deficiencies. The horrific action choreography is covered by "slide show" tricks and chaotic camera movements. The development of non-existent characters is covered by the characters who openly say how they feel. And an unreflective story is covered by confusing the viewer with convolution. <br /> <br /> As if this was not bad enough, this movie was extremely boring, it seemed more like 150 minutes instead of the 95 reals. <Br /> <br /> Rating = A rarely given 0/5 stars.
