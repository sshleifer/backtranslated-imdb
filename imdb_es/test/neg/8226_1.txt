I have no qualms about how the film does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Penalty fee. Whatever is. I lived there enough. I do not need to see a movie that captures the state of the garden. <br /> <br /> What I do have regrets is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easier. We will use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you could not predict the movie in any way): <br /> <br /> -The location of the music was tremendously forced and condescending. Example: Large: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins, have you heard about them?" "Do not." "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Do not you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you, the viewer, how to react to something? I love it! Hey, they should have put subtitles in several scenes that tell us to "laugh", "Say 'aaaaaw'" " I shout "" feel inspired "" etc.) <br /> <br /> -The scenes were SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATICO. Example: the whole movie. But no, really, example: they are in the rainy quarry next to the ark. Big races up, under the torrential rain (oh, it's STORMED!), On a piece of heavy machinery and screaming! Oh, how moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his friend (the annoying drug addict), and everyone complains! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> -The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATICO. Example. They leave the ark and Sam says something like: "Hey, good luck exploring the infinite abyss". And the boy replies: "You too." Oh ... Oh my! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my God! The life of Large is like ... ohmigod ... AN INFINITE ABYSS! Another example: Large and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is this a goodbye?" Is not that enough for you? Well, Largeman says something like: "This is not a point at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipsis." And guess what happens when he tries to walk along the shore and return to his life in Los Angeles. You know what? Do not guess It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - It's a Grade Z Wes Anderson scam movie. When it is not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the film often happens with crazy characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... thanks, Zach Braff for including him, because he really made the movie a lot more textured. Also cheating Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. On hiking friends, "Vagina!" says one of them Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says: "I'm sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says: "It's okay." <br /> <br /> - Inventive cinematography is not inventive but it does not make sense and is annoying. Give me a break with the speed / deceleration of the movie. Once again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his films. And it was done well in "Donnie Darko." But, in reality, it was useless. Wow. A crazy party where people are drinking X and aspiring coca. Better display all the tricks! <br /> <br /> -You can count good times with one hand (even if your fingers are missing). That is what makes it even worse. The quarterback thing delayed ... well, that was good! The little thing that he (the big man) says they are about to enter the quarry (something about blowing the turpentine) ... that was good! Oh, wait, that's all. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But, it's nice. But, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you already achieved it?), Too cute, too much everything. This movie is terrible Apparently, they outnumber me, since this loss of time currently has a rating of 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for something that is truly moving, subtle and unique. DO NOT. RENT. IS. MOVIE.
