Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing joined in a horror movie; That always sounds like a great plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, which previously already starred in fantastic outings of genre such as "The flesh and the demons" and "From beyond the grave", were united in a satanic themed exploitation film of mid of the 70. How can it go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can. To my deepest regret, "the Land of the Minotaur" can hardly be called mediocre, and that despite the cast, the exotic environment, the attractive title and the potentially sound premise. In a small remote area in Greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers continue to feed them a statue of Minotaur that spits fire. Cushing, who never looked more bored and disinterested in any role he has played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek, this means that it also has complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is, of course, quite useful if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also disappear mysteriously in the same area, Father Roch, the priest of a couple of cities before, decides to investigate. "The Land of the Minotaur" is an effort of boring and extremely slow horror that never makes great attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to explain all the potentially fascinating elements and details of the pagan trivia. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason, the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and inadequate noisy music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this great disappointment of a movie an opportunity is by Donald Pleasance. His interpretation of the rude, bossy and antiquated priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.
