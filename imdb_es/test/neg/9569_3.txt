Well, I saw this movie during the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The reaction was ... let's say as funny as the movie is. It happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese into English and then into Spanish. Everything was confusing, the genres were changed (the girls appeared as children and the boys as girls), and my friends and I remembered great lines ... but because they were so absurd. In general, it's not a good movie, but if you ever show it on TV, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie) then go ahead, "visible secret" is your movie .
