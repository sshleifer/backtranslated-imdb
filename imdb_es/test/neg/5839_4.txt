I do not get angry at finding "redeeming social value". Whatever the book or movie that people want to suppress, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to, I do not know, Deep Throat or the latest beheading kidnapping, I sincerely wish they would not. I'm not a lover of pornography or violence as entertainment, but to what I think I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lights, rhythms, almost to the exclusion of fear or excitement, sometimes even missing . Intention of filmmakers or actors. Even from images that reasonable people argue should never have existed, I always imagine that there is something to learn. I wonder more about how he makes a film than what he does. Maybe that's wrong with me. Wiser but harder than deconstruct unpleasant cinema, it could be to see cuts, pans, etc., one by one with and inseparable from any content. I wonder what horror filmmakers and ecclesiastical architects have in common. Add to political filmmakers, fascists and no. All are manipulated with light, space and sound to alter perception and mood. How different are your goals? How different are the targets of those who film real atrocities to use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long trilogy (ANL) appeared on my shelf, I left it without looking for almost a year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I tried a few minutes of "1" the day he arrived, until the stabbing stabbing of the corner, with sound effects, which seems really an attack on the sensibility of moviegoers, and I found it inept but effective. I would have to go back to it, no doubt, but I did not like the perspective. Clearly, this was not the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the cruder but traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant rawness of the old Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> Maybe the word "attack" is key. Matsumura does not attack its characters, but its spectators. I can not see this at this moment in history without thinking so much about Abu Garib (some of whom I think I remember was evident in the video) as in the hostage videos, but also about the torturers of Godard (in Le Petit soldat?) To whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person's workday. And then there's the long news story of northern California, whose details I barely remember but can not completely forget because it also implies "movies", a duo of notorious serial killers, if the suggestion is not to play with my memory, for having been recorded on video. torture the victims. <br /> <br /> The three tickets of ANL are cinema of revenge, exercises of vigilance, but I attach these notes ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can constitute a turning point for the director Matsumura. (I have not seen the entries that followed ANL3). Through the first two offers, I imagined a camera fall into the hands of one of those marginal children of grammar school or obsessively draw scenes of war or other atrocities. (Or as if one of the characters maddened by Matsumura's revenge had become a writer-director.) Anyone who has seen them and who has not seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see it). But ANL3 seems to aspire to the mainstream. The protagonist of Matsumura cultivates carnivorous plants, which allows some typically Japanese close-up nature shots. There is also, for the first time, a Matsumura movie, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's boss stalks and begins to caress him while furtively watching the love hotel customers. Kikou is unhappy between the two. He is a voyeur intermediary. The brief emotion comes from the layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic garbage sipher, a voyeur of garbage that somehow makes me think of the poem that is repeated in Wakamatsu, not in everything that sounds like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. <br /> <br /> I'm not getting anywhere with this, and it's getting in the way of my commenting on other movies. I can not escape the suspicion that in a few years I will enter a retrospective of Matsumura in my local movie archive, perhaps hosted by a learned character who has realized something I am missing. <br /> <br /> How much does it cost? Does it matter if the director is or simply "gets" his characters lethargicly confused? Do you even have to understand them? Maybe a director's job is just to spit it out, and then let the critics, the sociologists and the rest of us take care of things. Maybe director or artistic responsibility is a false notion. <br /> <br /> My final struggle with this thing made me wonder what the hell a woman thinks when she sees these overwhelmingly masculine exercises. We pass women through this over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera, et cetera, and again and again and again and again, but is it something as masculine as the All Night Longs?
