Friday Night With Jonathan Ross must have the people in charge of Ross rubbing his small, sweaty palms. They know that the BBC is unimaginative when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are pretty quiet to just sit back and let a half wit take over this primetime. <br /> <br /> Ross spends more of the show preparing his ego and smiling about how much the BBC is paying him. The program is a complete copy of many EE chat programs. UU (Leno, Letterman, Conan Or Brian, the list goes on), but he and his team have clearly seen that work in the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the United Kingdom. . <br /> <br /> The unfortunate situation: does not it have competition? Parkinson has gone through the reality that he was never able to do much more than prepare a celebrity ego. Can not we have someone more fun and witty on the British screens instead of Jonathan Ross? Once Ross has developed his ego enough, he will move on to the very boring concept of rigid celebrities in the green room, so they will try to move on. If an A-Lister is present (as is usually the case these days, since there are no other chat programs that he can turn to, to promote his latest film), he will spend the next hour flirting with them or trying to be His best friend in the universe. Sqeamish, when he had Ringo Starr, a man who does not care about licking his ass, Ross was really begging for his mobile phone number (as a common policy in this program is that Jonathan Ross get the number of all to be seen in the right company when you're not working). Of course, Ringo said it as it is, and simply said no, I do not like you, do not say it seriously. <br /> <br /> Ross must be expelled from all prizes and television programs: the masses will get over it.
