What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I have not said about other 18 tedious soft-core pornographic films? Very little . It's just another film with a very weak plot that is used to establish very unconvincing fixed scenes between non-actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who obviously have had silicone implants. Actually, the sex scenes in this movie are a little less convincing than what you usually see in this kind of movie, since the cast members move their hips together giving expressions of pain as if they had constipation or something like that. It is not surprising that many people claim that sex is overrated, you have probably seen too many of these movies on nightly cable stations.
