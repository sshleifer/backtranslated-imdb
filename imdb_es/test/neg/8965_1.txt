This movie is truly amazing, in every sense of the word. I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing, and I did not believe it anyway. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Myself, being a mountaineer, I know how it should sound, and it's not Kate's accent in Back Bay. The only thing I found most amusing was the fact that the player who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was chosen as another of the Hillbillies, with a matching accent. Maybe this was a practical joke, now that I think about it. I can not think of any other reason for such a peculiar casting. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island, appeared on this play on Broadway. Can you imagine which part could have played?
