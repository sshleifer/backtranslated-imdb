I do not care what others say, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed in the movie. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but come on! Even children hate this movie. It is useless and boring. Once again, Tom Arnold amply demonstrates that his only talent is losing production money. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why The Stupids has not appeared in the 100 worst movies of all time is that only 20 people will. I admit that you are seeing this garbage. At least the Hobgoblins did it in MST3K.
