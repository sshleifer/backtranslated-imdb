What a shame ... This does not do justice to the original with a horrible performance of everyone in this movie, Hitchcock must be turning in his grave. The scene where they kill Marion in the shower is so ineffective and unoriginal. The only good thing is that they used the same music and it's so obvious who kills her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
