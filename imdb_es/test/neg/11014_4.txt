This is another one of those movies I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to get it out of eBay: 20 years later, it's not as good as I remember it. <br /> <br /> The story is "vaguely" kicked started, by a "cosmic event" (there is another member of the additional film crew in the credits for "developing a weak story") that makes the collective ants become super smart The species of ants that used to fight with each other have ceased to compete and are now working together. What I wanted to know at all times was: WHAT TO DO EXACTLY? You never discover what they want. Nigel Davenport and his companion travel to the desert, where a strange activity of ants has been observed, and begin to study the ants of an impregnable laboratory in the shape of an igloo. Probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visited the giant square in the crops (like a square version of a harvest circle) as a result of the ants they chew. <br /> <br /> This movie was not very scary simply because you do not know whether to fear the ants or how to fear them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can continue with their problems, but you do not know if they are really bad. It is not a science fiction because the explanation of the 'cosmic event' is too vague to be duly taken into account. It's deffo more than one chiller. TBH: the flares, the hairstyles, the tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports, the abnormally large facial hair, they scared me more than the ants! Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? Yes, yes, SIX, and you will not see any other human being in this movie. Not even in the distance! This is a clearly obvious low-budget movie that is a bit visible because you probably have not seen one like it. I can not think of any anyway. The filming of the ants is quite good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stay in the movie. Well you can tell yourself "how the hell do they get the ants to do that?" Again and again, but everything is quite simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers sacrificed millions of innocent ants to make the film as well, so animal rights are kept aside. Good for the value of the novelty, but you may not see it more than once.
