The limited views of the landscape were the only salvation of an otherwise uncomplicated and boring movie. The acting was almost absurd, and I blame the script and the script. Nicole Eggert did not look good, did not act as part and was not as convincing as a mountain guide. After seeing this, I was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie. It must have been produced in a pocket change budget. The plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of the performance, sometimes asked the question: "Why are we doing this?". I managed to sit down for the whole movie, but I also asked myself: "Why?"
