If you just want to gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want at least a hint of good acting, logic, history, consistency or even a good type ending, go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I could not help thinking, "Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?" For example, after being persecuted and seeing other people mutilated, the lead actress meets a police officer and He tells his story with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath driving in a yellow truck. The yellow truck stops and the officer only approaches him, talks to the guy and the truck leaves without any problem. The actress goes out and says why did not you arrest him? And then the truck runs over the police officer ... after being rammed, the truck stops on the road about 20 feet away while the actress tries to drag the policeman, but he is too heavy. (At that moment) At that time, the truck backs up and passes twice over the leg of the police. The truck leaves. Why the actress did not get the gun is beyond me? (Then, she shoots the policeman twice in the head because the psychopath was about to burn him alive) Once by mouth, he did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Roll his eyes * Right after that, he turns around to escape the bathroom that was going to explode and when he approaches the roof, he turns around and the policeman is no longer ... OK ... <br /> < br /> Another example, the main actress encounters a woman trapped in the bathroom, she spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor, covering about 1 / 3s of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress goes out to take a towel, she returns and everything disappears. : / They do not explain why everyone keeps disappearing. Silly dumb dumb. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but this one was too silly. I lost the brain cells watching this drip and you should not either.
