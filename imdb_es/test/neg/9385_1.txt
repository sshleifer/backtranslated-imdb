THANKS TO GOD, YOU ARE HERE, it is painful, positively painful. The title is apt, in a certain sense, if it is aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh as if they were watching the second coming of the Marx Brothers.

Rather, I think that THANKS TO GOD, YOU ARE HERE, is what all those who did not see, or did not appreciate, STUDIO 60, who was previously on the Monday night list in the peacock network. You want to put your nose up in caviar, fine. Here are some lovely Alpo directly from Menu Foods for you to notice.
