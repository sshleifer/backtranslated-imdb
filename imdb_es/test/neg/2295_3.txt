This Swedish splash movie tries to parody / imitate American horror films like "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and others. The writer / director / actor / cinematographer Anders Jacobsson and the writer / producer / actor / makeup effects supervisor Göran Lundström (did I miss something?) Obviously they were inspired by Sam Raimi. But the work of the camera is a bad copy of what can be seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this movie, but I did not. <br /> <br /> The movie bothered me more than entertaining me. Try to combine suspense and comedy, and the final product left me with a feeling of oppression, although it was not scary or shocking at all. The combination of different elements of the genre made this film very strange. I never knew if it was meant to be scary or fun. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, except for the confrontation in the hospital, but I did not like the way it was done for the reasons mentioned above. . The effects of gore and makeup are considerably good and at least the sequences of "Loose Limbs" were quite entertaining because in these scenes the filmmakers did not try to mix fears and jokes. <br /> <br /> In general A strange movie that you will hate or love. Rest in pieces, Ed. Evil. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stay with American productions)
