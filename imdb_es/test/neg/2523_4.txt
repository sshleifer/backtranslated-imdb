When I attended college in the early 70's, it was a simpler time. Except for a brief incident in 1994, I have been totally free of the influence of illegal substances since then and have never regretted ... until now. DB: TBTE has to be, without a doubt, the best movie to watch when it's drugged. The strange dream state you create is very strange when you do not smoke anything, but I'm sure it would seem completely normal after a big problem. (It's not that I recommend it, you understand.) The relaxing narrative, provided, as often happens in a quality cinema, by a victim of tuberculosis trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the drugged spectator move on as the things start. Complicated. In addition, everything in the film is quite organic ... from the old-fashioned natural breasts to the fried chicken cube. <br /> <br /> Now, there is also no doubt that the young man with his hand (ahem) The problem "is absolutely moving away in the movie." At a certain moment, you simply KNOW he's going to say: "Hey! When I move my hand, it leaves traces! "Trust me ... you'll know when you get to that point. <br /> <br /> The only thing we have to address is this: How good can a movie be when at least half of the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame for indoor and outdoor shots? <br /> <br /> Definitely a must-see for horror fans, but suitable for the general public in the conditions right (if you know what I want to say and I think so), only earn four stars because I really can not say that it took some talent to do.
