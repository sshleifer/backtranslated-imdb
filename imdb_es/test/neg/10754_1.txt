I went to see this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London, as a birthday present. It was the first time I've seen it, and I think it has now surpassed the terrible "Twister" as the worst movie I've seen in my life. Disconnected without reason, self-indulgent and full of images that range from the gross and obvious to the dark and unintelligible, not particularly beautiful or with a grim image, I really do not understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I usually like movies that push limits or even movies that are hard to see due to their unusual length or cinematography. But this was truly, really horrible.
