I am a fan of good historical fiction, and I was thrilled by the idea that someone would take a series of well written books and film it. Writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book that you are adapting, it would be good to follow the plot. <br /> <br /> The representations of the Vespasians (the royal Emperor, and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) was horrible. They acted like a Caligula cookie cutter, and they were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. There was a scene in which Tito imposed justice as if he were Caligula (from the movie of the same name). The way in which the Vespasianii appear in the books, mostly follow the reports of historians who wrote in that period of time: they were fair and sensible, not contaminated by imperial insanity Claudian. <br /> <br /> Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) gives as his reason for divorcing Pertinax (one of the traitors mentioned in the title) was that he was a traitor. However, in the books it was because he He ignored her and she felt it would be better if she married someone who would value her as a person. <br /> <br /> Marcus in the movie has a slave named Justus, but in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone a slave. Certainly, there was no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave Justus and a gladiator ... <br /> <br /> In general, if you want good Roman stereotypes, get Caligula, if you want good Romans from the classical story point of view, I understand, Claudio.
