The Grudge 2 is one of the movies that makes me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in the English language. With a plot full of more holes than a net of trawlers, this film does not achieve a compulsive display for a fan of the most insane movies, which I am. I felt compelled to stay at the cinema until I got Â£ 5.70 p of entertainment, although I was afraid I would be there for a few years. You could make a better movie from the shots of the first installment of The Grudge, although I'm not entirely sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. As expected, what goes through a plot in this terrible example of wasted celluloid ends without any resolution, leaving the producers with the option to inflict 'The Grudge 3' on the public when the time comes for them to feel another twinge of true hatred of civilization.
