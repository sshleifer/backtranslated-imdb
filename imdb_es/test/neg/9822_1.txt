Where do we start with an offering like this? I almost said movie but that would go too far. The only hell of this movie is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, nonsense and balderdash. These films must carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage the spirit to the point where one might believe that all good filmmakers have left the planet and their resources have been delivered to the cabarones that have made this classic piece of garbage . As if she were a sister of arms "League of Twaddle Extraordinary." They are neither science fiction nor facts, they are entertaining or provocative of thoughts, humorous or heavy, but they are in a penumbra area without elements or elements that incite people to give up their valuable time, to sit in a dark room and, in general, to be more enlightened and animated. or happy at the end of it. If we could award "Turkey" points for films like this, this would be a turnip, since we would go through the turkey, the ham, the potatoes, the sprouts, the sauce and all the other adornments before reaching the bottom.
