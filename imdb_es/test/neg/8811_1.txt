There were so many things wrong with this movie that I have trouble keeping them in order. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one lying on the floor in the bathroom, what would happen if Zep never showed up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before coming to the bathroom? Jigsaw just gets up and goes out? Could the boy in the middle of the bathroom not be a puzzle, but another part of the Jigsaw game? What would happen if Zep killed the wife and son, how does Jigsaw give him the poison antidote if he is in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was after six and, as far as he knew, his wife and son had already been shot dead, it was not the best moment for heroism. These are just some of the questions I had about the film, but it's possible that I'm missing something or everything, since I've only seen it once. Please help!
