Like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this film can not distinguish between explicitness and eroticism. There is no accumulation of anything, just throw naked women on the screen; No, it does not work that way. If the close-ups of the female genitals are not your thing, be prepared to look away from the screen at many points (I often did). The mentality of "all women are whores at heart" of the film is offensive, and the "story" is absurd and boring (escape is the most boring part!). But halfway there is a random scene that appears out of nowhere and involves one of the prisoners (women) and one of the guards (men) in a naked fighting fight, which wins with a couple of judo moves. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is certainly memorable. In fact, that scene and good photography are the only two reasons why I give this film * of 4, instead of 0.
