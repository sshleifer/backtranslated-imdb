While I was in Madrid I was able to see a copy of this movie. Woohoo! Gallo is amazing in that. The performance it gives is very unusual. Apart from Gallo's genius, the film, however, is a boring movie that I have seen in my life and, sometimes, it is so poorly made that it borders on the ridiculous. I'm also a Val Kilmer fan, so it was part of the reason why I made a great effort to watch the movie. The problem is that Val is really just in one scene. Having his name in the cast as a protagonist is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I've only seen Stranded from the directors other films. Both films are well below average, but both contain very interesting performances by Vincent Gallo. If you're such a fan of Gallo like me, then I see this movie no matter how bad it is. If you do not like Gallo, then you have ZERO to love.
