"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and violence inside the city; unfortunately, the message is invalidated by the meaningless script, the amateur production and the hard-pole controversies. What hard hand, you ask? To give you an example, a black doctor comes out of hiding, unarmed, with his hands up, ready to surrender to the police: one of the police (all white) says "Do not shoot him, he's a doctor", to which Another policeman answers: "So what, he's still an imbecile," and proceeds to shoot him in cold blood. The policemen are portrayed as ignorant racist murderers, although in the end there are as many dead as there are among the blacks who staged the riots. And all this event was intended in some way to "sensitize" whites about the degrading treatment of blacks, when in reality something like this can only generate more hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, as Williams' girlfriend, briefly illuminates the screen with her smile and body, especially in a scene of tender sex, and raises the rating of this film from 1 to 2 out of 10.
