Fox is pretty lame. The wrong shows are canceled. It is strange that they cancel a well written program like "Arrested Development" and, nevertheless, keep this program and "War at Home". I feel that Fox loved that they broke down barriers with the then "Married with Children", but now it's getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a mindless and boring watch, and its nervous jokes simply fall. For the avant-garde comedy to work, you have to keep the jokes to come. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox needs to take his head out of his rectal cavities and let his family write this mediocre gut. I mean, if you're going to invest money in doing something entertaining, make it entertaining. Also, stop using "nameless" actors. It's great to have promising, but you need to anchor a show with a prominent celebrity. Duh, Fox.
