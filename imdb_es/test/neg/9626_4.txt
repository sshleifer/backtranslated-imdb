Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and works of art, the circus and the ethereal feel of the film was sublime. It only required the viewer to care about the destiny of our protagonist. As it is trapped in your imagination, there is never a feeling of danger unlike, for example, David Lynch's films that beset each time. This also draws attention to what age group this film is aimed at. Who would you get involved with? <br /> <br /> Mirrormask is obviously going to make comparisons with Labyrinth to the adolescent-anguish / fantasy theme, but unfortunately it does not come very close to delivering the very essence of Henson. The subject of the sick mother is never completely explained and, certainly, it is not something that matters to you while you tick the candy. <br /> <br /> It is not terribly horrible in The Cell, nor as captivating as the labyrinth: a forgettable but good Looking at fantasy.
