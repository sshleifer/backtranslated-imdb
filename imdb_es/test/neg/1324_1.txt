I love Das Boot. I expected something similar: a realistic war movie, portraying the soldiers and civilians on both sides as real people, with the joy and pain of combat. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that Stalingrad has been written. by a third grade student and directed by a fifth grade student. The main pieces of the film simply appear as missing, leaving it completely disjointed. The dialogue in the translation is ridiculous, but it does not appear better in the native language; you just have to look at the faces of the actors during the bad moments of the dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
