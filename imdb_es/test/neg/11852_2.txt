This movie is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users, (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses archive images from the Carnotaur movies. Well, since I have not seen the Carnotaur movies, I can not say. But, I realize a pretty bad edition and worse still acting. This movie is a big smoking stack of s ***. It has absolutely no sense. This is what he calls himself PLOT: the mad scientist recreates the raptors. The kidnappers kill people. The sheriff investigates. * SPOILER * (although I do not know what I'm spoiling) The Sheriff realizes the crazy doctor's plans. The army boys are sent and the kidnappers begin to kill the army. The kidnappers. Yeah sure. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. The FX are the cheapest ever used in a movie. There is a lot of blood. Cheap gore Does not even look real. I will agree with another person who qualified this movie that the only thing this film has in its favor is the fact that it ends. There are about two seconds of originality in this movie. And that's only because the bailiff is talking to a tax agent over the phone about his electricity bill or something. This idea has been used in 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. In general, I'll give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it's over.
