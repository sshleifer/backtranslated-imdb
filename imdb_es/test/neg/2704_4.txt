Although this film is inaccurate in general, there are some elements that may be true. Certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes with his fellow cadets at West Point, almost ejected several times, graduating last in his class (of 34), and often reckless in his leadership during the Civil War. br /> <br /> But history may have made him a scapegoat for the Indian Wars. Certainly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? In addition, there is evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he argued about the impartiality of breaking treaties with the Indians and that if he were Indian, he would also fight instead of living on a reservation! <br /> <br /> As one character said in the 1776 play when he was asked what would be said about the British about losing the War of Independence, the character states that "history will do what it always does ... lie". Who knows how bad a Custer man was? Certainly, it was not the sympathetic character portrayed by Errol Flynn and then Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely evil, as they portray him later.
