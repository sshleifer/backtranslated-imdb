PLEASE?! If it's about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I did not understand his point. Because I left feeling that Reggio relied on the images of space exploration from the Cold War era and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about the fears of technology. Traces of 1 and 0, which denote technology, mathematics and science: I DO that. Does anyone out there see the matrix? And the studies of movement of people in movement? Have you heard of Edward Muybridge? At least use exact clips from Muybridge's photographs of human movement studies. <br /> <br /> This film was derived, and the score is enough for Philip Glass to sound like EVERYTHING he's done in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie at ALL costs!
