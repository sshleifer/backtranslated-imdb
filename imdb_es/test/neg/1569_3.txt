George & Mildred - The Movie lacks the talents of its television writer John Mortimer, who brings the cut and thrust of George's class war with the Fourmiles alive. <br /> <br /> The weft is cut with a standard cloth. - hit-man / mistaken identity - and has as little tension as laughter. Producers should have taken a sheet of Rising Damp (also in 1980), which was also purchased on the big screen after the disappearance of the television series, and kept much of the story in a familiar setting. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but she should not be remembered for this squeaky work that is hampered by her illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her TV incarnation; cut off secondary aspects and glaring looks directed largely at the lack of Georges libido. George's disbelief is also lost in more expansive sets. This does not mean that they had much to scream. The budget for these films seems pathetically small; a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi-starched house with some Christmas lights that adorn the front door. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the British comedy of the 70s or those who just want to visit an old television partner from their youth. This film can not add anything to the experience and should be limited to the first four TV series that are now released on DVD.
