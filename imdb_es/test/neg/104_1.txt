This movie had a very special effect on me: it stalled me to realize that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a "movie of thinkers" like Memento and other gems like that, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize that this is nothing more than an absolutely pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with friends, compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is ?? I do not even know if he tried to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, by the way) with stupid "enigmas", the kind you learn at recess in elementary school. Suddenly you get to the "only truth" of everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How, what, why, why? It's like saying that to make a cake, simply throw in a bunch of ingredients and add water. forgot to cook it? I guess these guys forgot not to explain, but they present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story in which normal, everyday acts (solving rare lies) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute in front of the camera, and the Highlanders guy, the series, acting like the heavy metal record store (yes, they're all real though s-o-b). The "threatening" atmosphere, with the enigmas "oh-so-intelligent" (enter the series of Batman and Robin of the 60s, with the appearance of The Riddle) and the crazy people who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smile on their faces. ?? simply horrible, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> I'm usually very partial to low-budget films, and I tend to encourage the weaker by giving them more praise than they can deserve, instead of their constrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end you'll only regret that you've fallen in love.
