Tom is about to get into a delicious Jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey pounces and flies away with his snack. Not at all happy that his sarnie was stolen directly from under his nose, Tom goes in search of something hot, determined to recover his morsel. <br /> <br /> As much as I love Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this is a little stinky: the story is pretty mundane; introduces a poorly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; and whips the old 'dress up the cartoon character as a' woman gag '. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 'Flirty Birdy' rivals 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of Weakest Tom and Jerry Caper so far.
