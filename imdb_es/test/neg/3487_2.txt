The bad news: the Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar released by Maple Pictures that I saw was of poor quality. Dark and washed, it seemed to be folded at random from a VHS tape. It even jumps at a point because some frames are missing. <br /> <br /> The good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD left little to my visual enjoyment. This horror movie does not manage to increase the tension and is not afraid. It's a horror movie without horror. While most scary movies have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is an artist contest, so much so that a character will repeat something we just heard from two other characters. Presumably, all chit chat acts as a filler for an unimaginative and low budget movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not hectic enough to be worth seeing.
