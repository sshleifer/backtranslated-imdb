First, the current description of the plot of IMDb seems to be misleading, the film is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynist hitchhiker, who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he keeps them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence occurs. <br /> <br /> I detected it by mistake, thinking it was the other 2007 movie "The Hitcher". It's not like The Hitcher is better, and I was looking for a horrible movie to watch anyway, but sometimes this was almost unbearable. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this one. <br /> <br /> I can not count how many movies I've seen with practically the same story, so sometimes it was almost painfully predictable, but what really made it horrible were some scenes that ... well, let me give you an example . At one point, a door is covered in blood (which is very obvious), and two police officers, on the scene because of a 911 call, are watching from a distance of 30 feet, they see a man, also covered in blood, which comes out of the door, accept that it seems suspicious, but decide not to continue investigating. <br /> <br /> But, ridiculous as it is, the film was never boring, it was well produced, directed and performed, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudes, and violence. I probably would not recommend spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect for me while cleaning my basement. It is also highly recommended for fans of poor quality movies, and it would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to talk more than watch.
