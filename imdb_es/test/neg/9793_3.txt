A tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the enthusiasm and madness of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933". The Production Code was firmly in place when the film was released, so the humor is that of the whole hokey, wocka-wocka variety and the dry phrases that sounded so cosmopolitan were dripping from the lips of the beautiful ladies of the first film A cast of second-level stars and character actors review the movements here, and the "put on a show" motive seems terribly forced; Instead of the world of Broadway, the show here is a charity event organized by a swanky hotel. Who really cares if the show continues or not? The score here is bland too. Of course, the great number of the film is "Broadway Lullaby", which accompanies a long number of fantasy dance about the eventual disappearance of a New York socialist party for party excess, does not have exactly the same effect than the "Forgotten Man" number used. as the end in '33. Busby Berkeley directs and choreographs this film, and any promise that builds on the fluent opening of the film deteriorates rapidly. Unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was another Gold Diggers movie two years later. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
