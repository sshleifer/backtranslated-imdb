When a group of businessmen begins to die in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to rise, Mr. Martin obviously is not having much success. At the end of the film, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users who commented on this state "This is a classic movie and should be ENJOYED and not chosen separately". I'm sorry, but I have to disagree respectfully with this opinion. It is "classical" only in the sense that it is old, not in any sense related to its quality. I have enjoyed many low-budget "B" movies of this period, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is unbearably slow, the work of the camera is quite insipid, most of the performance is quite rigid (even Lugosi is not very good in this case, in my opinion) and the plot, if Well it has an interesting premise, it seems to be organized in a very difficult way to follow.
