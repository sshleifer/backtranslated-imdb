Honestly, I do not know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? But yes, this show is incredibly funny if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying Al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. It's more annoying than fun. The frames are all the same, Tim makes Jill angry and has to fix things again. and the last stations? the less said about them, the better, who the hell would a damn comedy be good for cancer? Yes, great idea idiots. so yes, home improvement is not a good sitcom. I recommend you go to see Radio News or Seinfeld. If I had to give a rating to this program, I would give it a 1/10 since it never made me laugh once. forever. so yes, it's still better than the nanny.
