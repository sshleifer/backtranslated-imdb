Like most, I rented this after hearing the universal praise. And in spite of the strange and inexplicable moments of COUNTLESS on the way, I was very interested and entertained during the 100 minutes of the movie. Then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. The rest of the movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even MORE LEGACY than the first part and contradicts and completely discards what I had already seen. Then, the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Puzzled, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a clue about what just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a very smart kid. None of these comments from other users made sense, even when they say "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they are saying. Someone's dream? Unreal? So, what's the point of a 2-hour and 30-minute movie if "it's not real?" Or is it real? I am forced to make a decision. Or: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is a great work on a MENSA level and I am simply too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The movie is rare for the sake of strangers and it just does not make sense. Everyone who loves him is trying to save his face and pretend to "understand" him. <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. To hell with you I'm going home ...
