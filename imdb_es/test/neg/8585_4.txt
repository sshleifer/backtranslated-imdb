Stone has tried another type of movie. Any given Sunday does not reach the previous average The Last Boy Scout and the average lower against all odds. The stone can be fantastic, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers or Platoon, but you can also repeat that you see Nixon or Born on the fourth of July. Its real brightness is realized in the perfection of Michael Caine, The Hand.
