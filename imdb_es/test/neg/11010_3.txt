I heard that this Japanese film is avant-garde, creatively interesting, a "new and great sign" in the Asian film scene ... maybe even something as innovative as "Ringu" by Hideo Nakata or "Oldboy" by Chan-wook Park, especially the last. <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when, instead, I found the film disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in a way that a movie fan appreciates), clich√©, even sadly silly-funny-in Generally, a very bad imitation of the style "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> I stopped looking after 30 minutes, when I gave up and became something more than what it is. .
