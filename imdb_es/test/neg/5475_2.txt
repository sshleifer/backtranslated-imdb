My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance must have been desperate for work to have lent their talents to this turkey. A horribly confusing story about Satanism in modern Greece, Land Of The Minotaur (also known as The Devil's Men) is a fire on every level imaginable. He has very few fears (always a small flaw for a "horror" movie, do not you think?); weak performances; innumerable scenes where the characters foolishly deviate alone or reject the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group; and some rather irritating editing techniques that do not add anything to the procedures. I got excited prematurely at the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends, but this movie is not worth the remotest excitement; It is a great disappointment and rather an embarrassment for its much more valuable clues. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, strangers, like tourists and archaeologists, continue to disappear, and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something sinister is about. He writes to his friend, the private eye of New York Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), and asks him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, three other visitors, Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), who are all personal friends of Father Roche, disappear while snooping in the nearby Greek ruins. Milo finally arrives in Greece, but at first he has doubts about Father Roche's beliefs that the missing people have been kidnapped for satanic sacrifices. Milo and Father Roche are also accompanied by Laurie (Luan Peters), the missing Tom's girlfriend. Together, they discover the activities of a Minoan cult of devil worship headed by the spooky exile of the Carpathians, Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazed cultists have been sacrificing their victims for a minotaur statue. Also, apparently they can not kill themselves by normal means, so Father Roche has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them. <br /> <br /> The Land of the Minotaur should have been much better than it really is. The plot is so extravagant and unlikely that it has all the hallmarks of a goofy goofy cult / camp goofy favorite. But the handling is just horrible. The director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to relate the narrative to each other in a cohesive way, so that everything progresses as if it were being invented day by day. He also has no idea how to convince convincing interpretations of his cast, so they are left to embarrass themselves in the terrible interpretations hammy (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateur (Skouras, Peters). The worst thing is that the narrative does not make sense. Why would Father Roche seek the help of a private eye that is absolutely implacable about his beliefs? How does Roche know that sacrifices only occur during the full moon? How can the statue of the minotaur speak? Why is one of the sacrificial victims instructed during a vision to stab Father Roche, only to be stabbed a few scenes later before he has the opportunity to carry it out? And, most disconcerting of all, why does Father Roche drag Milo to the middle of the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and a little holy water to get rid of the bad guys? These questions, and many more, will appear in your mind during the Land of the Minotaur ... but, unfortunately, there are no answers that you can have. Frustrating, silly and disappointing!
