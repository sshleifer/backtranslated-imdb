All the professional comments about this film affirm that the film is balanced. That is his main justification for giving a high rate to the film. But a film is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed receives the last world in each subject. The director herself admitted it at the first screening of the San Francisco film festival. She justified it by saying that she could not lose the opportunity to have access to Fujimori. That could be true, but by showing much of Fujimori's opinion about the problems, the film is clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare that any of the other commentators show that he is wrong. Tips 1: affirming that Harvard Latin American professors, intellectuals and diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: disagreeing with the director does not help in his discussion either (the director says he thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and that's why he portrayed him that way)
