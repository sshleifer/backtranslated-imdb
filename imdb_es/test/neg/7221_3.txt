Spoilers! <br /> <br /> I hate this, but it's better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse. I hope Gibson has the intelligence to stay out of the next. The same happens with humor, that is, the toilet, children, etc. How far can we see how your relationship evolves? Drugs, bad guys why South Africa! I thought it was incredible, maybe South American, that some country in the Golden Triangle would have improved the script. It seems that in the late '80s at the beginning of the 90s, the blonds were bad, that is, Die Hard, the powerful Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself once more. This one with a similar story has to go above. The attack on the police, the condo scene on the beach and the fight at the end, and over Gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack, were too much. Like many parts 2, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series increase the speed downhill. 3/10
