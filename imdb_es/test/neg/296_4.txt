I've been hearing a lot about this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia in the last three years. Apparently, it is about to become very contagious and millions and millions of people will be eliminated in a global pandemic. I just thought I'd mention it in case you still have not finished writing your will. <br /> <br /> I also thought I would mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight, which was not about naval warfare, but it starts with a scene that is a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago. I thought I would be seeing something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu, but after the opening is not impressive, CARRIERS descends to a cheap and cheerful TVM, and like all other TVM, you will see that the characters The main ones are women. , one of which is an authority figure, while the other is a mother of small children. It goes without saying that there is also a secondary argument for the sick child. <br /> <br /> What is irritating with the TVM format is that it exceeds the potential of what could have been a good movie if it were made for cinema. There is a pretty bloody scene of someone coughing blood all over the face of a nurse and a very impressive jay walker who gets stuck in the trick, but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood becomes familiar feeling since this (and almost all the other TVMs that have been made) was made for an essentially female audience
