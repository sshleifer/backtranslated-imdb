Royal Rumble 1988 bored me pretty well. The rumor itself is pretty quiet, it's full of intermediate players and a winner that really makes no sense in winning, and why the hell was the main event of The Young Stallions Vs The Islanders? Half of the crowd left. Jessie Ventura sounds boring, through half the thing, and it can be said that when she mentions that she finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura do not have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs. Ravishing Rick Rude. Very disappointing game, with too many reserves of rest and too slow, sink this. When he goes crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Next up is Dino Bravo, who is trying to set a new bench press record, and Ventura finds it. Horrible segment, no entertainment value than ever. Ventura is not enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted that it was boring. Controversy or not, I lost enough time in this shit. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Championship of WWF Woman. <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Los Angeles From The Jumping Bomb. This is the best match of the night, no, I'm not kidding! Very exciting things for the fight of the Woman, and it will be difficult to find such good things, nowadays. The Angels of the Jumping Bomb were far away, and the crowd went crazy for their victory in the title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing of contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan receives a decent pop, but there are a few notable hits for him, probably because he's in Canada. A little too elaborate for my taste, but it was necessary for the story. He has his point of view, and had some effective moments, but many times I kept saying "Keep this up". They both sign, and Andre hits Hogan's head on the table and pushes the table over him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Royal Rumble very weak, probably due to an uncomfortable rhythm and the true lack of power of the stars. I think Vince was testing the waters with this, and he showed himself. Ventura seems disinterested, and I do not blame him. Clearly, the crowd wanted Roberts to win, screaming DDT almost every 5 minutes he was there, and although Duggan got a good pop, I do not think he was the winner they wanted, and where did this lead to his career? Nowhere. The first Royal Rumble of Bret, and made an impressive performance. It was not terrible, but it was quite mediocre, and he did not have enough to do the program, considering that the program was based on this. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Hulkster's standard interview, but not with the same madness, and outrageous comments he usually makes. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre are interviewed. Andre says he will deliver the Championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short, but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 falls. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them shot out towards the exit. It's pretty boring, and I had nothing to do in the main event. Jessie and Vince seem bored, and they argue about other things while the game takes place. The islanders win, due to take advantage of the injury of Rome. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> In a few words. Historically important, I suppose, but there really is nothing to see here. This was just a starting point for the great things that will come for The Royal Rumble, and although you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing here, that goes out of your way to see. I usually recommend everything once for Die Hard Wrestling fans, and considering it's the first Royal Rumble event, I suppose I do too, but I prepare to get bored most of the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
