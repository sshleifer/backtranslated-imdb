Before starting, I must inform you that I love horror movies with passion. LOVE THEM! I have seen thousands and rarely do I see one that I do not like. I am very forgiving of the horror genre. One of the best lines in the history of cinema is in the movie "Ed Wood", where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is scared and shouts at the producers too critical after they comment on the "cheap sets and continuity problems of the "Plan 9." Do not you know anything? You've never heard of the "suspension of disbelief?" "Well, I try to take that philosophy of" suspension of disbelief "to every horror movie I see and for it usually works Unfortunately, it did not work for me during the screening of Cheerleader Massacre. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice about this "movie" is that it was shot on video and has that style of digital camera handheld. The work and the quality of the camera are so bad that they make the day soaps look impressive in comparison. In fact, it makes the videos of Troma and Full Moon look good. And that is bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski. This "filmmaker" is probably considered a chip by old Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman fired fast, furious and under budget, but was able to deliver an original film adjusted. Although Wynorski delivers a cheap movie, he tricks his viewers (and perhaps other artists) while stealing entire pieces of the musical scores "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" by James Horner and improperly places them in the massacre of cheerleaders. In the back of the art box and during the initial credits, the musical score is falsely attributed to Dan Savio (an extra in Wynorski's "Deathstalker II"). You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and reappears when Wynorski raises full scenes of "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep". Wynorski used this deception, fourteen years before, in his horrible version of "Not of This Earth". <br /> <br /> Strike Three (you out): <br /> <br /> While Cheacleader Massacre does, I have some nudity (the 40-year-olds who play teenagers and the thickest set of breasts false ones I've seen in a horror movie, ugh), the murders are relatively bloody. What is this all about? The film is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen murders, in my opinion, do not add up to a massacre. The story of the "movie" is fairly fair: the invisible killer stalks a lot of cheerleaders (old girls playing teenagers) until the van runs out of gas. and the "girls" are forced to hold up in an isolated two-story mountain house. I will not ruin the ending for you, but this is one of those "movies" where the person who is obviously the killer is obviously not the murderer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it was filmed in a movie, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. In its place, it is a parody of Jim Wynorski that has no effects, filmed on video. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I beg you, please, do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, more of this video junk without talent will produce. Go out and rent "The Prowler," "The Last House on Dead End Street," "Delirium," or "The Burning" instead. You'll be glad you did it.
