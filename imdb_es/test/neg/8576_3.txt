The surprise presentation of this week in GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (The Nun). Seriously, I think horror films should try to create more imaginative titles, even if the story is about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have splits like The Monk, The Priest and others belonging to several religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very simple, that a ghoul dressed in a nun's outfit (so he can claim the title) goes around killing ex-girls from the convent. There seemed to be some kind of conspiracy involved, as the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by the Icelandic Anita Briem), continues to discover, with the help of some good friends, as a scam. I know what you did last summer (also mentioned, by the way). <br /> <br /> So as the number of bodies increases, it's a race against time for our emotionally marked heroine (is not that always the case?) Discover the truth and save the day. Deepening the sins of mothers, the film did the unthinkable, with a sequence of dreams as an introduction. I hate dream sequences since it is a fairly cheap technique if it is not done correctly, and there are a couple of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> In part, the movie is played at times like Ju-On that went wrong with the A Lot of Dark Water references, and could have renamed this Unholy Water, due to the circumstances and the points of the plot of the movie. However, the holes in the plot abound, so do not look too hard at the story. You would expect the standard textbook twists to the end about the sadistic nun, and sets that look like they can rival the recent Thai horror movie, Dorm. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect English with a lot of accent. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story should be woven into a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt. What gives? Hello, I have hantu, still have humor ah? On the other hand, the ghoul is a fairly cheap animated / SFX that has an incorporated AI to appear from time to time, in various ways, only to provoke shouts from timid audiences. The characters also break all the rules not written in the Do-Nots in the tradition of horror, so you know and expect their just desserts. <br /> <br /> Could you enjoy this movie? Surely it can. Just make sure you're seeing it in a full house (it should be easy, since local people are dumb for something that is remotely awful), and laugh at those who are so nervous that they scream in every "scary" scene. It's quite fun, and adds to the atmosphere, as well as what's happening on the screen. The surround sound is not even close. <br /> <br /> Think of it like watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the jokes, and it's a shame that the bloody moments of the movie have been censored to get a PG rating. It is possible that those were the best parts, now they rot on the board of the censor's floor.
