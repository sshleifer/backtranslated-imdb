I've seen tons of garbage, in every language, on every subject and every movie-making trend. Of each period, each director and any type of available budget. That said, I really have to declare: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's terribly bad. It is pompous It is gloomy It is incomprehensible. It is annoying. It's a really bad mess. It's a piece of what you know. <br /> <br /> And, what is more important: it lacks a point. And even if you had one, the characters are so unrealistic and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion in the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It is strange for the simple fact of being strange. <br /> <br /> I actually felt sick seeing this garbage. The theater where I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. In the end, half of the audience was gone. There was a question and answer session scheduled at the end, but nobody stayed. With the exception of about two patients, all the others ran to the door, myself included. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. Probably one of the worst that has been done. <br /> <br /> If there is a cinema in hell, this movie will be played 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for all eternity
