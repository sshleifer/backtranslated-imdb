I got this movie in a bargain boat, waiting for a funny movie. Chico was disappointed. (except avon). You see, the movie is really horrible, but so horrible, it's not even ridiculous. The plot, oh wait, there's no plot. I guess you could say that it is the main character that rises in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors decided not to make more sense or, more likely, they died and they had a monkey that finished directing the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE END TO BE LEFT! Although the end really does not spoil anything. The main character somehow ends up in a room full of mirrors, in the style of Enter The Dragon, and then gets really angry, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor of this movie was the Avon scene. He is talking to the rival leader of the street fight and says something like that, completely expressionless: "Do not worry about him anymore, sir, I killed him in a sophisticated way, I killed him, I dined and went to a nightclub. And then I killed him. " At that point the boss says "good job, avon, you are number 1". And avon says "Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues and avon continues saying "Alllrriiiight!" and again. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Smart? I think not. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have the "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means that the title of the box I have is "Homeboy". It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. This never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note: I am new to this revision, but hell, yes, I will continue like this.
