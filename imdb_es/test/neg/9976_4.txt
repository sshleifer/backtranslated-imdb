Giallo-fanatics companions: care and / or proceed with caution? For this movie it is not exactly what it seems to be. Surely it looks like a Giallo, with its juicy cover of VHS (showing a naked and busty girl and a big bloody knife), a rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip and Fernando Rey), but basically it's just an erotic thriller without much argument. Is the version I saw presumably severely censored? With an execution time of just 77 minutes? but then there is still a great lack of suspense, character development and, above all, a sadistic killing (and typically of Giallo). "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be briefly summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended description of their sexuality problems. However, it is an interesting effort, because the writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and unfortunately docile. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Back Window," the main character is an elderly, wheelchair-frustrated writer. He and his much younger lover receive their sexual kicks when spying on the only tenant who lives on the street. The tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises in the house while he is naked and clearly has bisexual desires. Wheelchair type sends his wife and they have sex. Then there's Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there normal characters in the story? Well, no, of course not! The film benefits from a continually ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and an ingenious photograph, but none of them leads anywhere, so everything is sordid and unimportant sex. There is a truly strange twist / revelation at the end of the story, but it arrives too late and randomly to improve the overall quality. Not recommended to fans of Italian horror / cult movies, but perhaps an excellent visualization for psychology students, to analyze characters in the Freud style.
