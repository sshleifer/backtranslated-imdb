I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did not finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst crap I have ever seen in my life. What were you thinking about taking three hours out of this? It may have a pretty good story, but the actors? Do not Suspend No. Romance? No. Horror? No. I did not have anything. <br /> <br /> He has this strange and crazy scientist with Einstein's hair, the classic. It is not real at all. And a man keeps getting younger all the time. It seems that they only used the name of Stephen King to make a film that is too long and nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "1 (horrible)". If they had like -5, it would probably take that instead. It was a total waste of time.
