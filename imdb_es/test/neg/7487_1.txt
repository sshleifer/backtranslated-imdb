I thought this was an extremely bad movie. The whole time I was watching this movie, I could not help but think again and again how bad it is, and how that was $ 3.69 down the drain. The plot was so nervous. They did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who was dating who in high school, but they never explained anything after that. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself, because they did not see the need to explain. Basically I understood what happened, I think. What confused me was all of the above, what was the deal with the bloody noses, the phone calls, etc.? Was this boy coming back? Was the wife channeling "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly will not after watching this movie.
