This is one of the most unromantic movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Cast: Richard Gere is already too old in search of romantic roles. Diane is a little anxious to please and frowns as usual, but does not seem convinced by the romance itself. Support cast not very memorable. <br /> <br /> History: The medical drama you have to deal with is not convincing and is not interesting. The story is weak: it does not happen enough to make a movie. There is nothing new to say or any new way of saying it here. <br /> <br /> The setting is a bit bleak and the house in which it is set is not attractive. <br /> <br /> NOT meant to be a great memory.
