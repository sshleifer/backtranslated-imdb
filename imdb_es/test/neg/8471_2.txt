I saw this cooking program a few times before wanting to get my hair done. Just one question ... Who CAN NOT cook a simple and slapped food in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already packed, sometimes pre-cut and you have very little else to do except cut some vegetables? In addition, almost all cooking shows on television last 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all their preparation work (except Sandra Lee) during their program. Oh, and yes ... they also make full meals. <br /> <br /> I love the comment from the guy who hated the "EVOO" comment. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious ... a noisy and sociable woman who is truly your best audience. She laughs at her own boring comments, takes them too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she is as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> NO she is not "the cutest thing". She is a woman of 40 years or more who is not DE-LISH.
