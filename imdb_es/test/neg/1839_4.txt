This "minor piece" of Hong Kong, relatively dark, is the movie of the desert island perfect for video games of the era of video (at least its first half is). Each setting, each scene, each sequence is an excuse to look for a girl's skirt, look at her breasts, look at her ass and look at her narrow crotch. What is establishing are the perverted tendencies of the main character, of course (!) <br /> <br /> Unconditional gender Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic fantasies and extravagant fantasies. All involve sexy Chinese ladies with little clothing, with nothing more than sexual servitude in their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened by a homicidal side plot, voodoo doll bias and a bit of rape and looting. /> Some of the sex scenes are quite hot and the gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced in the second half are half-hearted and the plot developments are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Clearly, shrill garbage producer Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to enter and leave the cinemas. <br /> <br /> The sequence of artistic titles did not deceive this grumpy player.
