** Possible spoilers ** Three young men on the wrong side of the law have the opportunity to change their lives and become useful members of society by becoming covert policemen in 'The Mod Squad', a resurrection of the hit television series of the 60s, directed by Scott Silver. Given their less stellar background, and because of who they are already the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go to places where other cops can not, for what they are named by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a sordid nightclub suspected of being the front of a prostitution ring. For starters, Julie gets a job there as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just "hang out" to find out what they can do. Julie is quickly reunited with an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who seems to be involved with drugs, which are related to the shady deals that occur in the bar. Before it is over, the "squadron" is in its position up to its neck, at the same time as it faces a group of mistaken police officers who are also involved with drugs, and therefore are related to their investigation. Since the beginning of the movie, there is a feeling that you are late; as if it is assumed that you know what is happening to the origin and operation of the equipment. All you get here is a brief biography of the three who give you nothing but a look at their past; There is nothing about how all this really happened. Probably, the thought was that doing it this way would lead to the story faster and make things move forward. While this is true to some extent, some additional background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting; the way it was done here simply depreciates the credibility of the entire process. For starters, the plot is marginal, and any time spent on character development would be worth it. What is delivered, and very unimaginative, is an unconvincing story full of one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors do not receive help from the script, nor apparently from Silver; Danes, Ribisi and Epps come to give life to Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time assigned to them, combined with the lack of support, they still can not give life to these people. Farina, a good actor who deserves something better than what he gets here, is nothing more than a caricature of the "good policeman". There is a feeling that everything took a step in this movie; some details and nuances would have boosted the stock considerably in this case. The cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like that; Much more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie. As it is, it appears as badly conceived and poorly executed. Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like the Major Leagues, who got stuck playing for all the marbles in the local sandbox; Instead of getting an opportunity for the title, they all went dry. As Terry says in "On The Waterfront," "You were my brother, Charlie, you should have been taking care of me." Well, it's obvious that there was not a Charlie to take care of them here, and after 'The Mod Squad', everyone can expect something better to come next time. I rate this one 1/10.
