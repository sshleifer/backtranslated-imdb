This movie is a comedy without sense / parody, in the lines of The Airplane or Naked Gun, but it does not even come close to these two, because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes, instead of just throwing yourself with the same old jokes easy <br /> <br /> You can find out some references to other movies, from the top of my head, I identified Dodgeball and Rocky, so you can have fun with that, trying to figure out which movies are spoofed. <br /> <br /> The movie also offers an occasional laugh, but nothing that can cause injuries, therefore, is not really funny. <br /> <br /> I liked the IPod character in some way (even though some of the jokes with him are standard 101 comedy). <br /> <br /> I think this movie (and like most comedies without meaning / parody) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh For any joke watch this movie . If you're in a good mood, forget about this (re) watch The Airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh.
