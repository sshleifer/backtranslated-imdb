As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three squirrel squirrels just does not seem to have enough meat to hold for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour of this movie was worth seeing. It was fun, I had some laughs, I was full of energy. So somehow I just lost that. I would not even say it vanished, because I thought it was pretty abrupt. The fun was gone; The laughter disappeared. My daughter also noticed it. She is 4 years old, she laughed out loud several times in the first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. Maybe it took a too serious tone: the evil movie producer who killed the squirrels. Something happened, anyway, and it was not for the better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is trying to tell the story of how the squirrels started (Alvin, Simon and Theodore). Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and how they started. The film is up to date, although its true origin is noted in the direction of Dave in 1958, which was the year in which animated rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job since Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be frank, and I could not understand the point of the character of Claire, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can watch with the kids; In fact, it is probably a movie that you would only want to see with the children. He gets a 4/10 of me.
