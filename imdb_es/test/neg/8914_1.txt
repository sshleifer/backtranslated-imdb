TDY is probably the worst piece of junk that has ever played directly in the selection of videos. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this makes me angry because Van Damme is personally one of the favorites for the B movie comedy. Segal has done a good job in the past, but he has fallen very low in my books and probably will never get another one of the guards or marked for death unless he feels and has a very good brainstorming session with himself. <br /> <br /> It also bothers me that he has not done many of his own stunts as he has in previous films. In conclusion of all this, if you are prepared to see a film worthy of a trash can or a woodcutter, then rent today to die.
