Couple having financial problems receives a box delivered to their door. If they press the button, they receive a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. Do you press the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie based on a story by Richard Matheson that has some chills, but above all it is a messy affair. The problem is that there are so many things that feel as if the director of screenwriter Richard Kelly did not know what kind of movie he was making. Is this a direct horror movie with supernatural nuances? Sometimes it seems that we are talking about moral choices, condemnation and the future life. It's a science fiction movie? Possibly, there are many questions about that Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have in a great conspiracy? Is this Invasion of body thieves or a demonic take on a movie? Maybe not. And that is the problem, there are many questions, most intriguing, but there are too many. It seems that little has been explained and, when we reach the end of the film, things seem to stop rather than conclude (even openly). I'm in favor of making a movie rich in themes and points, but writer Kelly fills his script simply with too many that director Kelly can not handle, or he does it in such a way that each plot or plot of the plot gets its ten minutes of screen time and during those minutes it remains on the court before being discarded in the next bit. It drove me crazy (I will not go into the two tracks, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are not very good or probably do not know what to do with the material that is always changing) <br /> <br /> It's a striking mix that does not work (ultimately there are too many holes). I reached the end and suddenly I realized that I had no idea what I had just seen. I really did not like it, but it's more, this is not good because it just gets lost somehow. I would take a pass or wait for the cable where it will not cost anything
