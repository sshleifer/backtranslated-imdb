I laughed twice to see this movie and in case you were wondering, I did not have a bad day nor was I subjected to anything else that could have altered my opinion when watching this film movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I could not. With all this talent, you would think that this would have been at least visible, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play Suck and Not Suck! John Travolta- Very nice. Although obviously buried under too much makeup, I found it nice to see it. It did not stink. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman- After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. The great moment of this character was to show someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn: The death role of a white man who thinks he is black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered fun? I love the boy but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like I was dragging my feet. Sucked <br /> <br /> Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is good. He delivers a great monologue after being called a racial insult (you can probably guess what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. It was fun and it really raised the material that was given to him just by his presence. It did not stink. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel- Sucked due to a telephone presentation. <br /> <br /> James Woods- Sucked but it's not his fault. Actually, it was. It reminded me of your role in Casino for some reason. I do not like the maniac James Woods, I like to burn slow James Woods. Victim of bad writing, maybe? Andre 3000- Sucked but went down swing. I think he has potential, as long as he is not being hacked into his next photo. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian: She is absolutely beautiful and obviously talented, but this movie will not make her a star. It did not stink, but it needs a better vehicle for its talent that is not run by a hacker. <br /> <br /> The Rock - This should have been the role that catapulted him to cinematic stardom, but as F. Gary Gray pointed out, he ends up sadly mishandled. In this film, The Rock projects this charisma that makes it so pleasant that I ended up feeling sorry for him. He tries hard and, although he does not achieve it completely, he gets an A + for my effort. This guy is not afraid to be ashamed and go completely against the guy, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom. I really want to see it big. He has what it takes, as long as he is not being led by a hack. <br /> <br /> What brings me to what I feel is the weak link in this production. I could go out and say it, right? The direction of F. Gary Gray was as solid as really serious diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the brilliant idea of ​​letting this guy lead? The negotiator was good, but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between your address and the atrocious writing, I am willing to help the two culprits get a good lead salad on their knees. Do you want to see John and Uma dance? I might be able to think of another movie with those two that I might recommend watching instead. It's not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents that cost me to enter the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been fine and it was not even "just okay". <br /> <br /> QUALIFICATION: * of *****. <br /> <br /> PS Fergie of Black Eyed Peas is worth mentioning. Glowing!
