My father insisted that I should watch this movie with him and I regret having wasted my time watching. I want you to give me back that hour and a half approximately! The little "funny" movie concerns the elderly Don Ameche who stays with his son, Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgetful" as he's been told, but he also has dementia (it's very similar to Alzheimer's disease). And, as Dad "goes out to lunch" so often, he gets into so much trouble over and over again, almost like the adorable kid on BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is a fantasy and that the baby will be fine. Also, you are not laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness. But, in this case, they are encouraging you to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind ... And where is the humor in that ?! If this film had been more successful, would producers have made movies mocking or people with cerebral palsy or a virus that feeds on meat? There are many people who should have felt ashamed for having made this movie.
