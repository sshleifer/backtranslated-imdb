I like JAG. It has its charm, but lately it has a lot of propaganda. For a stranger (a non-American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I do not like that Rabb and MacKenzie stop being lawyers (as they were in the first parts of the TV show) to become superheroes that stops wars and rescues whole continents. It's almost like watching a recruitment video of the US Army. UU <br /> <br /> I keep watching the show, so it's not that bad. But I would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and do not save the world in the future.
