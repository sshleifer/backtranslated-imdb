First of all, I'm surprised to see that this movie has a rating of 7 on this site. At first, I thought that it could be industry people who log in to IMDb and increase the rating. but after looking at rotten tomatoes and seeing that this movie has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe people have just been tricked again to confuse pretentious shit with depth. I mean, this movie is just horrible. The acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the movie is worse. At least the performance provides some (involuntary) laughter. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a teenage skate boy who is being interrogated along with his friends for a murder in a skate park. and that's it. the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible performance, the terrible dialogue, the slow-motion shots of the people who walk, the faces of the people, the people who skate, often with music that does not fit into the scene. Maybe that was done to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe it was done with the hope of tricking people into thinking it's something deep, but it does not work. Nothing in this movie works. It's pretentious trash. I can not recommend it enough.
