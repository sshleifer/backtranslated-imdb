Someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between "presenting multiple turns" and "screwing the audience". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover the holes in the plot; when they can not find their way in or out of a scene, they just say "she is going back to her past now" or "she is coming out of that now", and they think that explains everything. This movie is a dishonest cheater and in the last 20 minutes it becomes a fiasco in every rule. (* 1/2)
