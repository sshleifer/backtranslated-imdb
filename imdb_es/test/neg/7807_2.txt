Another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood can not even do the basics when it comes to making movies that he used to do while sleeping for decades. If the writer / director had a brain, they would have based the film on the character of Stamp of the tyrant chief Jack Taylor. When it's in the film from the beginning it's nothing special, but it's promising and occasionally fun. Once he leaves for most of the film and Kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures at home with a guest after a bored guest passes by, the movie disintegrates completely. Passable timewaster becomes a stinky inept.
