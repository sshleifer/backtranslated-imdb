There's something wrong with this movie, and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his really horrible situation. Sampedro, like many of those who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that I have been contemplating it for more than 26 years will probably make your condition worse, but the belief that we should do what someone asks of us, even if it means ending a life, in my opinion is deeply wrong. What a contrast to the edifying example of scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a much worse condition for much longer! However, with morality upside down, the film delights in the worship of heroes and the people with whom they disagree are painted in simplistic idioms. There is little room for subtly, especially in the encounter with the priest (deliberately manipulating the real-life encounter with a much younger priest). That way, I guess the movie is on par with Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to take their own lives, when they feel that they can no longer live it. It does not matter if you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who believe you have the right to choose. It is likely that the same people advocate abortion. It's all part of the current tendency to expose those who suffer or suffer, to brush it under the carpet, Mommy will say what it is. OK, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. So we go down the slippery path of believing that some lives are not worth it, and then we will decide that, as some people can not really decide for themselves, we will bring the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from that other Oscar nominee "der Untergang". Hitler, of course, believes that he is carrying out exactly what Nature does to get rid of the weak. Under his regime, there were forced abortions among the weaker "strains," the mentally disabled were silently withdrawn and the Jews were liquidated "humanely" by the use of gas. I would have applauded this film, and why not because it is in line with its philosophy ... "Some lives are simply not worth it". I differ from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in making this film. Human life is sacred, it is not a right, it is a gift and an obligation. Nobody chooses to be born. So who can choose death? It's not about religion, it's about protecting the weak and helpless, something that this film does a lot to undermine!
