Now I have suffered through Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> Having the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to the real horror. <br /> <br /> The story is about a cloning center owned by "The Man". Clones are grown to extract organs from the clones later for the original humans who need transplants. A clone escapes. The government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story somehow leaks out anyway. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see how a movie with potential is destroyed by fans like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was weave the concept of human rights and the philosophical aspect, which makes a human being human, and would it be well to cultivate clones for organic collection? Regrettably, the mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left the city, until the end, where a pathetic attempt is made to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What bothered me most was the introduction of new characters that lack real relevance to the plot. Despite that, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The scenario was interesting. The way Fiveson thought that drawing sheets of plastic and water over them would make a credible river surpass me, but I suppose if I compared the configuration with Coleman Francis gray pasty oatmeal, this film would win. br /> <br /> Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10
