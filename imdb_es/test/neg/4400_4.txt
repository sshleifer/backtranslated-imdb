The situation of the Palestinians is fertile and, until now, it is largely fallow for the making of films. The 'Divine Intervention' strives hard and offers us an insightful view of the almost surreal life of those who are trapped in problems, but the film is nothing more than a bunch of visual jokes (certainly charming) thrown at the celluloid, while the links between them get darker and darker as the film progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent on a very topical issue.
