This film is absolute garbage and it gets even worse towards the end, very long! <br /> <br /> The plot is confusing and laborious, the actors have an attitude that they do not care about (maybe they were paid in advance, a bad move, or they knew they were not going to charge), and the sets They had no features, they were boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to bother with the last 5 minutes, since I assumed that the actors would have fallen asleep by then. More unrecoverable life time! <br /> <br /> If you must see it, take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once. But maybe you need an antidepressant! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's good if the celluloid degrades.
