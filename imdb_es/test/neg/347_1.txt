I saw this movie only because I had the impression that I was going to be treated to a corny horror movie. I mean, look at the line on the label: "They are men turned upside down! And worse yet ... they are still alive!" Does not that shout you corny horror movie? And then there's the title itself: "Screamers." What a perfect title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I was not aware that the real title was translated correctly, "The Fishermen's Island." <br /> <br /> Then, about an hour after seeing this, I realized that it was not a corny horror movie at all ... it was a cheesy "adventure" story about muddy fish men from the Atlantis "Men turned inside out"? No. There was nothing like that. I was disappointed enormously. <br /> <br /> Damn, deceptive slogans! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!
