Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the kind of Pre-Code movie that could incorrectly convince the viewer that the movies of this period of time are terrible, and they are NOT, it's just that this particular movie is horrible. Horrible because while the film tries to be "modern" and "adult", it is also so outdated, boring and boring that I broke up laughing at the movie or just falling asleep! This is a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> So, why, exactly, did I hate it so much? Well, the movie is incredibly sordid but it has no style and the film is bound to have an impact, but it lacks subtlety and gives too many ridiculous twists to be credible. The film begins with a clich√©: a whore with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and seems to accidentally kill a man! Shortly after escaping, she meets an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her (he does not realize his profession). Seeing the innate kindness of this man, she decides to change her life and stop living the wild life. This is difficult when hiding in a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for her man to return, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super-horny and totally unpleasant men. In fact, this part of the movie is so boring, that the audience may have a hard time staying focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of Mackaill that they seem perpetually about to rape her, only to be rejected because she is no longer that kind of girl. Frankly, I got really tired of all these sad scenes: there are just too many eyes and the tongue moves to make it seem more than a very bad movie. And look at all these ugly horns was just annoying and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, ... it gets much worse. The man she thought he killed appears on this little island (what are the odds ?!) and he also tries to rape her. However, she should not be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her new virtue. While the jury on the island is about to absolve her, she rushes back to court and lies, telling them that she intended to kill the man and that it was premeditated (?) Because even if she is acquitted, she knows that the evil jailer will have her with her when they send her to jail for a gun possession charge. Since the jailer in person gave her the gun to install it, she hurried to enter the court and said that she was guilty, that she seemed very, very foolish. Why did not he simply tell them about the twisted plan of the jailer? Supposedly she did this to preserve her virtue, but to admit that she killed someone so that people think you're a virgin? Then, to avoid a brief prison sentence (and, once again, the threat of rape), she does not consider telling the court that she is trying to force her into a sexually compromised situation (the jailer has promised to rape her). when she is locked up). And, just before they take her to the gallows (to avoid rape), the groom shows up in time to dismiss him and the credits accumulate. <br /> <br /> The impossible situation and coincidences abound. -We go so often that the movie is just silly. Combining this with all the sexual advances, this makes it a bad and sordid film from a movie that will only attract the most diehard fans of the Pre-Code movies. Everyone else, be careful, this is very sticky and silly from beginning to end!
