Very crude, very monotonous, there is no real drama. Why not make a documentary? This is not exactly the passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to watch Chronicles is to listen to the performances. I love Bach's music and it even cost me to sit through the misery of a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) Bach. We do not have much sense of him as an actor, since he has been given so little to do dramatically. Mainly, he walks on purpose or rage outside of several rooms. Bach's life, of course, was not an Errol Flynn movie. In fact, it was quite monotonous and more than a little difficult. This probably means that life is not an excellent candidate for a movie. Music, of course, is another story. I recommend Bach Stations. On the one hand, much more information and some information about music, which is, after all, the reason why Bach interests us in the first place.
