Unfortunately, it seems that the golden times of the elegant Italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. And the original idea of ​​the famous filmmaker Lamberto Bava is another obvious proof of this assumption. <br /> <br /> I felt fortunate to see many films by this prolific director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and Demons). Although not entirely satisfactory, they have never been so boring. <br /> <br /> A suspicion that this new entry to my DVD collection was money thrown to the winds came shortly after the scene of the car accident that showed an awkward and unlikely body position under the folding cart. <br /> <br /> And the shallow feeling grew in the course of the chain of events that was meticulously narrated. <br /> <br /> Stupid dialogues, script without suspense and a total loss of talent from the international cast. The only character that provided a more or less manageable performance was the malicious son of Mark, who played with all the boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the work of Mario's son on all accounts could hardly be acclaimed. I look forward to seeing your House of Advisors, which is expected to be an improvement.
