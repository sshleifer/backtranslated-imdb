My summary refers to the fact that this movie has 1479 votes (only 21 less than to be eligible on the infamous Bottom 100 IMDb list), the 100 films with the lowest rating on the website. With an insignificant score of only 1.8, this would place the movie approximately between number 38 and 46 on the list. Talk about a very doubtful achievement! My score of 3 is not so bad, but it makes the film come much closer to the dreaded list. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's starring the once-cute Aaron Carter, another more Packed and forgettable pop star of the nineties. When he first appeared on the scene, he was a cute boy with some songs that attracted preteens and teens at Radio Disney. His songs, appearance and image were scrupulously prepared and created by marketing people and did the trick, which led to the sale of great albums. Unfortunately, by the year 2005, sales were in decline and Carter had reached his uncomfortable stage in life, something that ALL children of his age have to face over time. To put it bluntly, he is no longer cute in this film and is in a very hard stage of life. I guess he is now a magnificent young man ... but in "Popstar" it is no longer the heartbeat he once was. Here, he is very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his "pop sensation" position. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the movie has some appearances of other ex heartbeats. of the last decades, including the roles of David Cassidy and Leif Garrett, two guys who also know what it is to disappear from the spotlight. Cassidy managed to collect the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke. Hopefully, Carter will take Cassidy in the future and until now, fortunately, he managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many pop idols. I was not very excited about the movie, but I really wish you the best in this department. It's not his fault that he stuck to radio and television from the early to the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this film, Carter does not exactly need to stretch himself: he plays a star of pop. However, despite winning millions and being adored by girls, he does not "have it all". It is quite dense, especially because it has little interest in learning. The problem is so serious that his mother decides not to continue studying at home, which forces him to go to a public school. The problem, however, is that he is quite phobic about taking exams ... and doing the degree at school is difficult. Then, he comes up with the idea of ​​finding a smart girl to date, one who would naturally be forced to help him in school. He chooses the cute but elegant Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends that he really likes it in a sad attempt to make this plan work. <br /> <br /> This plot, by the way, is not bad and could work even if it looks a lot like an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon comedy. Of course, it is predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn your plan and feel hurt. And he will eventually realize that he really cares for her. And at the end of the film, everyone will be forgiven and they will be a real couple. , given the good performance and the competent direction, it could be worth seeing among his teenage followers, since the predictable is not always bad. And, as it turned out, this is NOT exactly where the plot was ... but it was very close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things that I liked about the movie. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nice, their role was quite sweet and it was good to see them again. In addition, Andrew Stevens, star of television appeared in the film in the 1970s. It was nice to see him again, although a part of me hated him, since he looks great after all these years and I look a bit like I'm 45 years old. ! He did a good job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on television, it was, quite logically, quite good. . While his relationship with Jane did not seem very believable, he and Mrs. Austin did their best. The film was not great, but they tried and I think most of the problems with the film were in the newsroom: with a better and less formulaic argument, it could have worked much better. In addition, the whole "test-phobia" angle seemed quite artificial ... and quite insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire star gets anxious taking tests at school? In general, it is not a rotten movie as the current rating would imply, although there is not much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people will probably care less than young people who probably have not heard of him. For them, there is no nostalgia value in the movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett gives Aaron advice. I felt like screaming "do not listen!" but he did not
