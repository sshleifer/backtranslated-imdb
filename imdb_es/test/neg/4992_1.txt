This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. Bored, illogical, terrible. Do not waste a minute of your life to see this shit! I hope the directors do not make any other movie because this movie ruins them. The film seems to have been created in a day or two with some friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 guys). They only use camera in hand. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing can be seen. Many scenes (80% of the movie) are just for conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies in which you can laugh, but this is just bad, it does not make sense to make those movies. Please stop by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Do not make more movies!
