Oh, where the hell should I start? Give a brief summary of the story? No. Or you've already heard it, or do not want to. Either way, it stinks. Like the movie. It turns out that I'm a fan of semi-big horror films, and I must say that this is one of the dumbest and clumsiest films I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story starts too fast without any kind of suspense or accumulation in the least. All those scenes of torture would have been MUCH more effective if we had even given a bit of shit to the characters. Since the first scene in the movie is when the teenagers meet Captain Howdy, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? First of all, they seem stupid to go to a party with a guy they do not even know, and second, we do not even know their damn names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they really have the guts to try to make us feel sympathetic to the captain. How about after it has been "reformed"? PLEASE! He was cheering when he got his just deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved the worst! In addition, we are forced to sit through a misguided sequence that rises directly from "The Silence of the Lambs" (and here it becomes HORRIBLE! Of course it will give them a false address! And even if it had Given the true one, do not you think I would be waiting and not drilling Johnson from a guy up? DELAYED!) <br /> <br /> Then there's the dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is ridiculous or just plain stupid. "The dead are terribly dead, when they are dead"? What kind of shit is that ?! Dee Snider at one point says "knowledge is power". Well, if that's true, this movie has no power at all. <br /> <br /> Then, there are the holes in the plot. Yes, I know that this is a horror movie (well, aspiring horror movie), but damn it! You could drive a truck in these holes! First of all, these have to be the MANY cops I HAVE SEEN! FOREVER!! I mean, dear God, these guys are idiots! Ask for help, idiots! Secondly, how the hell did that giant wall of Captain Howdy's nose fall? Obviously, this drilling expert says "that's the biggest I've seen", but if it's so damn big, how the hell could it have fallen so easily? Capt. Howdy left him at the crime scene because he WANTED to be caught? Surely they did not make it look like he did it. Besides, they would NEVER release Captain Howdy, and I know it for a damn fact. He would be in jail for the rest of his life, and there is no way around this. Much less let him return to his old house where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLUSIVE. <br /> <br /> And now the acting. Dear God, these people were stinking. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this movie. She is prepared and it is incredible. Too bad he barely has a good chance to act on this shit. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then ceases to exist. Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underused and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the madman without any talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I would rather have seen Dee Snider in the role of Alexis Arquette in "Bride of Chucky." It would have been much more fun to see this talentless trick get it with that adorable psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider just sucks. He can not act (one of the least fearsome villains I've seen), he can not write (did he write this damn movie while he slept?), And obviously he's dumber than the damn Jessica Simpson! This movie is just one way for Dee Snider to show all the weird shit he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Either it has been done before or it just was not necessary to do it. I was bored for the whole damn thing. <br /> <br /> The performance sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the rhythm stinks, the special FX sucks, the direction sucks ... basically, this movie stinks. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated suspense / horror film and fails miserably. It does not manage to frighten, shake or disturb in any form, shape or form. This is probably one of the least effective and totally unoriginal films I've seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at any cost. It is not pleasant in the least.
