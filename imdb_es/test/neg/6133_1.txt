Okay, first I must say that I assume that this was created by a group of friends on a limited budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to box office success and my rating would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving it a try, it still violated some basic rules for making movies to the point that both the viewer and the amateur director shrank back. MUCH. <br /> <br /> Think: Blair a witch in a car but REALLY boring. <br /> <br /> Think: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and you registered yourself missing in the park at night for an hour, then have your friends see it. <br /> <br /> The most frightening part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) was at a point where the image recedes and you might think you'll have to look all over SCARY again. <br /> <br /> Putting aside stupidity, this is a very good idea for a low budget movie that allows you to go out and make a movie tonight. But the concept follows a very fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's say it was not really good. There were too many parts where nothing happened. At first, I thought that was the director's plan: you were supposed to feel calm because of a sense of security and then really terrifying things began to happen. But no. <br /> <br /> I kept trying to find good things to say about it (and I had a lot of time to think), and I'll say the music was pretty good. And I have to give credit to the main woman for being alone, scared for a long, long time. But that's it. The actors who played "infected" people seemed to make fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the Bug wearing their Edgar suit from "MIB". Most likely, if for some strange reason you are going to watch this movie, be on DVD or Tivo, so that you can overtake it as long as it is too difficult to expect something to happen. <br /> <br /> Hate I am so critical of something, but at the same time I have seen many similar movies and nothing has been so painful. If they had just cut him off for half an hour and added some fear, he might be decent. Maybe that's the director's cut ...
