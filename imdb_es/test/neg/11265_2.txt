I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the 1980s as a young consummate actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the plot related to the Internet and to see how much higher C. Thomas Howell is; I do not remember seeing it in any movie since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In a few words: what a disappointment. I give an opportunity to some low budget films, but this one began little by little. In the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian man in a chat room. Basically, they stimulate themselves to their own chat, then she insists on knowing the participant in person. She finds him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. The plot deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very rigid. Do not bother to rent it, let alone buy it, even if it is in the $ 1 DVD container. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am really surprised that any of the previous reviewers have given this movie a bad rating.
