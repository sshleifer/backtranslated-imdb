This movie could have been great. It is not in my opinion. The story is fragmented, the editor seems unable to choose between a style of storytelling Guy Ritchie and a more direct. There is a great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very superficial and stereo, I would have liked to see more depth there. It is difficult to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains superficial as a whole. <br /> <br /> The film says that it gives the viewer an insider's view of the British criminal lower class, more particularly the lower class of Essex. Soccer hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroin and violence, a lot of violence. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. In this movie, nobody seems to use their brain, we are looking at a lot of animals in clothes. As I said, there is not much plot and the narration leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you are a man under 30, like gore and hardcore violence and you think it is entertaining, then this is a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that represents real people with a well-developed story, suspense and depth, well ... you can skip this one.
