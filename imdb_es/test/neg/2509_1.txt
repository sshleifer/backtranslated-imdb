I can not believe that I sat through this absolute waste of time. I was too fascinated by the indescribably bad that it was not being able to move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can not take your eyes off a horrible car accident or the rotten corpse of a cow. You can not avoid looking, but then you feel sick and nauseated. <br /> <br /> Let me explain: "Plan 9 from outer space", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. Both are terrible to watch, of course, but both have SOME qualities and at least they give you the strength to reach the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (just name) of the science fiction classic left me crying on my couch, desperately trying to come to an agreement with the reason why these scripts are filmed, why someone It would stain the memory of the original classic, and whether or not it could resume my normal life without me. Suddenly, I acquired a longing for the tranquility and peace of death. <br /> <br /> Although I realized that death would offer no respite from the horrible memories of this pile of garbage, as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to observe again and again for eternity ...
