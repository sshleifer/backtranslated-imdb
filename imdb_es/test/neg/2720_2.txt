It seems that I am in the minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty horrible. It seemed to contain almost all the clich√©s in this kind of "moving" films. <br /> <br /> The motivation of the characters who fall in love with the Radio was never really explained. We were supposed to accept that everyone liked the radio, except for a couple of bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost all the great moments of the story from a distance of 100 meters. When the movie wanted you to be "Awww" or you would take out your handkerchief, I was rolling my eyes and wished I was watching "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> There were some good performances by the cast. Too bad they have not been given a better movie to appear.
