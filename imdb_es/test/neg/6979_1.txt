I supported this movie just to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever presented. I am surprised that this film currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. The acting is horrible, the script does not exist and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny movie I can not even remember to laugh once and I do not see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay well away from this scum and check out some more valuable alternatives that would give you much more pleasure. Take a look at movies like the holidays or the 27 dresses, these films would offer a much more satisfying cinematic experience. I sincerely hope that the most educated filmmakers will vote negatively for this film, in the way that it really deserves to be given a more realistic rating in which other moviegoers could base their judgment. Come on, friends, let's be fair to all concerned and give those involved in this film a true reflection on what they have produced, an extremely mediocre image that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
