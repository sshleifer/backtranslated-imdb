I'm a dance teacher and I expected some good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals face is very young, sweet and innocent, and this is very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing disturbance, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the tantrums of a small child. It is very hard to believe that Nick would come back with such a bad-tempered teenager after his frequent rantings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and throws a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home, in the middle of the highway - with only one shoe !!! And what happens after his idiotic behavior after the night in the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing: the 30-year-old man who goes after a girl who seems to be 16 years old. <br /> <br /> As for the dance, I'm afraid that this style of the 80s is totally outdated. What the hell was that dance sequence in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I was not even sure if it was a woman or a man who was dragging! And even that famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of your jump really ruin its effect because you can not see what it is doing. And what the hell was she doing when she passed in front of each of the panels that pointed to them? And as many other comments have pointed out, I would NEVER enter a ballet company because of the strength of that audition; Maybe that's why they do not say at the end whether they succeeded or not, the closure is the fact that they overcame their fear at the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought that the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is, of course, if you can overcome her hideous disguise and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good fragments in this movie: the ballet dancers stretch out when Alex shows up for the first time to request an audition: they look so charming and classy, ​​and at least this helps to underline the difference. between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was break dancing on the street. I also liked the parents of the ice skater, they were fun. <br /> <br /> Some other random points: who was Hanna and how did Alex meet her? What was an 18-year-old doing living in a converted warehouse alone? How could he afford that lovely bar and all the furniture? Where was your family? Was that scene in the 'naked' club really necessary? The person who wrote in his comment that it was something like a Disney movie needs to have his head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /> <br /> Many people said that the movie was bad, but they liked the message: do not lose hope, keep trying and your dreams will come true. See "The Little Mermaid" instead.
