This movie is an obvious scam by Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You must invest a couple of hours and look at the original. I discovered that it was disjointed and difficult to follow, with many scenes that did not make much sense. I am not opposed to the violence in the movies, but all this seemed to be no more than an excuse to make one person disappear after another, many of which were slightly related to the story. With all the others killed, throughout the film I wondered why Frank did not just blow Johnny's brains out. He certainly could have done it and Johnny did not act as someone who could be trusted. Another thing that bothers me are the sex scenes; Why do these people have sex with their clothes on? Is that supposed to turn us on? Surely they did not think they had a chance in a PG ranking. Nothing in this movie seemed to work naturally. As if you were observing people in real life, instead, it was done in a superficial and hard-line manner.
