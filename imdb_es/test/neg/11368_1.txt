This was the worst television movie I had seen in my life. The images were so jumped that they made me dizzy. I hated the constant approach and distance, and the frequent change from black and white to color. I also thought that the story did not make any sense, and it was another clich√© action movie, with a hero a bad guy and some hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can keep it firm, something the director could not do. In truth, the worst I've seen, did you think Disney was bad? I did not even bother to see everything because I'm sure I could guess the result, and the visual was the worst I've ever seen.
