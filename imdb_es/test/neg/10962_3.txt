This movie was horrible, especially considering the work that must have been done in its production. Although it's not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's pretty horrible. Keep in mind the obvious deceptions of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This heterogeneous mixture of horrible makeup and wooden acting. <br /> <br /> The movie starts like most zombie movies nowadays. A montage of interesting cuts and a radio transmission of the bud in question. We see our hero (Ryn, possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in the modern era, counted four or five times in which he scratched his head with the barrel of his gun or looked at the barrel while blowing) by cutting the fingers of the zombies Later we learn that these fingers are collected to obtain rewards. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing zombies; going so far as to buy chum * panting * from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speaks with a strange Middle Eastern accent). While Ryn uses the friend to collect a bountiful reward from Lost Hills, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And they realize how horrible the movie is. The zombies come together badly. I have seen comments praising her makeup, but in my opinion she was quite amateur. Obvious Halloween stickers were used to make zombie faces and there were stitches where a girl seemed to be wearing a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To summarize the following sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is again stabbed by Hans (who made a deal with other zombie hunters, Blythe is the leader), gives him a casual second, returns to be stabbed by Hans, then he shoots Hans and arrives in Union City, where he finds that Blythe is poisoning the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> That's really in regards to the plot. When Ryn arrives in Union City, all the bad guys get together in a house that evidently is so massive that Ryn takes hours to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of those cynics "are you going to kill yourself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * FINAL SPOILERS * I'm going to have to blame Nott for most of this disaster. The address was horrible. EVERY character showed a frown that was not Hans, who was easily the best "actor" in this group of rejects from MacBeth. When they arrive in Union City, a horde of zombies attacks the crew and, obviously, the zombies were given no advice or ideas on how to walk as if their appendages were rotten. A woman swings as if she were swimming in the air on a Sunday walk. <br /> <br /> Some movies are horrible. This movie is one of them simply for the fact that logic seemed abandoned to keep a story in motion. It works occasionally, but in this sense (where the story was already in ruins), it does not. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.
