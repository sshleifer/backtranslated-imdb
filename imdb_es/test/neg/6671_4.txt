The last protagonist vehicle of Norman Wisdom was a departure from his previous exits. upgrade your accident-prone milquetoast, this being a product of Swinging Sixties! The end result is an uncomfortable and sometimes embarrassing comedy that mixes the typical slap (and sentimentality) of the star with a moderate sexuality and even a softer satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip to a bank conference that falls in love with teenage Sally Geeson (who does not mind getting involved with him, but does not take her relationship so seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of his capricious nature. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have it and, in any case, it's interesting for his mid-life crisis treatment (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [ 1970] and 10 [1979] - both, incidentally, I have only seen them); Towards the end, Norman even tries to take his wife to his new way of thinking! The Pretty Things appear as if they were playing a lot of melodies in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy song of the title!
