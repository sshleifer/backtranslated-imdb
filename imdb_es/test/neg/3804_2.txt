... but other than that, there is almost no redeeming social value in this sequel to the original Poseidon Adventure. Where the hell are all the people in the original, including the rescue team? Michael Caine submits to his most humiliating performance to date (although he later prevails with Jaws 4 on the way). Slim Pickens is simply embarrassing as a stereotypical Texas, and in general you should just ask yourself: "Why did you get upset?" The last stab of Irwin Allen to take advantage of the disaster madness, I suppose.
