Another version of the mother of all the gangster films: the classic "Godfather" and another case of exaggeration due to the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindu film by Ram Gopal Varma as director, is also the weakest in his trilogy of the Underworld, including the other two as the excellent Satya and Company. The Charism, the magnetic person of the two Bachchans who play the father-son duo on the screen for the first time, is definitely a delight to be reckoned with. Not only the good results, but its perfect chemistry is the point of highest score here for which Varma should be applauded. However, the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. Reason: the other characters are more like cardboard caricatures esp. The villains represent the bad guys typical of Bollywood. A character that attracts attention is the eldest son played by Kaykay, but again can not be maintained due to the characterization halfway. . Drama and conflict come to life through the excessive use of close-shots, which brought the claustrophobic effect needed to build an environment. The unforgettable score (Amar Mohile) and the sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani and Anup Dev), together with a dark and dark background are superimposed with powerful and brilliant images (camera work by Amit Roy) contribute to the aspects so typical of Ramu's style. But there is an excessive use of music, although fortunately there are no songs in the film. But can the interest of today's "smart growth" audience be sustained only by the shoulders of two strong visual artists? I do not think so. Surely, the audience "maangey more" and here the film is not delivered. In any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the most important prerequisite is the Script, which in this case is slow and is not clear in some places and, therefore, the rhythm decreases quite frequently. What the audience finally submits to is a very predictable drama, very common, with very few surprise elements. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not at his best. Some scenes that require a different treatment include: a minister is speaking badly of Sarkar and the son is listening by chance; Sarkar Jr., a very amateur shooting in Sarkar prison, escapes from the clutches of his enemies, a son easily motivated to kill his own father, a son enters secretly in his father's room to kill him, a commissioner Police slap Sarkar Jr. - all this requires a more realistic and forceful approach, which is the backbone to create the required conflict. The dialogues are weak eg. Look at a line of fans where a CM tells Sarkar Jr. ?? "Wo jo Police Commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya" ... The women who take Sarkar's work are completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations over criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also seem a little out of place. In fact, the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's production, Ab Tak Chhappan. When describing the battle between good and evil, the other side of life: law, police, administration, politics is completely ignored. Certainly, more is expected in the content. Here, the film definitely falls short and can not be raised above an average rate. Dear Ramu, you agreed that now that you are laughing at the bank, you should definitely take some drastic revision measures at your movie production factory, before it is too late.
