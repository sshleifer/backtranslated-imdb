It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy who does what he loves, there's an honesty about him that often lacks other microcredit managers. Take a look at the tiny credits of the crew at Camp Blood, it's not at all usual to thank everyone for the pizzeria they ate at, Brad and his friends, and that's it, no pretentious crap. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not her average horror movie heroine, but she's doing so well that she barely notices, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny that it hurts. The Clown is not a bad guy from the original horror movie, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job to bring it to life and the image faces very well with the rural background. Camp Blood is horror like the blue collar and the basic thing it receives, it's not a good thing, it's not a bad thing, just one thing.
