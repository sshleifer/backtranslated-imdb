Something boring, something disgusting, something disturbing, this was not horrible, but not too good. However, when the statue comes to life, there is a good spooky element for this scene. Not much happens, and the movie feels a little frothy. I was happy when it ended, and I do not think this is a real story ... very surprised that there is an average of around 6.
