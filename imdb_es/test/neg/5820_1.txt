Thank God this has not been renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, although popular (God knows why) has a very simple look: "Look, I found another body behind the flowers / shrubs / trees / wherever." they are working, for the sixteenth time the plot of this series. The dialogue is as simple as if this had been written for children: talk to the viewer and explain each point of the plot. <br /> <br /> They simply 'happen' to be around when someone does something out of the ordinary - and nobody notices them. <br /> <br /> Every time they investigate and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else: they ruin everyone's life, including the completely innocent ones. <br /> <br /> They break and enter people's homes, steal items and evidence (including firearms) by being intrusive and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their things. They never apologize, they are never caught or arrested (and if they do, they can talk to get out of that, although another character who does the same thing is put in prison!). <br /> <br /> Triumphs always rise. Now I know that this is an easy series, but I think that in a realistic way I should not have overcome the first episodes! In a nutshell, it is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they have found enough bodies in the brush both here and on the Continent (where they are every two weeks), so I hope it never comes back. <br /> <br /> ITV should have some action on the screen instead of all the years of monotony - 'someone has been killed at the town fair - again' type series.
