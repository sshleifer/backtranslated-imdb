You Belong To Me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan movie for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to obtain the role of Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that, it was usually his loan the movies that were good while he was mediocre at Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule broke down here. Although the character he plays has some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this movie is not so much fun. In fact, feminists would probably be horrified by it. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck herself did not like anything. She liked to work with Henry Fonda, but this movie was ridiculous. I should have done it too. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy, whom we would now call a baby trust fund that really does not do much with his life. It's a kind of adorable lunkhead that meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls in love with her trying to show off. It turns out that she is a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and they get married. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that Fonda has a jealous streak, especially when it involves Roger Clark, another Stanwyck patient millionaire. And he does not understand his professional obligations. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that she should go out to work and live on a salary and see if she can do it, Fonda goes out and gets a job as a saleswoman in a department store. She is so proud of him, that she is really going to abandon her medical practice and live with him with the salary of her salesman. <br /> <br /> Today would be the picket of the movie NOW. Stanwyck did not have much conviction in his performance, probably because she did not believe any of that. I certainly could not. <br /> <br /> I do not think that even then the public would believe it. But the two stars and the rest of the cast did their best, but this was a Thanksgiving special.
