If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the cast did everything possible to maintain the action and interest of the scripts, I began to compare the episodes with the original series. There was an expectation that Steed would be more involved in the fight scenes, and the continuity seemed to be that the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors. To be honest, I can not blame them for trying to resurrect fans of the original series, but it just did not work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted a season. Seeing Steed working on this series reminded me of General Macarthur when he said: "The old soldiers never die, they just vanish!"
