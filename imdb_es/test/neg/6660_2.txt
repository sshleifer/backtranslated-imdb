Words can hardly describe this movie. Loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a stupid plot and poor music, this film is lacking in almost every category. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the IMDB credits. This is not a Michael Dorn movie. It is a secondary character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> Also included in Credit's is an actor named "Prince", which makes me wonder if he is the same artist that used to be known as ... I'm not sure it's worth watching this movie only for that. <br /> <br /> Great summary ... a group of teams ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 ... one has an "Illegal Substance" ... and one has $ 350,000. Add a little confusion and confusion about who needs to know who, to take revenge on being taken, and that, and it will end with this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Given one option, I would let this happen. movie.
