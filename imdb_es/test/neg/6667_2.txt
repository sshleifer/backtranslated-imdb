This film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences in the face of the death of a child and the healing that can finally reach them. <br /> <br /> The family finds out about the death of their son on Christmas Eve 1991, ruining the holiday season for them. They do not celebrate it again for many years. There is an interesting comment from the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation. <br /> <br /> Matthew's character makes a reference to Jesus, but I suspect other comments he makes come from. from non-Christian sources. I wonder if other viewers would recognize those comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data in this movie.
