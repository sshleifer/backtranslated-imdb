This is a pretty useless remake. Beginning with the initial shots of the original's title was a real mistake, as it reminds the viewer what a great cooler of period pieces was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a 'city boy' photographer who returns to a semi-deserted desert town populated by a handful of underdeveloped cliché characters: the palette sucking Daby-Doll Lolita, the 'intriguing explorer' of the coot, the crippled veterinarian and his Asian wife, etc ... <br /> <br /> Kerwin's character witnesses the collision of 'something' on a hillside and shortly afterwards strange things start to happen as pieces of rare blue rock are scattered around. The temperature begins to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people start acting strangely, things explode. The character of Kerwin enters and leaves his car more often than is humanly possible in a movie. The film does not develop the sense of place, the development of the character, humor, tension. Everything that made Jack Arnold's original a small classic of Cold War paranoia has been abandoned. Simply run through your minimum hoops and then finish. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special: the interior of the ship looks like pieces of film wrapped around some strings that then hung in the front. of the camera to frame some of the most boring and clumsy wiring jobs ever put on the screen. The script is repetitive: everyone says everything at least twice, Kerwin says "let's get out of here" at least three times during the film, twice in a scene. A lot of things remain unexplained at the end, why do the aliens need all the heat and water, for example? - It's not that nobody who is watching cares; If the filmmakers did not care, why should we? <br /> <br /> The performance is adequate, better than the script, which sometimes has a poorly rehearsed improvisation quality, it deserves. Although the actors often seem to want to end the thing as quickly as possible, a notable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña registers the briefest and symbolic moment of "frustrated hands of despair to face the gesture" before following the cranky son Stevie outside. to see him do the gesture of "angry sulking teenager breaking something from a table". <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the adhesive label (GB) on the back of the Kerwin jeep that appears and disappears, a double action of the gas in the car exploding, a person from cities in two places simultaneously Once in the Alien Stevie she fired POV and, immediately afterwards, in a reaction shot, Elizabeth Peña seems to close the door of a car twice ... you can see that she was caught, right? The movie makes the biggest mistake. It's boring.
