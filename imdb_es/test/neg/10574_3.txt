And so it began with "Shreik" a horror movie, then we had Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious shipment. however ... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie * and many more (really fun movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... Superhero movie ... it seems that the people who make these films can not yet understand what makes the mailings fun. Using scams from other movies in a fun way is fine if done correctly, but many producers do not seem to know how to do it. Scary Movie (1) did well, the following sequels were horrendous, since they tried to overact the franchise, but they were exchanged for Scary Movie 4. No other movie for teenagers was good because they used the parodies well ... and their credit I'm fed up of movies for teenagers. However, this movie plays like a bad version of all these. it's based on a slap that would make even the three puppets shudder, violating the image of Stephen hawking, and then, when people start to get bored (and the producers knew when that would be), they treat us with Pamela Anderson in a tight suit To the skin. . to conclude, the parodies should consist of making a model of homage to an original film with an original story, not to cover random shots of legitimate films in the history of a real movie. <br /> <br /> ... I shudder to think of "SCI-FI MOVIE" and prepare my seppuku knife
