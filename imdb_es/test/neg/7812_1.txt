To be fair, I could not bear to watch this movie all the time, so I have no idea if it suddenly improves in the middle of the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so are among the worst I've seen in a long time. Children under twelve can feel comfortable with the badly written, acted and directed slapstick humor, but adults who have total control of all their faculties should avoid this stinky.
