I can not believe that I even tried to see this dirt. As an avid fan of the B-Horror movie, he was more than fascinated by the prospect of this movie by popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, from the beginning of the movie, I could not, for my life, think of a movie worse than this one. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the film is prolonged without real horror to talk about. However, I will admit the pure hilarity of a couple of scenes when Dr. Gore is hypnotizing his future victims. The camera focuses on bulbous eyes, too big, while all the time there is a purely putrid soundtrack to add to the fun. I laughed for most of 10 minutes. After erecting his "miraculous wife", the film is lost almost 20 minutes, showing him and his "girlfriend" while he is teaching him to speak, then they talk, play among marigolds, picnics, etc. Unfortunately, there is only playing music during all this fandango without any discourse. This part of the movie will leave you wishing you had cut your wrists with the opaque edge of a butter knife. I almost want to throw up just thinking about this movie. If you like movies that are bad, look at this one.
