I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I saw right after the attack of the killer soldiers 3 and Starship Troopers 2. It was not just the dialogues or the paper walls or even the gun shots that simply disappeared automatically. There are no holes in the walls. It was horrible acting. It's no wonder I've never seen these actors before they've all slept with the director (s). I think I'm being nice to this movie now, but that's just because I'm tired of screaming in the movie (I just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as you can and record them so that no one can ever see this horrible waste of time, money and movies.
