"Tarta" is a good illustration of the old Yogi Berra saying: "If you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up in another place". Writer / director Christina Waye (in her first film) has managed to make a $ 3 million movie that ends elsewhere. "Tart" is a story of coming of age without characters that a rational person can connect, a black comedy without humor or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard Swain movie, "Tart" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the Swain scene in the park, with a nice montage of the sculpture "Alice in Wonderland". The symbolism incorporated in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or tone unit) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Waye tried a fusion of the somewhat metropolitan "metropolitan" and the classic "Cruel Intentions" of the camp, which also deals with Manhattan's upper class. There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors, but few shots of faces and eyes. The previous technique pointed to the symbolism and the second to the intentional distancing of the characters and their motivations. "Tarta" seemed to be about to turn towards the territory of the camp at least twice and it would have been well advised to continue in that direction. First was the scene in which they try to throw the Swain, apparently deceased, to the garbage ramp. Then it's all about his father being a Jew (he played at the same extreme as Joel Gray dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In his other films, Swain's technique of acting consists of overwhelming every scene in which he appears (he inserts the stage chewing here) but in "Tart" he actually shows a capacity to contain himself. This is the best performance of his career. It also provides some clues about his physical deterioration, from super cute and hairy in "Girl" to Hump in the face of "Pumpkin". This transformation was completed almost in half when he made "Tart"; So see the ravages of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense's" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is just horrible, although part of the blame for this must go to the script and direction of Waye.
