It's as if someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene is a mix of things we have to sit with. <br /> <br /> Now let me say how much I love. Chinese fantasy movies. From the fun and the silly, to those who focus on martial arts, to the most dramatic and romantic types, it's a genre that I really enjoy. Movies like "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly and Sword"; "Green snake"; "A history of Chinese ghosts"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain"; "Tiger crouching hidden dragon"; and others. That's why I looked forward to "A Chinese Tall Story". One of the characters in the film is the "Monkey King" (also known as Sun Wukong), a well-known character in Chinese mythology, told for the first time in the stories of "Journey to the West", the epic adventure written about 500 years (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the "Chinese Odyssey" films, among many others). Other family characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So, how is everything going wrong? Well, let's take a familiar example for Western audiences. What about the Robin Hood mythology? A well-known story of yesteryear. Let's say that our Robin Hood movie was starring Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Fray Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie PÃ©rez. Let's also give Uzi to Sir Robin, because you never know when you'll have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They may also need rockets, and while we're at it, give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that surely could be useful. If you think this sounds like a really great narrative of the Robin Hood story, then "A Chinese Tall Story" is the movie for you. As I indicated earlier, this movie is a messy mess. In the first 30 minutes, we are presented not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "demon of the millennium" (who shoots with laser) . Beams), an Underwood Tree God, a tribe of lizards, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Tortoise of the Lord Chancellor, a Sea Dragon King, a magical golden staff in constant transformation, a girl of charlatans, wormholes in space, and Four Heavenly Knights. All this would not be so bad: the stories and myths handed down over the years certainly have all kinds of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not include many of the things that we submit to in the last half of the movie. (Useful tips for filmmakers: the fact that their computer effects guys CAN create attractive-looking spacecraft and representations of intergalactic warfare does not mean they MUST). <br /> <br /> You know that your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I'm not making this up? It's a direct quote from the commentary) "I asked the composer if we can have more rock-and-roll music when she transforms into some kind of Android thing. " Is there a story hidden here somewhere? Yes, there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse "Gen-X Cops", "Time and Tide", "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the girl of the lizard (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing in this movie. You can meet her as half of the singing-pop group "Twins" and other films like "The Twins Effect" (a funny movie) and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, being an impudent lizard and all, is hard to recognize with her warts, hooked teeth, pasty nose and hunched back. That's until the computers take over and embellish it, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is passable, but all support actors were abysmal. A couple of recognizable faces in small parts are wasted. <br /> <br /> At one point, I was debating with myself if "A Chinese Tall Story" was a parody. I could almost convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very nice Fan Bing-Bing) came out and lit a Marlboro (!) While talking with Tripitaka who practiced martial arts dressed in a spider. Costume of man (!!). But it is not a parody. Of course, there is the typical stupidity of Hong Kong, but the film is taken quite seriously, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (recorded with a hammer of evocative violins and cellos) and exciting action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You might think you could see this in a Netflix rental and it would not cost you anything. (Oh, but it will cost you, okay). <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Of course. The colors are vibrant (they are the best of this movie). And the filmmakers were certainly trying hard. Too bad that all that effort has become a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.
