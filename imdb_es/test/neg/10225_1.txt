Take a clich√© story and insert Steve Guttenberg. Do I need to say anything more? This really is as bad as you might expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery try to transform a group of useless and inept children into a winning soccer team. Lacking originality and direction of compensation is a great struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenberg's acting ability, I can safely say that the coach's performance of the opposing teams is actually worse than Guttenberg's. I thought it was unimaginable before. This kind of story of the helpless struggling to the top has been done before and better every time this so called "movie".
