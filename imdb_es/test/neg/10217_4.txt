ALERT: This revision contains the main SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by how many votes you got (my vote was the fifth), very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, by the end of the 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. A federation of women called the Ladies' Professional Wrestling Association was opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I always thought that she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring ability and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWA was closed in the early 90s, so it only seemed natural that someone as talented as Mimi started a career as an actor, right? But surely there was an alternative to things like this? This movie is very bad. As I went along, I kept comparing it to an underrated movie called `Survivor Quest ', only that this movie lacks everything that made' Survivor Quest 'enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the tape, I went to Fast forward through the preview to get to the meat tape. At first, I was not paying much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos. 'Oh', I thought, 'here's another movie that Mimi must be looking for.' But as the preview progressed, I realized it was a preview for "Beyond Fear!" You know you're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning presents the movie you're about to see! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays with a former kickboxer who lives with the guilt of hurting an opponent / friend, so he focuses on his second career he shares with his friend Sammy: being a wildlife guide. On this particular occasion, she gets a troop of three couples. Two of the couples are there to occupy space. You think you will explore a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, since there is a problem between them in the middle of the movie, but it is ignored in favor of the repeated jokes about the bears in the forest, which always scares the the Korean wife The joke is fun the first time you hear it, but it certainly is not for the ninth time they do it. The third couple is simply painful to see: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They swap insults from one side to the other, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he is not busy making cruel jokes with his corpulent wife ... like his typical American partner! Before the walk, Mr. Page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and discovers that Mr. Page recorded it. Thus the danger begins, as the two boys track the group on their journey, and we wait. "And we wait" and "we wait" and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the cast. They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is the director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to re-interpret small parts and stay out of the director's chair. Lyons starts and stops the scenes in such a careless and sudden affair that you start to think that he suffered from dyspepsia during the whole shooting. There is even an incompetent moment when a broad scene of daylight with the bullies slips between some night scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and the background noise completely overcome the dialogue so you have to move your ear next to the speaker of your TV. Do not hit your head on the screen! It's not worth listening to the misspelled lines. Speaking of bad writing, Lesseos gets some credit there as a co-writer. The few interesting developments between the characters are often abandoned for the shots of the thugs or the practical bad jokes. At first, Lesseos hits a thug with a knife, so do not think they're in danger from the two stupid thugs. When the thieves finally get their asses kicked by Lesseos in a long and well-made fight, our cast laughs big time, despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy at the end. All but the poor souls who witnessed the film, wishing the old days of glory when Mimi acted in the wrestling ring. Zantara Score: 4 out of 10.
