I am a big fan of British films in general, but especially of gangster films. Unfortunately this movie was surprisingly bad. I think it's pretty depressing that this movie is getting good reviews from customers. The idea that this movie is harsh and realistic is ridiculous. I have read and heard a lot of information about the real life events that are shown in this movie and almost all have been glorified with the most intense violence, etc. The only real fact in the whole movie was the Range Rover murder in which some exaggerated bouncers were eliminated for messing with people they could not handle. This movie is a disgrace for British cinema! It has no decent argument or acting and only relies on being violent (harsh and realistic as some people like to say). The kind of people who made this movie should not be allowed to be close to a budget or a movie camera, like the class of people. This film should not be given the chance to tell this pathetic and violent story without consequences.
