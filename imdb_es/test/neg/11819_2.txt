And you would be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as 'Women in Chains', is exactly the kind of poor quality b-movie the premise suggests. Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with many other women, and this place makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked now look like a maximum security prison. Five minutes into the movie, one of the handsome guards pronounces the line "Lánzalos" and bórralos, and then we are presented with a prison life that resembles the fantasy of a freshman at the university. It is the interior of a house of brotherhood is like. <br /> <br /> The prisoners soaping and rubbing and fighting each other in the shower as if it were a session of Girls Gone Wild, then everyone gathers in their bedroom, smoking marijuana and discussing in a large group what I know the best way to escape. I have never been in prison, but I have the feeling that escape plans are the kind of things you want as few people as possible to know, prisoners or guards or otherwise. The biggest difference between this life in prison and a life of fantasy brotherhood is that all the women in this movie wear orange cardigans (and no pants, just imagine) PRISON on the back. They should be generic prison suits for prisons that can not afford expensive accessories, such as the name of the prison or the number of prisoners in their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And as you would expect, a prison that can not afford to put the identification of the prisoners on the back of the uniforms obviously can not expect to find guards who are interested in protecting the prisoners as much as they do in having sex with the prisoners and each other. <br /> <br /> The conflict The title of the film refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends most of the time in handcuffs to a blonde prisoner named Karen, as they flee the police after escaping of the prison. I will not go into details about how they escape, except to say that you may have seen something like this in The Fugitive if you could not afford a train, and that leads to the confusing history of conflicting interests that you also pursue. These two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee have their own gangs of people, each with the hope of rescuing their respective escaped prisoners, and the police are chasing them both at all times. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) So Karen is involved with a lot of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to leave the island, something she has been trying to do for years, and it's not just perfect that each of them needs to go to completely opposite sides of the island to meet their goals. So we have this strange couple and, given that they are a strange couple, it is not difficult to predict that they will hate each other for the great majority of the film, but in the end they will face each other. <br /> <br /> In a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect a climactic moment that involves rival gangs at some point in the movie. Not being ready to leave anyone dissatisfied, they throw a stupid gang showdown at the end of the movie, where they all fire machine guns, killing each other en masse as the two women row safely and quietly across the river in a small boat. . Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Even better, at the end of the movie, after a huge massacre in which many people are shot and spit out bright red paint everywhere, the Police Captain looks at the masses of criminal dead covered with terrible, terrible special effects, and we learn that he will be a commander before dinner. It's not a bad way to finish the movie, the criminals kill each other and the police get all the credit, but here's the last line of the movie. "It's better to win, right?" <br /> <br /> Is ESA why the Captain is going to be promoted to Major? Why did you realize that?
