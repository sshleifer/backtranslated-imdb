Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class, our teacher made us see this film and Amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something like that. First we saw Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when he made us see this movie right after that, I could not believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrible, the costumes were ugly (the one of the small children was especially ugly and juvenile), and the cinematography was z-grade. My friend compared it to a home movie without the date in the lower right corner. I understand that this was a television and television movie from Canada and that it probably cost $ 10 to do it, but please, they could have done it better. I have seen some good TV movies in my time, but this was not one of them. The most important thing I do not understand is why my World History class could not see Immortal Beloved or something like that. How is it possible to compare composers when they are given the film Amadeus, for Mozart, and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, for Beethovan? It is not possible to do that when this is the choice of the film for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone is interested to know, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).
