and an abysmal, exaggerated performance, you may enjoy this garbage trap. Apparently, atomic bombs change life in about one or two days (or, according to other viewers, wake them up). Or so it seems. And the seemingly massive atomic explosions off the coast of Spain do not make anyone ask questions. On second thought, the plot does not make any sense at all (why do the evil sock puppets attack the headlights?), So the nuclear weapons that are activated for no reason do not stand out too much. <br /> <br /> Well, overcoming this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing to do in socks in kindergarten, you may be able to stand this. But for once, the complete lack of blood does not help, leaving the monsters attacking in all their naked budget "glory". <br /> <br /> Although I doubt you can see this, so better stay well away.
