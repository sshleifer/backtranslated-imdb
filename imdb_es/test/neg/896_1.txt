Sometimes it's fun to watch movies implode from your couch, but other times it's terribly painful for your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when your eyes and your mind beg you to deactivate the movie. This latest installment of the House Party series is, by far, the worst, not only the sequel, but the movie released by Hollywood. It becomes very evident in this "feature" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day with a passion. I say this because it is very clear that Stokes had no problem removing the originality of Bueller from the hands of John Hughes and decided to create a film completely devoid of humor. You would think that by "stealing" themes and images from a more fun movie, your own movie could at least generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, let alone a Hollywood movie. From his confused and rambling story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and the old / tired recycled clich√© moments, all Stokes is doing is hitting a larger nail in the coffin that houses the House Party films . It reminds me of that student who forgets his project in an hour and quickly puts together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, gum and straws and presents it as "Hannibal Crossing the Alps". It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed by the creator. <br /> <br /> So, where did this movie jump into the world of comic stupidity? Honestly, I do not think most places allow me to talk so much, so I'd like to touch on some of the most important issues that struck me the most. For starters, I still can not shake Ferris Beuller's scam. It was as if the director Stokes was ashamed to have to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to incorporate a completely random formula (from a fun movie) and see if he could cut and paste elements of the original series in that formula. That was a big mistake. When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think we are going in one direction, but instead we turn to another. That is exactly what can be seen in House Party 4. In one case, we have John-John trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" at the same time we try to get a record contract (well, a little reminds me to the original House Party), but then we headed to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, grandma gets drunk and some idiotic moments of mental dullness with a supposed murderer. Again, we started something strong, and we ended up chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to maintain control of humor or to tell a sequential story. He prefers to shorten the angles, keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots that try to revive a series of dead stones. One would think that when a director was given the task of filming another House Party movie, he would come in thinking he or she would revive or revive it, instead, Stokes just wanted to be paid. br /> <br /> I realize that I am slowly getting older as the days go by, but I think I still keep my hand on the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R & B while growing up, but the group "Inmaduro" never reached my cassette or my CD player. Why? I do not think they had any followers, but apparently for director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to choose them as the protagonists of his new House Party movie. Did not anybody in any study realize that this was going to be in red numbers pretty quickly? Or what about the option of Stokes taking charge of the comedian car repairman, nothing like a comical senseless director who becomes the only source of humor possible? It was one of those few cases in which I missed Robin Harris, and I never thought he would find me saying that to any movie. Out of a Go-nowhere band that plays the lead role, I also thought that the rest of the cast continued to suck the life out of this movie. Uncle Charles was upset when he tried to humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted by her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ?? all right ?? Everyone practically falls into that category. <br /> <br /> How did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this movie? Not for special guest stars because, although this movie could boast about something, there was definitely none in the "unforgettable" House Party, nor the possible dream that maybe Kid or Play made a final appearance. House Party 4 did not follow a pre-established design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the base down. Can someone explain to me why there was a need to use the humor routine of the "escaped assassin who turned out to be a licensed taxi driver"? Stokes was reaching deep into the bottom of the canyon and only produced more dirt instead of substance. For once I can admit that this movie has no redemption value. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I hear there may be more in the pipeline, I just hope Hollywood realizes that this series is dead. Hollywood must let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to Who is the man? I would start them in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
