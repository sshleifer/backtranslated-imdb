Another production of Lo Wei to completely waste the talent of a young Jackie Chan, To Kill With Intrigue is a strange mixture of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and the simple old school kung fu fight that is quite boring despite presenting several surreal moments of WTF. and many ridiculously bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer Bees, a gang of ruthless assassins who are about to attack his house, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a hip without heart, distancing her and thus saving her from danger. <br /> <br /> During the attack, all of Cao's relatives are murdered, but the gang, whose leader leaves a scar, faces Woman, seems to have the hots for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whose security has entrusted his close friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> During his search to find his true love, Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo he has. has been stolen by the leader of the evil clan 'Bloody Rain'. Finally, after being wounded in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a funny scene with many silly weapons), and then recovering from health with Killer Bee (who shows his love by burning his face), Cao ultimately finds out that he is a lousy judge of character: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than the hungry chief of power of the 'Bloody Rain' clan, who has plans to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br /> It indicates the prolonged climatic battle, with Cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before finally suffocating his traitor and ex-friend with a scarf. <br /> <br /> Even Chan fans will find it hard to sit down, with only the final fight managing to show off some of the star's incredible acrobatic skills. Freaks of Asian rarity in general could unearth the spooky appearance of the Killer Bees at the beginning of the film (with a character who inexplicably claims his hand cut!), Or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but for most, this movie will have a very limited appeal.
