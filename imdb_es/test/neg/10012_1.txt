This movie is absolutely frightening and horrible. It is not low budget, it is a film without a budget that makes Ed Wood's films look like art. The acting is abysmal, but the sets and accessories are worse than anything I've seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of the murderous mutants, Woddy Strode has a bullet and the fight scenes are recorded in a disused gravel pit. There is a sadism as would be expected from an unpleasant 80s Italian video. No talent was used to make this movie. And the female love interest has a huge Italian flavor, maybe. Even by the Italian standards of the 80s, this movie is pretty horrible, but I think it came out at a time when there were not so many movies available on video or the viewers were not really demanding. This piece of junk has no entertainment value and is not even fun, just boring and extremely cheap. It's really an insult to the stupidest audience. I wonder how an actor like Woody Strode ended up being a turkey like this.
