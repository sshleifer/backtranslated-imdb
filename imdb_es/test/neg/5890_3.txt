I just watched this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a good and exciting sports movie. What I got was something cliché and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw the star this hurt a lot before the game. I thought maybe they would wait until it collapsed until, you know, the game before the "big one", but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> The parents' relationships were also very cliché, with the drunken parent dominant (I'll say McGraw impressed me, though), and the child who wants to stay and help his mother (sick?) . <br /> <br /> I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie during the 5 minutes, and who were placed there simply for the football players to take action. I thought "well, now, how does this work in the plot again?" Maybe I missed the point, beyond "Well, they play football in a city that loves him, so the girls throw themselves at his feet". <br /> <br /> The sports action had some good points, but most of it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than the set-up of all the playoffs! And I was not so sure of the continuity of the settlement clock in the final game. <br /> <br /> I suppose I could see this movie winning the ESPY for the best sports movie if it were the only release. Honestly, however, I found it a boring movie full of obsessively sick people with pigskin. For a better football movie, see Remember the Titans.
