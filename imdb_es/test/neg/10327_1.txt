This movie is so bad that I lost too much time talking about it. So bad ... really ... BAD ... and I'm not even that critical ... I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've seen him ... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she really did ... I mean, really anything next to this is really worthy of Oscar for her ... I guess the only way I see it is that there's no choice but after this ... I guess she had to start somewhere ... but really ... very bad ... ... horrible really ... bad is a word too good for this s ** t ... but I do not want to understand now ... but really How can you not, after losing 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life that I will never return ... 90 minutes could I have spent doing something better ... like sitting on my ass and staring? in space ... that would have been a better spent time ... (he walks away shaking his head)
