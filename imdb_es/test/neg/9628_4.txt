I really do not hate Mirrormask. I really wanted more of a movie than pretty visuals. The film begins with a young woman named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to flee to the circus, she just wants to run away from the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana would like her to die dead. Bad move. The mother gets sick with ... something (presumably cancer) and she needs surgery. The night before the surgery, she dreams that she travels to a wonderful world composed of her, her dreams and nightmares where she "finds" herself. Personally, the movie went to hell as soon as she started dreaming. The first scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the desolation of the hospital and the dirt of an apartment block. But as soon as she dreams, all the movies change to CGI land where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this world of dreams does not have any of the mysteries and wonders that it should have. While films like the Wizard of Oz seemed tempting to explore, Mirrormask puts images on our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. There is little rhyme or reason for the design in this film, and although some things are very nice (the librarian is a masterpiece) they disappear so quickly that they soon forget. Helana and her partner Valentine are, at best, annoying and unbearable at worst. In general, Mirrormask is like a beautiful stake that bites and discovers that it is really ash. Stay with the children of the real world.
