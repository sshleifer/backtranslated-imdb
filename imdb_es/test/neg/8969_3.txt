Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I have not seen or in her early film career is a delight, and at that level the movie is fun, but it's horrible like Hill Billy. His famous enunciation of New England slips, making lines like: "It would be better to stir some Vittles" rather ridiculous. She is so pretty and so young? It almost overcomes this great defect. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and therefore, a younger generation may think it's a pretty corny thing, but this was the staple of American Entertainment until well into the 1940s. It has its moments, but it's possible that You have to be a movie buff to appreciate it.
