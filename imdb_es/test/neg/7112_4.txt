A low-cost, low-cost police thriller that is supported by some fragments of good humor, good chemistry between the two protagonists and, especially, the satisfying turn of James Remar as a narcissistic, psychopathic villain (and, of course, indestructible) . Obviously, a low quality image, both visually and dramatically, with a fairly resigned Burt, but you can not see it. (**)
