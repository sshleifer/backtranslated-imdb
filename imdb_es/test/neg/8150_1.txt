This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but it is NOT worth waiting for. After an inexplicable discussion between two boys who collect garbage in a movie theater with coaches, we cut a family that leaves! Hollywood and driving driving your motorhome through the screen again and again as an inane dialogue is expressed. At least I think it's crazy, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so hard that sometimes the dialogue is almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the caravan arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family leaves, has another insane conversation, before leaving. Then, the camera moves to reveal the actor we have just seen moving away. He speaks directly to the camera and we realize that he is the director of the film we are watching, which is about him and how he came to make the film. <br /> <br /> A good idea that ALMOST (but not quite) makes the previous sequences worthwhile. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, he meets the two characters we met collecting garbage at the beginning of the film and they all form a film company. <br /> <br /> All kinds of comedy not very funny and clumsy occurs when they form a team and try to raise the money necessary to start filming. <br /> <br /> This movie was obviously put on a chain of shoes and a promise. and there is a small idea here that struggles to get out, but the execution is so inept that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than things that simply fall down and everyone speaks (or shouts) at the same time. Much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously: Robert Altman can do this kind of thing well because he has a script, essays, decent sound technicians and editing facilities. Everyone shouting into the microphone that, from what was heard, was hidden in a garbage can in the adjoining room, it does not give clarity.
