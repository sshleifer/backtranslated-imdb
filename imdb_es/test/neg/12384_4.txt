Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while testing a flight on an airplane, but nothing appears on the radar. Then, airplanes and ships begin to disappear and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out that it is a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> This has all the right elements for a classic. It has a really entertaining script, I never really got bored. The acting is good (for a monster movie of the 1950s). Morrow does not exaggerate in the act of macho hero and Mara Corday is quite good as the interest of female love required. She is also strong and takes care of herself, even though she WANTS to get food and coffee for everyone during the movie. The problem here is the monster. My God, it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a crazy turkey! He has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, some strands of hair on his head and claws. And - oh yes - he screams! Not roaring - squawking! The actors had no idea how it looked, it was added after the production. The actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw him in a theater. Morrow said his audience laughed and left the cinema quickly before the movie was over! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster of all time. And you can also SEE the cables by moving it! This gets 4 stars just because Morrow and Corday are very good and the script is well done. You do not get stars for the pathetic monster. Wait to see how it attacks what is obviously a toy train! It's worth checking out if you're a terror fan to see what the stupidest monster of all time is.
