STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation that continues to swallow everything in its path as the construction of the new Delta City continues and a new threat to deal with in the form of Cain, a cruel drug trafficker with delusions of Christlikeness, selling an addictive new mortal in the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his previous life chasing him, the tinned hero tries to take down this villain, only to end up being cut into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless business woman from OCP proposes plans for her new android, a trampling and grumpy beast of a machine that needs a test subject equally unpleasant to be able to, that Cain fits perfectly. After a brief failure in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and solve the problem with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a film that always manages to surprise you every time you see it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those movies that you just can not do again. That said, it's not surprising that a sequel has been made; It is even less surprising that that sequel really pales in comparison to the original. The director of Empire Strikes Back, Irvin Kirschner, has created an unpleasant film, slightly incoherent and too long that can not capture the magic of the first film, no matter how difficult it may be. And it certainly does, the funny announcements of the first film that are running do not stop, the corporate satire aims to be a little sharper and the action roars as fast and furious as before, but with blood / blood even more cruel than the first film. The first film won a name for unpleasant and blood-soaked violence (including the genitals of a man and a man torn apart), but although that was more memorable, the violence / blood shown here is more sadistic and free Nature, with a very nasty and mean tone. <br /> <br /> But in general, the movie leaves you with a feeling of general apathy. Why are you seeing this when, instead, you might be seeing the original again? ? **
