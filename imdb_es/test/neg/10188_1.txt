This movie was a big bait and change. I rented it thanks to Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and I wondered what she would do in a UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think he starred in this film to help a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie was not what it was supposed to be when I witnessed the special effects of UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I realized how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (There are some exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was verrryy disappointing. She is always found in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of a person whose husband has returned to the fold. Do you never leave home? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe in the message of this movie, believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change OUT OF LOVE, NOT FEAR.
