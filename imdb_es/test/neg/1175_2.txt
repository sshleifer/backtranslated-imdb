Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is located in the small American city of Plainfield in Wisconsin during 1957, where the lonely Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone on a farm after the death of his mother and brother. The local police have had a series of serious robberies to deal with, and when the local waitress Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) grows the suspicion that something nasty is happening. Ed is a violent and sexually deviant man who kidnaps the girls and murders them. Will the police discover the truth in time to save Erica (Adrienne Frantz) from the Sheriff's daughter (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Michael Feifer, this was an attempt to Basing a horror movie around the real events that surrounded notorious serial killer Ed Gein and turned out to be crap. Real life Ed Gein was only convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but several films have been inspired by him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000). The worst Gein movie in history. Even though Ed Gein was real, almost nothing in this film is based on a fact, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims was related to any of the investigative officers, there were no victims of car accidents, although Gein maintains His name of other people have had name changes, the kidnapping and murder of the two women represented here actually happened four years apart in reality, but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days and while Gein is shown here as a great muscular man in reality He was emaciated, thin, old and quite low. As a drama in fact, Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is worthless and as pure entertainment is not better with a boring and deadly rhythm, the characters are boring and when he is not killing someone, Gein is seen working or walking . around and it's very boring. There is no suspense because we know who the killer is and it is just a tedious wait until they catch him at the end. There is no real attempt to enter Gein's mind with the manufacturers that do not give him more motivation than him to have hallucinations of his dominant mother. <br /> <br /> Here there is not much blood, there is a scene with a woman hanging from a meat hook, there is a very poorly edited scene of Gein cutting off one leg, there are the usual organ flasks and body skulls out there , as well as a bit of blood, but really there is not much here to get excited. Obviously, the film was processed to discolor much of the color of the image, since sometimes it is not very far from the black and white, I personally think that the lack of color makes it even more boring to sit. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of around $ 1,500,000, I really can not see where the money was spent on a production that is hard to forget. Although set in Wisconsin, it was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is totally wrong with the role of Ed Gein, only from a physical point of view, Hodder does not even remotely resemble Gein and gives a pretty poor performance, since he only looks at the camera making silly faces. br /> <br /> Ed Gein: The BUtcher of Plainfield is crap and it's as simple and straightforward as that. Whether it's a real drama or an entertainment of pure exploitation, it's a total journey from beginning to end with nothing to recommend it.
