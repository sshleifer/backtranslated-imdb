As a fan of movies with the lucky job of video store manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very bad. This was a movie with so many corn ball lines, corny CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing a lot before turning it off after 30-40 minutes. The genre of films "characteristic creature" has been publishing some pretty horrible things in recent years (Godzilla 2000 someone?), But this movie makes me think that the creators did not even try. It may be worth checking out just for the potential of "making fun of me" (count the shots!), But I can not in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.
