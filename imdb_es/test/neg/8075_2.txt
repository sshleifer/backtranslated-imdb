Stephen King's TV movies can go in 5 or 6 parts and nobody complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS miniseries, but would a partner of two kill someone? The film moved on the events that should have been mentioned and the events that could have been omitted. I want to salute the performances of the stars ... they had a difficult job because they did not look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out an American Movie Classics movie that had real value and I laughed at myself. The film was quite emotionally hard, especially after Curly took the hit and Moe needs to keep the business going. When Curley started crying, I lost him ... As I said, the movie was good, but it could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better. Although it may be appropriate ... the Stooges were scammed when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
