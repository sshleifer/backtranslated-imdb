To remake "Lost Horizon" as a musical, the need for a musical composition of the type Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe was necessary. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That said, what I like the most about "Lost Horizon" is your score. It's just that the marker does not fit the piece. The cast is mainly composed of non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, they were dubbed, and they still do not sound so good). <br /> <br /> Frankly, the novel, in which This, and the previous versions of non-musical films were based, is mediocre, at best. While the possibilities of a truly good film musical version exist, they are not made here. The film manages to be a good vehicle for rainy days, to pass the time. Otherwise, you will be better off buying the CD of your soundtrack. It is only recommended as a piece of curiosity, due to the terrible reputation of the film. I have seen much better; but I've seen A LOT worse.
