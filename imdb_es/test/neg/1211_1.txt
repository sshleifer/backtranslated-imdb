I wrote spoiler alert, but in reality there is not much that can be spoiled. It's like spoiling rotten meat. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not for the actors or the special effects, but for the large number of errors, both physical and de facto. First, MIGs are not really MIG. They are mirages, and they are French. And how on earth can Doug's father endure the maneuvers his son does to fight the "MIG" without a g-suit? And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? And how could Doug defeat the enemy pilot pilot so easily? Anyway, I did not like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the last since 1995. Now that's scary.
