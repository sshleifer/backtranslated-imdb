Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic book showcase for their side band Tenacious D, an art-rock outfit with satirical and barbed letters. An ex-fugitive obsessed with heavy metal and a lazy guy who lives on the beach and smokes, who pretends to be a rock god who finds himself and forms a band (the birthmarks on both buttocks form the group's nickname). Opening with a funny prologue that shows a video of Twisted Sister of the 80s, "The Pick of Destiny" is a fairly well produced film aimed at older children; from time to time it does not look like anything other than a middle-aged variation of "Wayne's World," with jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic bout with Beelzebub himself, though Black and Gass have an enormously comfortable relationship ( they also acted as producers, co-wrote the script and all the music). The audience to which we are heading will obviously do it, although the inspiration is a little low, especially in the second half (almost at the same time that our heroes impulsively overtake the police in a student-driver car). The music sequences are much more successful than the satire attempts of a film and, during the first thirty minutes or so, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
