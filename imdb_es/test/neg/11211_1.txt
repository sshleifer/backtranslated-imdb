The plot is very basic, but acceptable: a young American soldier, who has studied Asian martial arts, gives him a good use in defense of the general's daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, the combined IQ of the three main active parties (soldier, girl, rebel) amounts to 3: one point for the soldier, one for the girl, a large number of ninja fighters have to share the third point between them to be able to lose against the first two.
