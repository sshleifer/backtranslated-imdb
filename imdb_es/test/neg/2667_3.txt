Okay, what the hell does all this mean? Halloween 6 (let's call it that, okay?) It's, without a doubt, the most CONFUSIVE movie in the series (and from what I've heard, seeing the original "producers cut" does not sound like it made things any less disconcerting than the "official" release). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is not a really bad movie, as some have said. It has its scary scenes and some pretty intense moments, it simply SHOULD NOT HAVE A SENSE! Do not tell me that Michael was "designed" from the beginning to be bad and kill and destroy, and blah, blah, blah. It was bad enough when they turned Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis' brother (only to have an excuse to keep her in the second movie): this is too much. <br /> <br /> It seems that this is another case of the creators of the film who try to be "too smart" by creating a new premise that will surprise and impress us all. Bad movement, guys. We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael kills, so do not try to feed us this shit. Show me Michael looking menacing and killing a group of people. Show me Dr. Loomis trying to locate him and, as always, falls short. Do not waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of Donald Pleasance telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that Michael was "created" by some cult of hell and that his "seed" will be transmitted to another and ... oh, brother. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 has its moments, do not get me wrong, and we all know that there have been worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) so see what can come out of it (the scene towards the end of the movie with Michael charging down a dark red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the plot of the screwball. Hopefully some day we can all see the "cut of the producer" and perhaps we have the opportunity to give a little more sense to all this. Until then, this will have to do ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
