Sometimes it is difficult to judge how bad a film made in Italy or Spain really is, because they all seem to use the same stable of 9-10 voice actors trained in ESL to supply the English voices for release in the United States. And, anyway, things are always lost in translation: the dialogues, the characters and the elements of the plot written for the expectations of European audiences may not go very well with our American ideas of what is fun, modern or dramatic. I imagine that the team responsible for doing the translation of the soundtrack of this film into English had approximately 3 days to do it from the beginning to the end, and probably each one got the equivalent of a installment payment on their used Fiat to do it . In other words, pure piracy, shot in one or two shots and never reviewed or remade by someone with a real ear for the American language. <br /> <br /> Watching "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if an Italian looks at this presented in their native language, it may be a little funny fluff. You would laugh at the "jokes" and the funny drunk, panting at the monster and the villainy of the bad guys, and laugh at the attractive pair of Peter and not quite as Daryll Hannah while they Couple on the beach for no apparent reason in A search of clues about a man-eating monster that has already killed one of his friends. <br /> <br /> But since the discordant voice acts and the dialogue of fallen ears We can not stop taking Americans out of the cinematic experience, we can not help but notice that the editors had a serious Attention Deficit Disorder , that no one on the screen can act as well as project an Attitude, that the stated reason for creating the monster makes no sense, that the action sequences have the full impact of a cereal bowl filled with cooked oats and that the director , the writers and the producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Do not even THINK about buying or renting this movie: just watch cable TV on Saturday afternoons with one of the various beers in your fist, or with the help and protection of Mike and the Bots in MST3K.
