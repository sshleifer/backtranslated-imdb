Thomas Edison could have done a lot of great inventions, but WTF is this! I'm sorry, but this movie is just horrible. The plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point and is electrocuted. Well, the quality of the image seemed like someone used it for toilet paper. I thought that the first Charlie Chaplin movies were horrible. All right, Thomas Edison may have been an inventor, but why did he make this movie? I could have filmed a baby being fed and it would have been better. People might say that I'm being hard over time, but that I would enjoy something like this from what I said Edison might have done the light bulb, but why did he make this movie in particular? Well, I can sound like a full hole ##, but look at this on YouTube and then you'll see this abomination. I still can not believe that this movie is completely horrible. All in the worst short film I've seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
