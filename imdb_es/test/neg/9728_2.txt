"Nobody really knows how the Power came in. Not even the Book of the Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who dominated it have always been hunted." The Ipswich families formed a Silent Alliance "blah blah blah" After this Introduction, suddenly we see taking that. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, maybe? Well, I do not know which one they belong to, but one thing is for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy band. Can you tell them apart? I could not If you can tell me which one is which, I would really appreciate it. These guys are so similar! Seriously now. Is this a horror movie or a movie for teenagers? It's sad that the horror genre (anyway weak) has been hijacked by teenagers. And this is one of the most adolescent I've seen so far. The film is visually solid, but the cast is so insipid, the acting is so horrible, that it was a test to finish the movie. As bad as the cast was (after all, boy bands and fashion models are rarely good actors), the absolute "distinction" in this sense was the guy who plays the villain, Sebastian Stan. The exaggeration of this type is among the worst in the history of cinema. I have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly faces in such a short time. What's worse, it has the most childish face of all the childish faces of the whole cast. I mean, it's a joke.
