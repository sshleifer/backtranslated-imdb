For starters, I really love Lucy. Your television show still makes me laugh. She was one of the greatest comedians that ever existed, along with Chaplin and Keaton. But, his performance in this film is disappointing. She was too old and the gauze filters on the lens made her look like a London fog refugee. She could not sing, and her voice was so soft that she sang every song. His dancing days were long in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not overlook this misguided and sad interpretation and sing praises. I prefer to remember Lucy in her wonderful television series (I Love Lucy) and draw the curtain of charity on the terrible disaster of a movie called "Mame".
