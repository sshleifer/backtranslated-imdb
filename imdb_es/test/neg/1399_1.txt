This is one of the most ridiculous westerns Hollywood has ever done. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former Confederate officer wanted by law. He meets an imbecile named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is a US Marshal. UU Without knowledge of firearms. Weatherby heads to Dallas to see his girlfriend, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Mr. Robles, Tonia's father, has many men, but it seems that they can not keep an eye on their cattle, which the Marlow brothers steal regularly. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has financed the loan at the Robles estate, making things completely absurd. It even has the power to request payment of the mortgage before it expires, simply because you feel like it. <br /> <br /> Since Weatherby is a guy from Boston who can not fight, he just became a quarterback. He could visit his girlfriend, Tonia, (Another example of more plot nonsense? We must assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy could not pass the written test either. ) changes identity with Reb Hollister, who, of course, is an expert armed man. Reb takes the liberty of greeting the Weatherby girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's number one stallion, is in good shape here as Reb. Before the film is over, he not only takes Weatherby's work, he also steals his girlfriend, and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls in love with him so fast and so hard that he gives Leif Erickson the rejection before the movies little else From the half. <br /> <br /> There is not a hint of credibility of the plot throughout the film, so despite the good cast and the exuberant photography, the film is a failure. And the character of Cooper is a full heel to boot. The film is also starring Barbara Payton as the girl of Brant Marlow, a beautiful and talented actress who missed her chances, unfortunately, making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I suggest you pass this.
