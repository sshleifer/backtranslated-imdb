Quite possibly one of (if not the) worst movie ever conceived, broadcast and performed in the history of cinema. Who in the green earth of God would ever think of throwing Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like her mother. God forgive me but I'm just being honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plague this horrible excuse for a movie. It was a horrible statement against women, but at least if you're going to blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story, not one with so many annoying holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and excitement. Everyone should get their money back, who went to see it in theaters or bought the DVD.
