The overrated comedy of the mafia. The director Demme makes the actors stop after some fun lines for the audience to laugh, and do not miss the next line. It seems strange - this director did "Silence of The Lambs" - now there is a way to use breaks! The casting seems off. Mathew Modine is too young for the FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson thing with a strabismus, and he gets a nomination for that! Also, do we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a Mafia lawyer are underutilized with only one line each, should be the whirlwind bells. The score of Chris Isaak's song is totally out of place, it's better for a movie like "Pretty In Pink". Make this film again, it's worth it, but with the right casting and director, the satire will go ahead ... even the repeated "Forgedaboutit".
