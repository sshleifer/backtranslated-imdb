STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The little journalist Orthodox Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) walks away from his time The local police and trying to fall in love with a member of the police staff. But everything changes when the owner of the pub on the Thames side that he frequents is murdered and finds a transcription of an unpublished novel and confession of the legendary writer Charles Dickens. As you go deeper into both mysteries, you become more immersed in the mystery and danger of what you expected. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with her classic gangster cult. Blocking, stock and two smoking barrels. Granted, no one was impressed by his ability to act, but his presence as a tough man seemed to be ready to ensure a decent career as a hard-core kid. But everything turned out to be a one-hit wonder, and all he really accomplished after this was to support role status among much more acclaimed actors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the realm of the DVD to hell , the last being this confusing and laborious thriller, which could have been fine if it had not taken other acclaimed and promising stars of talents like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What made him fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (aside from being a pony of a single trick) is anyone's guess (an unreliable personal life is a possible conjecture) but here it is. <br /> <br /> A script as implausible and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in the hand of anyone, but with an evil looking at Jones at the head, it is even more difficult to understand. The juxtaposition roles of Jacobi as a former vagabond and Dickens himself speaking directly to the camera are obviously suggestions that point to something and the script is also predictable in other areas. Add to this production values ​​of cheap appearance through the debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley has caused a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly did you expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *
