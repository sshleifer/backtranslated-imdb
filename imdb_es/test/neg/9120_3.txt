I suggest that if you have already seen the original Graffiti from the United States, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen the original, I still do not recommend it, but it will be much less painful to watch. The characters in the first movie are great, and in the end you fell into a connection with them. This movie aims to show how bad their lives have become. It is a task to see! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters in the first movie. In '64, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional racing racer. Meet a foreign girl, Eva, and although her plan is not going anywhere, it is the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith) who is trapped in Vietnam, and most of all, wants to leave. Try to find ways to hurt yourself or do stupid things to get out. In '66, we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl that Toad picked up in the first movie. Now she's a hippie who smokes marijuana, and I'm really not sure what her plan was about. It was her going to a concert ... nothing happened at all. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) have marital problems that end in a demonstration against the war and a police action. <br /> <br /> None of these stories is very good. The script in some parts presents very, very bad dialogue. These poor characters that I enjoyed so much in the first movie, ended where they are here ... why? Why was this sequel made? I guess if a sequel was made, it had to do with the Vietnam War and the action of the hippies and the police, but the truth is that this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The address was elegant, but it only amounts to a big headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just a regular widescreen (depending on how you look at it), and the rest of the film should be filmed. The plot of Toad was filmed in 16 mm, and what it amounts to is a poor looking image, which is the size of a small box in the center of the screen. The plot of Debbie is shot in multiscreen. At one point there could have been a screen, but for the good majority, it's two to twenty screens at a time. Do not bother trying to follow the screens, since nothing happens anyway. The plot of Steve and Laurie has the strangest filming style. His style really does not mean anything, and it's silly and meaningless. Instead of a full widescreen, it is a condensed widescreen that looks like a full widescreen version. Although I do not like others, at least I understand what they were talking about, this simply does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the salvation of this movie, it's not like I can save this! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have good songs presented here. They do not keep the function, they only make it a little better than it is. It is still bad! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a meaningless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 110 minutes PG for language, drug use and violence.
