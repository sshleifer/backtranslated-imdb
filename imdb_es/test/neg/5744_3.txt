It's about some vampires (who can run in the sunlight), which are causing some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his team of commandos to investigate. The film begins with Van Dien & Co. walking through the jungle, and there is a huge black man who absolutely, absolutely can not act. Speak all your lines as if you were reading them for the first time. His voice is also so low that, well, it's positively hilarious. Great way to start the movie! Anyway, they meet some of our vampires, they shoot them (this makes them seem to die for about 20 seconds), and then, of course, they come back to life. Van Dien realizes that one of them was impaled on a branch of a tree and yells to his friends to kill them with wood. The trick work must be seen to be believed, vampires are on wires that make them climb trees, which is supposed to make them look like they can climb very easily, but it only makes them look like they're jumping on elastic cords. or something like that. <br /> <br /> Yes ... anyway, later, the huge black guy is in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included), and they are attacked by more vampires. It is really very bad that these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it seems to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers, but instead they use big wooden stakes with which they try to impale the vampires with their hands. The big black guy ends up being captured and eventually becomes a great vampire leader. Van Dien ends up fighting him later. It does not help that throughout the film, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they eliminate them for about 20 seconds, which would allow a person to hit a stake quite easily. They only try to bet on them in the middle of a hand-to-hand combat. Yes, they are not exactly brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> There's a sexy babe (remember Veronica from the TV show The Lost World? Yes, it's her!) She's also walking through the middle of Vampire County on some kind of research mission , and also happens to be Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the odds? It's a pity I'm not in the movie much more than her. Will she and Casper come together again at the end? Will Van Dien defeat the huge black guy who can not act? Will the vampires of circus artists make you laugh through the many action scenes? Will we listen to the music of the three puppets when someone does something funny? Even Lynda Carter has forgotten how to act in her little cameo (she is more convincing in her commercials of Sleep Number Bed)? These and other questions will be answered if you arrive until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know, I could score some points on the bad scale that is good, but that's it. Hey, it's a lot of nonsense running through the jungle, I think it's kind of entertaining.
