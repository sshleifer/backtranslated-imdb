Ivan The Terrible is more a theatrical work filmed than a "big screen". Citizen Kane, a similar job in many ways, is quite the opposite (in the way we can expect such a fee) in that it has many shots in place, for example. <br /> <br /> Act is to convey a Motivations and thought of the character to the audience. If he manages to make you understand the character, what does it matter HOW it was done? And considering the low amount of action, how else can you express the events that influence the story and, consequently, the machinations and decisions of the characters that are not "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a historical level. That is why the acting style should not surprise. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the Soviet Union forced the filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew. Because they were prevented from accessing more modern works that showed the evolution and techniques of cinema, they only used what they knew. <br /> <br /> The control of the Nazi government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s, due to its total control over that film industry. And propaganda films can only "entertain" both the German troops; Hence the need for popular German silent films of the 1920s, for example. So many of the techniques in Ivan The Terrible's film would have been derived from the captured German films supplied to the film crew (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There was no confusion anywhere and, personally, it was found over promoted, it is by no means a bad cinematic experience, and it is definitely NOT among the worst movies in history. The acting is fine, and part of the cinematography is excellent (even by today's standards, below). It's definitely not a popcorn movie; One can not leave his brain outside the door of this. Perhaps dated and very symbolic: it is only worth seeing on the big screen if one can not see the movies with the lights off at home, since many of the cinematographic elements will be lost in the mainly black and white experience of these films. It all depends on the expectations with which one enters ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Do not read the following comments, in case they influence your personal vision of the film (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if one does not care about obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan is how Stalin saw himself, it is obvious in his influence on the direction of the film (see other comments), and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the perspective of the United States will definitely understand. Maybe Ivan was an earlier incarnation of Stalin, or maybe not; this is more a diatribe about Stalin and his motivations, decisions, solitude, promotions of lackeys, etc., using Ivan's personality, than any true historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of particular colors in the sequel: Red (for the USSR) at the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the US) during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many excellent images, such as the deep use of shadows, or the outside taking of the population that comes to beg for Ivan's return to Moscow.
