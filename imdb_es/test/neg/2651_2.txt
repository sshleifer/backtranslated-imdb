Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department. Try to catch the bad guys, but do not do a good job. When we meet him, he is trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire senator, Kay Chandler, who is trying to be re-elected. She is running against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She is a policy, you can not get bogged down by feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I was looking at my watch every five minutes asking when it would end! The story is lost in details that the director, Sydney Pollack, did not have to present. We do not want to know about Dutch police investigations. They provide a vision to politicians and the "control of rotation" they make for campaigns. After watching the movie I still wonder why they got romantically involved. Nobody laments more? Do not you need more than two weeks to consider going horizontal with another person? <br /> <br /> It was good to see the actress, comedian, Chicago native and Second City alumni Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily a comedic relief, but she was the only one I wanted to see more of. Do yourself a favor, wait for it in the video if you want to see it.
