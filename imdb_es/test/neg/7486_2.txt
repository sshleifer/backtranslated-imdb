I had picked it up again and again in the rental store, wondering if I should give it a try. Today I collapsed and gave it a turn, and probably should not have done it. <br /> <br /> While the writer / director gave the film a respectable effort, it was not very attractive. The characters, while you wanted to feel them, simply did not have enough development or depth for you to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual outbursts got tired ... fast. I do not care about sex in movies, and I do not care about the malicious characters, but being a "bad" girl does not mean you are prone to ask people enthusiastically if they would like to have sexual favors. The moment it was revealed what happened to the characters, I was bored and ready to move quickly towards the climax, the ending, anything exciting ... and nothing was delivered. The things that the people in the story finally tell you seem forced and unrealistic, and they just did not play at all well. If they had thrown a little more anguish there, I might have been interested. This should have been more of a suspense / drama movie, and should have adhered to the title "Jon Good's Wife" instead of the whole "red right hand" and cover similar to a horror movie. Hell ... this should have been suspense, period. <br /> <br /> Either way ... look at this on a rainy day or at night when there is nothing on television. While this is not as good as I expected, I would look for some infomercials.
