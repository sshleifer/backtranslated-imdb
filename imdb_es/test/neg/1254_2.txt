Having finished reading the book "One of a Kind" a week ago, I thought: "This would be a great movie, especially now, when people know a little bit about poker and poker players." I was totally surprised to find it while browsing the video store last night. I had no idea that someone had turned this into a movie. I grabbed him immediately and watched him well in advance. What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> All the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were quickly reviewed, and instead I was left with a biography that could have been about anyone. Ungar may have been a burned imbecile, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. That's what made it so fascinating. Why not focus on that? <br /> <br /> And talk about diluting the real truth. This type was excessive in absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep deprivation. He bet on sporting events from dusk till dawn, he disappeared for days while he spent his time in the crevices, his body was perpetually emaciated and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat almost anyone by playing cards. . That is a story! <br /> <br /> He spent too much time in his childhood and in his personal relationships (although his links to "Vincent" and his daughter barely touched) and almost nothing about the use of drugs (which was exorbitant)), your crazy game and your amazing card game skills. <br /> <br /> It's probably too late now, but I hope someone recasts this movie correctly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent The script left him with nothing interesting to say.
