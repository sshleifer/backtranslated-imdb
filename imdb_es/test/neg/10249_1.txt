... what would a porn movie look like if you took the sex out and just stayed in the bad dialogue, the cheap stages and the bad performance, you would have Galaxina. <br /> <br /> This movie came out when the original Star Wars showed that there was a market for science fiction. This in turn led to some gems like Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I had not heard of this movie until a few days ago, I missed it when it went on sale in 1980). <br /> <br /> Here is the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton could not act, so during most of the movie, they did not even let her try. I understand that his tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for my life I can not understand why. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the movie tried to simulate Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens. But they clearly do not understand that when talking about something, it has to be FUN! This movie was not, or at least, the comical timing of jokes that might have been funny, they were not. Science fiction is ready for parody, as demonstrated by Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest. This movie, however, did it badly.
