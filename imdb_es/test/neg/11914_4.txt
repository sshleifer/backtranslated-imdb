None of the entrances of Chan de Monogram is better (neither does it try to be fun here). The Shanghai Cobra has much in its favor, but, in the end, it is too confusing and messy to be too satisfying. The movie starts with a killer named Shanghai Cobra who has already hit twice and now it is a scene in a restaurant in some way. We have a boy, a girl and another boy who has some implicit connection when a man dies in the streets. Yes, I am simplifying things here for reasons of brevity, since this really is the core of the problems with this movie: it has many things without a real and satisfactory explanation. I have not even entered the kitchen restaurant that has some participation and a jukebox that talks to you and has a screen and everyone does not seem to have any problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then, Chan enters the film working for the government and flying to help a friend. He also has the right to check a bank's radio store and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages who he helped arrest in Shanghai many years before. I thought the plot was very complicated as stated above. Toler is back like Chan. He is always affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland have also returned. They both do good jobs and are pretty funny. But the complicated plot simply did not convince me, and much of the film was seen with a strange and questioning look. This is not a bad movie, not just a very interesting one, except for the most devoted fans of Chan.
