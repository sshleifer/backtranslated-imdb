"Tales from the Crapper" is bloody, disgusting, insipid, offensive, scant and scatological. But it's okay, I was prepared for all that from my previous experiences with Troma. What I was not prepared for is that it is also ingenious, not funny and boring. Very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "Class of Nuke'em High" has remained intact; Instead, we get jokes UP ENDLESS (to the point where you begin to wonder if Lloyd Kaufman is becoming senile, thinking adults seems that farts are fun) and a cynical and shameless exploitation of the beholder, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. Oh, yes, there are a lot of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn film offers probably a better story, values ​​higher production, more fun humor and, above all, more respect for this atrocity intended viewer. <br /> <br /> P.S: Kelly Powers, AKA Suzi Lorraine (lesbian blonde student in the segment "How to Make Your Own Movie") is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.
