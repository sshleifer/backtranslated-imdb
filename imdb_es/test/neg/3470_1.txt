I'm sorry if I disappoint someone for what I'm going to say to this television movie. But, I paid money for the movie and it turned out that this movie is a disaster. The address is really very bad. But, after searching your information here, I realized that there could be reasons for the poor quality of the address and production. Maybe they have no budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's sense and sensitivity also had little money but it turned out to be a success. The director of this movie did a really bad job in telling the story and the movie could not even maintain a rational continuity in itself. I still get scenes. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the story / table. The bent sound is also terribly bad. My God ... Normally, I would appreciate each film because behind it there are ideas and imaginations of an individual. but, this time I'm just angry, "I really want to hit something HARD". ... Just do not do the work if someone can not fulfill it to the fullest. Bad art (it's not even art, what is it?) It really hurts people.
