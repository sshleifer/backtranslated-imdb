With the opening of a cheap store, I thought it was worth seeing if there was a cheap DVD that looked good. And although the back of the cover made this sound like a movie like Jeepers Creepers, it's actually an anthology movie! and I thought that one or two of the stories seem very familiar to me. It is still a light and funny comedy / horror. The plots: <br /> <br /> Story one: the classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels it is time for them to try to prove their financial life by picking up a $ 1500 car. But when the man picks up a car, a car starts talking to him. The car (called Banns) says that to get everything he has ever wanted in life, he must buy Baans for $ 5000. So while the guys The relationship falls apart, Baans does everything he can to prove who is really position. <br /> <br /> Story two: the kitchen of the kitchen. <br /> <br /> A man who could be expelled by his lord from the land, Because of how messy his apartment is, he discovers that due to keeping a tuna paste in his fridge for six months, he has now molded and evolved to become a green and moldy version of himself. And while they start as friends, they end up having a big fight, which leads to a final battle to see if the real man or his refrigerator clone will survive. <br /> <br /> Third story: too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl registers at a dating agency and compares it to The boy is perfect for her. But she is not sure that the boy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees him "quiet", she starts to get scared. View of the film: <br /> <br /> The first thing I have to mention is the rating of the film in England, where it has been awarded a rating of eighteen years, even though it has no nudity, insults or blood. all. And the other strange thing about all the stories is that they all have a happy ending, where the goodies win. And while the first story is too close to Stephen King's classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film. , with director Tom Parkinson making the madness of the story feel like an episode of low budget Muppets. <br /> <br /> Final view of the movie <br /> <br /> While it has a bit of 'redoing; I feel there is enough madness to make this a 'comedy' of terror.
