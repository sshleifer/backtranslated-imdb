I saw a piece of pseudo-intellectual trash a couple of years ago, and now it's coming back at the local movie club. Use all the clich√©s of the Manual for creators of intellectual films (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines it to be. He gets his tempo in slow-motion execution, brown scale, slow movements through bombed environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, excessively symbolic images and the necessary miserable end. <br /> <br /> It's a complete failure, a perfect unintentional caricature of the typical Russian art film. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has an excellent command of the technique, but he lacks eye. He does not see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wet dream for lovers of art movies. It is at the height of every stereotyped vision of the genre that exists. <br /> <br /> If it was bad in an entertaining way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you leave after the fight, we need a new term. This movie is a Sokurov.
