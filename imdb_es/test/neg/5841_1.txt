Obviously, several agents did not see past the dollar signs when they registered their clients for this * 117-minute * page of the courtesan complex. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie could have been fine, there would have been $ 1 million left out of it. Seriously. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers everything" can change the fact that no marriage should mean "richer for the poorest, for procuring as in fidelity". However, imagine the story in another way: 2 children, with the floor broken, in the limit "desperate" and completely stupid. They collide with the rich businessman. The marriage of children is tense because of imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, who exudes charm and stability, a virtual magnet for the biological clock, and with it the temptation, tensions and suspense of his wife. Who will you choose? Maybe, under those conditions, I really could care. As it is, frankly, the selfish and manipulative Playboy of Redford ends with the nice character. A woman who will sell herself alone is what a man who pressures his wife deserves. The indecent proposition turns the husband into a TOTAL loser, deficient in all positive masculine characteristics, and makes the wife a cheap nonsense seduced by money instead of confused by another potential love, a woman without a moral center or respect for herself same <br /> <br /> All the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted in this movie, and it was an impressive amount, it could not save it from its $ 1 million line of release. If I see this turkey in a bridal shower anymore, I'll roast it! (Or maybe cross it with Titanic and throw the ribbon in the ocean!)
