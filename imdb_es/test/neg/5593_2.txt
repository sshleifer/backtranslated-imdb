Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thought?!?! The first 8MM movie at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the tobacco film industry. This sequel is about ... wait ... the porn industry! Yes, as if the tobacco film industry, an industry in which people are supposedly killed in an entertainment movie, were in the same league as the adult film industry, an industry in which people film other people who participate in sexual acts and situations without stimulation. For eroticism. The idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea is for this movie alone. It is not helped by the lack of plot, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme or even sound design. This is a very boring movie that never caught my attention. Literally nothing works. Why would a thriller and mystery about the porn industry with murders and betrayals work anyway? I'm not very interested in adult films, but I've certainly seen them before. Why would someone make a movie about the evils of it and what would it do in a sequel to a movie about snuff films? I do not even know if there is an industry involved in making tobacco films, but I hope that is not the case. The idea of ​​a tobacco movie is only horrible and only people who are really sick and ill-formed would be part of it. I do not think the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I'm pretty sure a lot of people make pornographic movies with good intentions instead of hurting and killing people. It is never okay to hurt another human being. The adult film industry is not about hurting people. It's about creating movies that are, for me, a detour and a waste of time. What is this movie trying to say? It does not work
