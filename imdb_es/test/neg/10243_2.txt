This is not the worst movie I've seen in my life. I did not feel like I wanted to take off my eyeballs by force after seeing Galaxina. It's just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but they fall short. All of them. The few gags that approach are knocked down by repeating them over and over again. Production values ​​are, well, non-existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it seems a cheap fact; too The dialogue ... well, often missing, many uncomfortable silences; they are all standing, and it seems that someone should be saying something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be; It is not always clear that it was a comedy, like the one that developed after shooting began. It feels like the project of a movie that was released together the night before it expired, and if it had been two weeks, it could have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought "Mom and Dad save the world" were hilarious. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is very close to being a classic. This turkey simply does not do it. "The truckers of space" were more credible. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. His part requires a heterosexual man, and he interprets it by leaning towards the situation comedy. Dorothy Stratten is fine in her role, but not particularly remarkable. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the "My watch is always slow". The line was fun. I will give this film all the congratulations I can get, I need it. <br /> <br /> Spacecraft models are not bad, but they are few and not used effectively. The spatial scenes are vague. There are no sweeping passes, no close-up detailed flights, not even the appropriate action scenes when they dock. (Infinity lands very strangely at one point). The flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything you have seen, they are spasmodic, not smooth. The initial battle is forced and static; despite the fact that the two ships have just demonstrated that they can maneuver unevenly, they exchange (slow) shots at close range in a manner reminiscent of a sixteenth-century naval battle, except that it is not so exciting. <br /> <br /> The Aliens: imagine if all Star Wars was the scene of the canteen. That number of rubber masks can dull pretty quickly, right? Some are used as visual gags that work well the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, if you try to look at Galaxina, it is likely that you fall asleep. (I took care to do something else and I missed the last ten minutes, and I felt it was not worth repeating.) If that does not say "Stink," I do not know what he does.) Unfortunately, there is a lot of potential, and this could have been easily a good movie. It would be easy to redo this and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
