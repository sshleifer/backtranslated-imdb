"D.O.A." is a non-thrilling thriller by the directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Jankel. The acting is fine and the script is pretty bad. This movie also has some moments that will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are. <br /> <br /> For example, someone is shot near a window. Then we see from the outside <br /> <br /> the building that it seems that the person jumped. I laughed when this happened. This movie tries hard, but in the end it fails. Just watch this movie <br /> <br /> when you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My review: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> <Br /> Reasons for qualification: Violence and language. * <br /> <br /> * There was no qualifying reason available due to their age.
