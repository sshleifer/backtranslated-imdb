I can not believe that this is a movie that I did not like. . . Usually, I find that I am open-minded about all kinds of things. . . but this movie is just, well, bad. <br /> <br /> I could address the issue if the script and the story were better. I could deal with acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established. . . However, I think everything is reduced to the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> It was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give this the lowest score, but. . . I do not believe in that, at least this guy went out of his way to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating he has so far)
