Sorry people, I love the work of Ray Bolger, but the only thing that is not an important man. Maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth, this romantic plot could work, but now it's coming! <br /> <br /> Here is a film that exists simply to show the title song that was a great success for Basie Band The previous year (1951). And some pretty ingenious songs and dances save from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the story line is pathetic, even by the musical comedy standards of 1952. And the other songs are as forgettable as the Evening In Paris colony. Dialogue shames the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin's Boyeresque charms keep his character in three dimensions. <br /> <br /> So, how to enjoy this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast-forward through all the dialogue ... <br /> <br /> B.) Surrender to the voices of Doris Day and Ray's loose-limbed footwork Bolger And do not miss Dauphin's hilarious version of a "April In Paris" version, soaked by the rain ... <br /> <br /> C.) Finally, keep a couple of cold and practical Cabernet bottles. br /> <br /> Bob Raymond
