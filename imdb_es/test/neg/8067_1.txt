... forever! (I always wanted to write that :) Many years ago (in 1993, as I recall), one of my former classmates convinced me to observe what he called "an epic masterpiece". Today stands out as the worst movie I've seen in my life. The acting, the history, the effects, everything is bad. Unless you are one of these people who loves to appreciate garbage, this must happen. However, most likely, since you're reading this, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> Of the almost 500 films, this is the only non-short film I have given 1/10. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other low budget Asian warrior movie, so I think there are even worse things out there! Fear ... <br /> <br />: P
