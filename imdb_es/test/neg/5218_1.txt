When you see how this DVD is done, they tell you what is being tried here, they are telling the biblical story of good versus evil and they are trying to preach it to a movie audience. In a modern society like ours, this is where the movie fails. There are too many sheep represented in this movie. People are too well trained for this type of preaching today. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, directing and technical functions, they are fine. Chuck Norris is actually fine as an angel, since the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers in the 1960 comedy.
