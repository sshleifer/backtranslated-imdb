Recently I have seen a series of caving movies and this movie managed to get into the worst aspects of this kind of movies. You get very little appreciation for the surroundings of caving or the monster they face, while the characters are clich√©s (spiritual type, leader with a tragedy in the recent past, etc.) and the end was weak. It really bothered me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create an atmosphere. I have read that this film gave a real representation of speleology and yes, I imagine that the caves are dark. Show almost total darkness for half the movie really brought home. I really enjoyed the "descent", which, for my money, had a better performance, showed more accurate speleology situations, better monsters and had a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <br /> <br /> The monster turns out to be a guy whose plane crashed and killed his parents, leaving him to grow up in the caves. It seems that he developed super strength and speed, but why he never approached, maybe the same force that exhausted his torch batteries caused this, but during the movie, every time someone dies, he has the impression of something big with claws that destroy each victim (Do you see how much blood splashes the walls?) But in the end is just a guy with a coat on him and a mask? I would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were achieved, but this was not the case. Then he begins to violate the last caver and roll credits ... I thought, almost absurdly wrong. Sometimes a movie is so bad that you can appreciate it and maybe laugh, but this movie is not taken lightly either. <br /> <br /> You saw it, you can not get it out!
