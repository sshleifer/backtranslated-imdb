I should start by saying that the actresses and the actor did a good job for what they did. The problem in Dark Reality is that you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative that he ended up destroying the movie. From the beginning to the end you can say that the quality of the film roll itself is low, but the poor light and the shaking camera only hurt it even more by hiding what is happening. The sound is muffled and often is not understandable. I'm sure Huston (the director) would argue that this was to cause a panic in the audience, but he had more than enough material to do it. Having to use the camera and illuminate the way he did was a sign of an overcoming syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A basic and sadistic story of kidnappers that avoids clich√© by keeping girls in a state of desperation all the time for good reason. Billy Bob of Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that the dead constantly harass the main character in their mind, and when they appeared for the second time, I quickly got ahead, as I was trying to destroy the only decent part of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, the way the director put it together showing random fuzzy things and barely visible constant scenes (not because of the horror, because of the lighting, the angles and the camera) finally destroyed this movie . Huston obviously was trying too hard and, in any case, it looked like a bad project of a film school. If you want to see a decent story, then that's fine, but keep in mind that the quality of the movie is enough for most to turn it off.
