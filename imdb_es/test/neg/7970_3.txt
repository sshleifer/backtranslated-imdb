I have not read the book on which the film is based, nor the lyrics between Vita and Violet. If I came to this movie with any expectation whatsoever, perhaps the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf, of which the Nicolsons were part) would be described. It was not, which however was not a problem for me. What I wonder is how the people behind this film managed to do it, in my opinion, very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters are flat, despite the great material and some very good actors. The script is simply not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor: too many scenes of meaningless sex (but only between women, while there is nothing explicit at all about Harold's numerous love affairs), too many scenes with no sense in general, very little information about the background of the characters. It seems strange considering the quality of the production: at first glance it seems a really ambitious work, but the script has more weight and that's where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold seemed unconvincing, although both act really well, especially her. The way they kept declaring their unconditional love to each other in a pretty sacred way, I thought, well, simply unconvincing. It makes much more sense that I should have gone through the lyrics, since tmmvds points out that I would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from, the Russians * and Mar, why does anyone ever call Vita get the nickname Mar? It may be small things, but it is important to contribute to the big picture. <br /> <br /> * I saw the movie with English subtitles, and where apparently Mitya should have said, Medea said. That could explain my frustration with nicknames to some extent. I could not understand why Vita's should be Greek while Violet's was Russian!
