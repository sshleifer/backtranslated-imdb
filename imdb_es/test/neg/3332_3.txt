My boss at that time and he showed it to us at a Halloween party in our office. He is the Chris Huntley who co-wrote and acted on it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks a lot like a vagina to be a coincidence. Maybe it was because of a gynecological experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a VERY low budget and the actors were all friends, so what you have here is a case of "hey gang, let's put on a show". <br /> <br /> No one was hurt and it was a first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. He made everyone laugh and it's a great movie to see with friends and make fun. :-)
