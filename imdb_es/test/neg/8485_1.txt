I can not believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carries in the movie he has a baby, but instead it's a movie with fucking actors, stupid plots and stupid scenes. This should be in 'sh * t fuck movies on earth'. Thank God, the director himself did not do this because he is so stupid with some parts of cartoons that the fart was not funny, neither urine nor dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid this person was like Homer Simpson making a movie about a donut! I want someone to remake the son of the mask with a plot like this! The type of mask (Jim carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal baby. When the baby finds another mask, he also became the mask and the boy in the mask tries to recover his mask! This is very bad, so I will give you 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
