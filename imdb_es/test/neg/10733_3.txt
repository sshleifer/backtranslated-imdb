Detective Sergent Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and company are in the case of a cruel serial killer / rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help, or will she become the killer's next victim? And what about the hilarious White Dude Afro the killer? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the case of serial killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight", also known as "The Dark Ride", is a rather boring tale of Serial Killer from 1978 that does not offer much. In any case, it is more a procedural police film than a horror film, since much of the violence occurs outside the camera. Sure, we receive mutilated bodies, but we do not have much in the exploitation department, especially considering that they are of consequence and not during the crime. Those who expect the likes of "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an awesome scene in which a woman tries to escape from the killer who has the right tone, and is quite suspenseful to boot. In addition, John Karlen is quite effective as the killer, although his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with Afros always deserve a giggle) is more than a little annoying. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and Mediocre to really justify a recommendation, as it lacks the proper operating elements and is even dated according to the standards of the time. Those looking for a better example should probably resort to "Do not go home" and some others, since this simply is not enough.
