I do not understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is an acceptable entertainment. The hallucinating horror of this cinematic monstrosity can not be overstated. My girlfriend and I saw it together, and I'm not sure we can ever have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the squalid and unattractive cast, its extremely non-phototic genitals, the rancid attempts at humor, the shrill noises that were said to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what It was the worst of all. The girls in the green leotards, with green facial paint, licking Alice to dry it, propose, in a broken children's speech, to extract milk from their breasts. That was the worst. <br /> <br /> Also, what happened to the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding the vaginas of the others? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty move a dildo in the air and pretend it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see this? There are no words.
