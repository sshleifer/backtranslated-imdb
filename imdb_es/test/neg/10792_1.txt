The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the jungle / African plain. It is a turkey and others. What it really is is a wildly mismatched sequence of the first sound and silent movies mixed with recent (for the release) images of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, natives of the southern seas at sea (used to represent people in the center of Africa), bikini-clad women, a horrible narrative and a guy on a spine with makeup throughout his body (racially insensitive I think so). This is a movie to sit and laugh, but only with many alcoholic drinks and witty friends. At any other time, this will be a difficult task to overcome. It's a bad bad bad movie. Beyond that I am speechless
