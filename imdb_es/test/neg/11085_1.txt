My first post on the IMDb must (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste time with The Cavern! There is no story, there is no character development, there is no fear, and there is no good enlightenment. It does not make any sense. If you enjoy the bad performance, people run through small portions of caves, bounce the cameras at angles and people scream while the screen is in complete darkness, you will love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream too, and I would not have to pay the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone really made a movie so horrible. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've rented.
