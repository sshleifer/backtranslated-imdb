First, and for the majority, I would like to say that I have stopped retiring after writing well-deserved commentaries about horrible movies. Only the movie titled "The scarecrow turned wild" could bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> That said, I'd like to start with this comment. OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean, I know it was going to be bad. But I had no idea that I would be spending 60 minutes of a possible 90-minute movie laughing at what I thought was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest flaw in the movie (for me, that is). Ken Shamrock. Now, if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now, if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or so it seemed to me). I mean, how else do you explain all your lines? My favorite line of all his times in this so-called movie was "It's been a long time." IN AGREEMENT????????? The funniest thing about that line was that no more than five minutes before he said that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the children who were soon to die about how the scarecrow could not be killed. So, if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he begin to try to fight it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that is)? As I said before, it must have been comic relief, except I do not think your UFC friends were laughing. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished that well-deserved paragraph in the movie. <Br /> <br /> I admit that I can not remember many scenes, and that's not good considering that I just watched the movie more than fifteen minutes ago. So, what I'm going to do is list the five main things that are wrong with this movie 1. Usually, when the monster in the horror movie has its own theme music, it is not heard by the victims or the monster per se. So, why could all the people involved in this movie make this pathetic whistle? I mean I saw the face of the scarecrows and none of that said he was the kind of whistle. <br /> <br /> 2. Why the hell were there murders on a beach? I'm sorry, but the historic beaches are associated with holiday time and holiday feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it would be so successful that it would change all that. Also, it was me or the beach seemed to be the size of a living room. I mean that every time an actor or actress ran on the beach, it seemed that they ran in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl running in gray pants. That really bothers for the duration of this movie. I mean, she looks so ridiculous. In addition, it did not help that it seemed that she was the youngest of the group. I mean what was like twelve or something like that. There is no excuse for someone to be so thin with the camera. I mean, the camera does not increase by ten pounds or something, so what was your excuse? <br /> <br /> 4. People trying to get recording offers in the camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not become more corny, the desire to be Gorth Brooks arose and, oh man, he was lame. I do not remember the whole scene, but from what I remember, it was not pretty. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I do not want to say anything that has to do with what is happening in the movie. The funniest part of the whole event is how everyone seems to be enjoying this. I mean that the only person who does not really know how to respond to this is the "symbolic black man". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken, it was he who encouraged this latest addition to American Idoal. But this is where it gets fun. While this guy is in his new song or whatever. In the distance we see or villain also known as the scarecrow. And boy, does it look good? I mean there's actually a time when he seems to be really jealous of this guy. So what does he do with this jealousy? Well, I'm glad you ask. Wait for the boy to finish his song, and then fix it. I do not want to reveal the scene of death, but I can tell you this. If that scene does not make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will do it. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was much longer than I expected. And it did not help that they tried to get some pathetic twisted bulls at the end to squeeze out another 10 minutes of this movie. I mean I admit it, I did not see the turn coming, but it had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping the movie was over and over. But they did not have to do it they twisted. Needless to say, when I say that, I just turned off the TV and said it, there's no way the movie got worse. Thanks to my good judgment, I can say that I will never know what would happen next. But I promise you I do not care !!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole movie is good for laughing, but please do not buy it. Just exalt one of your friends and look at the expansion.
