I really wanted to see this movie, after having spent some (fantastic) university weeks in Barcelona. The premise is correct: a confused and disorderly young man enters a world of equally confused and disorderly young people. But the director's weaknesses in the face of symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely out of place, and that leaves us, the audience, feeling confused and disordered. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Maybe if this movie had been presented as a European movie of "American Pie", then I would be able to turn off my brain and go down the road. But from the beginning, the director awakens our deepest senses by introducing the symbolism of crooked roads and the dichotomy of the "inner self" versus the "public self" (the "mother tongue" versus the "secondary language" of the person) . . In addition, he boldly immerses himself in the topic of racial / national stereotypes. An interesting start, huh? <br /> <br /> BAD. That is all that goes. These interesting topics are almost never mentioned again, except in the final conceived of epilogue type, which seemed to be the way the director struggled to return to the subject. It reminded me of a snaking speech that is not going anywhere, but the speaker ends by saying, "So, to conclude, I hope you see how this relates to my original thinking!" <br /> <br /> In addition, as other noted critics have done, the cynical prick to stereotypes betrays itself. If the goal is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, why did the director introduce an English brat who talks cockney and drinks beer as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally beating his chest and making simian noises at a given moment) while the Europeans tolerate it in an exaggerated way? Why is it the British girl who sinks to utter insults (who call the French "frogs" and kills the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this is not a deep or well thought movie. It is simply a replica of Anglophiles to Anglophiles. But in reality it is not different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there is a funny irony to consider. <br /> <br /> Leaving philosophy, art and socio-political comments aside, this film still bored me a lot. There's a very funny joke that involves tricking one of the girls' boyfriends, but other than that, it barely entertained me. The only reason I saw it until the end is that I would like to improve my French and Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans can be stupid, but we try).
