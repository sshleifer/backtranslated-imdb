This homemade horror movie tells the story of a guy who kills people using the motif of Edgar Allan Poe stories. Local police have failed the case for some years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the boy is, but apparently nobody has thought about going through his house, because that's where he is hanging, running with his vintage clothes and torturing the locals at random. So the FBI girl is kidnapped, which involves her father, the former principal investigator of the local police. To make matters worse, a group of crazy university students have decided to camp in the house and smoke a lot of grass. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the FBI agent ends up screaming and running like a little girl. , and not a single one of the big college boys thinks to simply stop and take a look at the weak child Poe. Mostly exaggerated and sometimes underestimated, Dead End Road reeks of a low budget production and cast with friends that has too many starting points to cover them.
