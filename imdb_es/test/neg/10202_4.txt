... in search of the movie "so bad that it's good", I've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of several films, only to be disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes filled with tears, my stomach and cheeks hurt from laughing so hard during the whole movie. Of course, Hulk Hogan is an unsatisfactory actor and the plot is completely predictable, but everyone is immersed in this movie knowing all this: all anyone wants to see when they rent this is Hogan pulling out a can of whoopass, with a lot of "YEAH BROTHER "s and" WHATCHUGONNADO "are flying from his infamous mouth. And while the Hulkster on the screen pales a bit compared to the Hulkster in the ring, the finest cheese seekers will certainly not be disappointed by this reverse gem of a movie. An uproar of laughter.
