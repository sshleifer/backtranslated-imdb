I think I watched the movie two years ago and to this day it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after watching this movie was that it was made for some fiscal reason. So after all this time I finally spilled my intuition;) And now IMDb says I have to fill 10 lines with comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment. , go back to the edit window (or use the BACK option if this is not a new window). "<br /> <br /> Please, there is nothing to say ... <br /> <br / > Sorry for something bad English.
