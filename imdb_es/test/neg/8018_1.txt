Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. From his novels some really wonderful movies have been made ("Far from the maddened crowd", "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", "The mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had high hopes in this. The Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-ification of "Return of the Native" totally destroyed it. The cast was fantastic, the photography excellent, but the script was bleak and the direction was positively ruinous. People approached people, they said lines, they walked away. A little excitement developed when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a little pressure, but even Clive, who is an excellent actor, could not save him. It was flooded with the typical "romantic" string music of Hallmark and supposed bumpkins that offered a plot, and what could have been dynamite turned out to be horrible. The wealth of the three previous films was completely absent.
