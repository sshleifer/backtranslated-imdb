Although inevitably linked to the decade of the 70s, the concept of "exploitation-cinema" is actually almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios practically invented the term with its long-running monster cycles Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Each original classic generated a couple of sequels, at least, and after a while, they even thought of making a real monster stew! "House of Frankenstein," released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too crazy to recommend. The plot suffers too much for 'coincidental' situations extremely irritating, twists and forced dialogues and ?? especially ?? a too short execution time to elaborate the personalities of the monsters as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive the best turnover, but plays the most fundamental role as a miracle: a doctor who has the challenge of curing Count Dracula (Carradine) of his irrepressible thirst for blood and to fix Lawrence Talbot's disease of mutating into a man furry wolf when the moon is full. During a night walk in some caves, they also collect the remains of Frankenstein's monster and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a metamorphosis of Jekyll / Hyde due to a bad blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (though not Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you are watching a movie that is literally full of horror icons, but the only character in the whole movie who is able to scare you is a common villager named Siegfried. The real monsters are boring and their funds that were once fabulous are completely exhausted. Count Dracula is a romantic whiner, Talbot is a pitiful and also an old martyr and the creation of Frankenstein. Well, your participation in the plot is not even worth mentioning. In this Universal movie, there is a serious lack of atmospheric environments and ingenious photographs, especially compared to all his other efforts, and the abrupt climax is a disaster.
