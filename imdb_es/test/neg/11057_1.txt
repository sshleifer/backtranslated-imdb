I found this movie for a dollar ($ 1.00) and the movie was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), served as a military advisor in South America and managed to capture the leader of the rebel soldiers operating outside the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after they inflicted horrible tortures on women and men. In one scene, while Mark takes a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes can catch a glimpse of the sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra make each other on the they even make passionate love in some very hard rocks, without time for the comforts of a bed. This is a horrible movie and it's not worth wasting time to even see it.
