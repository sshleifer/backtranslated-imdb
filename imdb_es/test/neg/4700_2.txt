It seems incredible that the same decade that took Star Wars to the silver screen was as unsustainable as this and many other "adventure" movies. They remind me of the splendid, but equally unfortunate 'Ashanti' described elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Any actor on the A list motivated to log in for such celluloid debris is frankly beyond this writer. They must have been very, very desperate. To be perfectly honest, the appearance of Roger Moore in any movie is the kiss of death. Although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career has been based on the ability to raise an eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is transmitted by this simple stratagem. His were the days of the James Bond dogs. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, has appeared on some very valuable outings, perhaps more memorably "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen." He has a comic streak, but he's much better when he plays straight. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a disposable, barely recognizable as an African mute. All the others just showed up for their paychecks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and visible element is the German cruiser. It seems a very big model. But it is incredibly massive and seems authentic, as is its crew. The rest is not even hokum. The children's comedy mixes with brutality and violence in a story that meanders awkwardly, as if the script itself had too many flavors of Lee Marvin's gin. Here is a director who simply does not know where he is going. There are hints of 'The African Queen', a fragment of 'The Pride & The Passion', 'Gold', and one or two other movie scams whose titles are not easy to remember. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I've seen it 3 times, every time it's been on TV when I've had a cold or flu. Maybe that influences my criteria, but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I've given you two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, although heaven knows that it takes that. <br /> <br /> It's time for another Lemsip, I think.
