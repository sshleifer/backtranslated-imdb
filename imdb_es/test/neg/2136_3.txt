WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The ripples of the first "Jaws" movie were still prominent in the 80s and beyond. The cinematic monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts that lurk in the unexplored corners of the human experience (that is, the ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular realm of cinematic horror, few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (also known as Devil Fish or Red Ocean), is an obedient follower of the original "Jaws" formula. After several unfortunate boats and sailors are brutally killed by some ocean creature, there is an initial impulse to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results and a final push to destroy it. Although the filmmakers tried to inject some new life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is disastrous. This movie sinks under its own weight of frightening editing, fragile acting and cheap fears. <br /> <br /> The most unhealthy feature of "Devil Fish" is its cut cookie edition. Since the beginning of the film when 3 different scenes are combined, the viewer has the feeling that the film lacks technical credibility. It seems as if the editors cut the scenes around an established musical score instead of cutting the film and then making the necessary changes in the music. In addition, each cut is an interleaved cut and it seems as if the editors have never heard of the terms "disappear", "erase" or "dissolve". The impact of the scenes can never be established because they are cut immediately after a final line and a new scene begins. Camera tricks abound, as when two of the main characters share a private moment on the beach and a kind of time-lapse image of their act is composed on their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is equally soft. The theme of the creatures is a hopeless duplicate of the theme "Jaws" with a slight variation. Although I like to keep my comments without the influence of MST3K, Mike described the grim score as "soft porn music". Not producing tension in a movie that depends so much on it is a deadly blow to "Devil Fish". The acting is outdated, the relationships disconcerting and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why could not a more practical use be given to the best humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the idea of ​​the monster, even though its presence in the film is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is bad enough to fall below the mediocre. If "Jaws" had never been done, then the movie could be described as average because its theme would be new and exciting, even if it were executed ineffectively. Sadly, like a carbon copy of Spielberg's original thriller, he sits more comfortably in a pile of cheese garbage.
