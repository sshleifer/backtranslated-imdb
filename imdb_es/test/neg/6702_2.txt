I suppose the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is really despicable. I was offended by the tone and the end of the total copy. You can not take subjects like this so lightly! Without knowing the final warning of the movie ... we see a man shoot his 9-month pregnant wife and two children, and we're supposed to follow him for the next 2+ hours while trying to establish a new life. You can not have sympathy for a character who does this. Can not! Not to mention that we have not been given anything until the last word 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, as to why this guy is suffering so much. There are no flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement, things that real veterinarians are suffering. All we know is that her ass hurts and she can not take care of her and her 3 children financially. There really does not seem to be any research whatsoever about what current Iraqi veterans are going through. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film suffers tremendously from a heavy score and a totally inappropriate score. It is a catastrophe. It is really harmful for some people who act well on behalf of the male leader and, sometimes, Joe Morton. This prefigures EVERYTHING you're supposed to feel, and sometimes it gives you the wrong clues altogether! Once again, this was something brutal that this guy did, and therefore, seeing him get a new job, meet a new blonde, fight behind the counter. It's NOT appropriate to make toast! And really, the end? What a fucking cop! How dare you? <br /> <br /> There are much richer films that deal with the effects of war on returning soldiers, please do not worry about this.
