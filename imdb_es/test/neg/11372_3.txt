This movie was not as bad as the story, but the camera work is what makes it difficult to see. I just do not like the so-called "realistic" camera work that is being done today; You know the type: jump out of the center, spin around, etc. However, what irritated me the most about this movie was the new thing that was thrown into the mix by photographing some black and white frames in each scene. I think the film would have been much better if the camera work was filmed in a much more conventional way because, as it was, I could not concentrate and I found myself analyzing the work of the camera instead. Maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with the camera work like this, the filmmakers will finally get the clue.
