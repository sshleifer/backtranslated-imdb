This film is, everywhere and without a doubt, the worst and most despicable film in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> Really * it * is * so bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible movie, and I rented it thinking it would be one of those. To my immense disappointment, it was not. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that sounds like they're reading the lines directly from the banners, the story does not make any sense at all, and the real movie looks like it was filmed on a video camera homemade I could not even finish seeing it. It's even worse than "Witch Academy", and that's quite a feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to understand how a director can film this movie, and then I still have the sense to believe that it was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, horrible, horrible.
