I recently had to see this for a project in a Sociology class and I thought it was absolutely the worst movie I've ever had to watch. It was as if it were a bad movie with all the "good fragments" taken out. The bad performance, the false documentary montage, the meaningless plot and the rudderless direction combine to make a terrible, terrible film. <br /> <br /> Female characters are basically just sexual objects. Consider this exchange: "He is hot." "He has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "Do not." * The girl takes the children's hand and carries it behind some bushes. the boy comes out and sits next to another boy, the girl walks out "Did you play that?" "No, I did not want to take off my pants." "You're stupid." Another girl appears when the boys go to Beverly Hills, gets in the trunk with one of the boys and when a policeman stops them, one sees that the car goes up and down. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, a Clint Eastwood with a happy trigger look alike, and what appears to be a wrestler mask adds to the inanity. One of the boys is caught by a policeman, nobody cares. One of the boys is shot, nobody cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. Simply unpleasant I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
