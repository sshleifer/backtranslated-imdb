Comedy? What's funny about seeing an ugly alcoholic who attends 6 sessions (for when I turned it off) of Alcoholics Anonymous? It started with an unfortunate script of grunts and whispers and drunken whispers. Served with the lashes of the Hollywood religion. "God will save you." Redemption. Another critic mentioned Tea Leone's "Brazen Dialogue." Well, I managed to see almost an hour of this boring movie and I still have not seen anything brazen. In fact, my 80-year-old grandmother has more fun comebacks than Tea's character in this garbage. The tea has a more stony face and shows less emotion than Keanu. In fact, one wonders if she is not addicted to something either. Maybe the botox on his face is so stiff? Save yourself from being killed with boredom of this movie.
