Why do those "romantic" movies that never get anywhere, always start (and probably end) with shitty jazz? It's not smart and makes it look like a bloody television movie. This movie was sappy, slow-paced, boring, unoriginal, wooden, and did I say boring? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Probably, Harrison Ford was trying to be mysterious and crass, but he was just a dragged and mumbling policeman who looked like he walked into the house of the congresswoman as if everything he was fine, when he behaved like a pervert, looking at Thomas with a perverted look, he almost never bothered to talk. <br /> <br /> And why the hell do they always get British? actors to put shit accents: they throw themselves because they're famous, and everyone knows they're British precisely because they're famous.
