I do not know why IMDb lists all Ghoulies movies as theatrical premieres. Everyone went straight to the video movies. The same with the Puppet Master series. Why has not anyone noticed this yet? Well, somehow, you've run into Ghoulies IV, probably raiding an old video rental store abandoned since 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this ... Look at the back covers. What are you waiting for, the Redemption of Shawshank? There is no need to review this movie so critically. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was 6.50 ... I knew it was not Kubrick material. And he was right A DVD not finished without extras, not even a trailer, has a sloppy movie. <br /> <br /> It actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... who really did not get many. 'Great' roles apart from those two movies. And I do not see why ... He's not such a bad actor and he's very funny. But I suppose if you're going to take a leading role in the Ghoulies movies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot partner Bobby Di Cocco, who despite having a small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), does not retain any of his acting skills ... A complete idiot who is uncomfortable to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall, obviously a porn star, I do not need to look for that. He looks pretty sexy, although his disguise, his character and everything he does drag the credibility of the film, which is not an easy task for a film like that. <br /> <br /> Then there are the Ghoulies! Those who also manage to disappoint us. Ghoulies III made them start talking, mistake no. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the Ghoulies are in fact CHILDREN IN COSTUMES !!!! The filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the audience. Also, there are only TWO of them, and they are not the highlights of the movie, since they do not appear in many of them. However, sometimes they are VERY FUN ... And they are not bad this time either. <br /> <br /> This really is something tremendously bad, it's amazing that I could actually enjoy it. I do not know why ... Part of the black humor is really fun, although the script is mostly effortless. Imagine that Satan's only threat to you is to "kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least the Full Moon was not involved this time. Did they do it? Yes, a very bad and cheap movie made with 0 production value, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
