Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series. Just think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that nobody really cares about! So how could this be good? Well, it is not! But since when do slasher movies have to be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the field of entertainment, we've seen better, that's also safe! As you can see, I'm not sure what my position is with respect to this movie. Those who look at slashers just for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie is all tits, but unfortunately there is no blood, or not enough. I think I'm being generous with this movie because I had a great time watching it and I really enjoy watching Slasher movies, even if they're as bad as they sometimes are. If you want to be honest, The Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and all the others are a waste of time, so I guess I have a lot of time to lose. For more fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
