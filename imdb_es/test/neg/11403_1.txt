Yesterday was one of those days that we decided to go to the movies. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less at random, but we were interested in seeing the state of the current Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess right away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their appearances in soap operas and / or evening talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some pretty decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what an error it was. This film fails on all fronts. Bad performance (the best performance is actually a guinea pig, which convincingly simulates being dead). Flat story, without interest, with unexplained and uninteresting comments (Why France? Why tell the story to a Ugandan girl?) Mistakes (blacks do not have to use sunscreen, as far as I know, and the systems Heating in the Netherlands does not produce steam clouds like in New York, even if this looks good in a movie, people do not wear t-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There's a fun moment involving two small dogs, and that's it. <br /> <br /> So that's what I think, but the most important thing is that it seemed that none of the people who left the cinema had enjoyed it afterwards. I heard one of them say that he was extremely disappointed, because he liked the book very much. I did not read the book, but my advice should be: read the book, not watch the movie.
