Oh God. Why is it that Nickelodeon is so hard to produce a decent half movie? I mean, this movie could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Quite superficial, stereotyped and insulting to some C. Lately nonsense <br /> <br /> First Instead, the theme of "dressing the nerd so that he looks good" was VERY consumerist, VERY superficial, VERY meaningless and very insulting. He has the stereotypical nerds: stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, vacations with his mother, etc. Well, maybe the reason why that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay. Does that mean that all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with being a friend of your mother? <br /> <br /> The worst part, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the movie revolved around Zoey when she discovered that Chase loved her, and blah, blah, blah, and then, when Chase finally decided to tell her, <br /> <br /> A. she did not tell him in person because, just as she was about to reach the typical distraction, B. tried to send her a text message, but her PDA fell into a fountain and died before she received the message. <br /> <br /> The End. <br /> <br /> HOW IS THIS SO MUCH ????? I mean, why can not caricaturists change anything in the series? Many of us would like to see these two meet. Why can not we see it? I mean, are the producers really so uncreative that they can not think of new problems to go with the changes in the series? So they have to continue with the same plot and schemes, and make as many episodes as they can by just using them? After a while, it becomes boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I WANTED TO SEE SOME CURRENT ROMANCE HERE, SAY IT! <br /> <br /> Agree. I'm done with my tirade.
