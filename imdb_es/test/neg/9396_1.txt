This movie was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure what book the writers read to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the real adventures of Frances Mayes' life in Italy. Instead, it is a story without interest that takes liberties at each juncture to hit men. Consider the following examples: <br /> <br /> ****************************** ** ************************** <br /> <br /> SPOILER DETAILS <br /> <br /> * ********************************************** **** ***************** <br /> <br /> Bash Number One: Lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Lane ventures into a local Italian city and every man on the street asks for it promptly. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Three: Lane is saved from the popular men of the city by lovely men. She falls in love with him after consuming an afternoon of love. Later he discovers that he is already linked and cheating with her. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Four: You have to expand your horizon for this because the reference is definitely in the movie. Her lesbian friends decide to have a baby by fertilization with invetro (SP?). They tell me that in most lesbian relationships, there is one person who assumes the female role and another who assumes the male role. In the film, after the woman becomes pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to remain unrelated because she can not handle it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film has nothing to do with the Book on which it was supposedly based.
