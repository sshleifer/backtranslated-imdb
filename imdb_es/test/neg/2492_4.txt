There are many other comments here about how poor this movie is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the biggest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Virtually all the silver in the country was devoted to the manufacture of cables for electromagnetic separators. If there was a choice between two alternative ways of doing things, they simply did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was lit under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students who handled axes as a scandal mechanism. It's a fascinating story with hundreds of places and thousands of people that this movie seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> The other thing that really upset me was the huge moral debate over whether I should continue the project after Germany surrenders. Okay, we have thousands of men (mostly) who worked for years to make a big boom. Does anyone think they did not want to see it work? There was some controversy at the time about whether we should use the device, but it was not so serious, clearly it is not the great debate that this film makes it.
