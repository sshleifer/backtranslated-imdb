Wow, this movie is bad. Think of "flashdance" with ninjas. The worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in the air, but you can see the ropes. Or maybe the worst part is the giant eye patch (which looks like a roller coaster) worn by the good ninja. Actually, there are so many bad parts that I can not decide which is the worst. I can not believe that someone really put the money to do this. The only value that redeems is that it is good to laugh.
