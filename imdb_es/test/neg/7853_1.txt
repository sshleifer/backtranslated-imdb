I do not see how someone who really read the mysteries of M. Didius Falco could make fun of them. An Australian does not have business in ancient Rome. None of the books are in this movie, except the stage and the characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough to read the silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff are very nervous when showing their names in the credits.
