I was so eager to see this when I was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Far away from the capricious world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and unpleasant, I do not think Dr. Seuss would have approved it. How it was that the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand that it contained some subtle jokes of adults, but my children still have not noticed. While The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity, they caught much more than I would have liked. Growing up with Dr. Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic shattered on the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton Hey Who. I hope this one does some justice to Dr. Seuss.
