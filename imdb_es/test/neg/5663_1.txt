Did you ever go to YouTube? Well, the definitive question to that is YES. Do you see ICarly and Nickelodeon boat loads? There is no definitive answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the Earth. I have seen many of the panning reviews on the head and some that have given a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for children, but the program is just horrible. <br /> <br /> If you did not read the latest review, here are reasons 1-8: # 1: Steryotypes # 2: Goofed- up drama # 3: everything is silly (taco truck, for example) # 4: Carly think it's good, but it's bad # 5: anyone of legal age to drink is stupid # 6: Is Sam small but strong? # 7: There are no real companies # 8: Bad teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: The webshow abuses 3DFX. Just look at the webshow to understand what I mean. # 10: The webshow also spills personal information. # 11: Almost all famous things are insulted. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There are too many recurring jokes (the obsession with Sam's flesh, Freddy's computer, Gibby taking off his shirt, etc.) # 13: Video games based on the show suck. # 14: Freddy has a lack of masculinity. Why? It is becoming unoriginal. # 15: The show is aimed at a female audience. I also hate programs aimed at male audiences, so I prefer that I be of both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Excessive use of laughter tracks. <br /> <br /> Part 3 will arrive in early spring! Just in time for spring break!
