This is a movie from the old dark house. A young couple crawls around a strange mansion that is said to be directed by Satan, from where they flee and enter one after another of a malformed crew: a lady in distress, an ape, a monkey man, a dwarf, several strangers. Looking for people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a type of "The price is right" contest consisting of climbing seven steps with seven illuminated tracks; hence the title. For my taste it is too much of the same. Crawling through the halls of fun houses is fun for a while, then it becomes repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy doing the same thing on two reels, it's not really fun. Nor is it terrifying, and apparently it was not meant to be: the home is too absurd. Most films of this genre balance comedy with a genuine threat, and usually two: one that the characters believe is real, and one for which it is a cover. Here the cover should not be taken seriously, nor is it covered. A few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's quite fun. The novel on which the film was based was a direct thriller and I think it could have been played directly for a better effect, and it could still be.
