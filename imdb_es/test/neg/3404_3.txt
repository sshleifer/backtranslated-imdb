I saw it AFTER seeing "Death Tunnel" (this is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life), so you can understand that I went a little blank when I saw the directors and producers of that cinematographic jewel . be in charge of this one. First of all, I thought that the director and the producer were the same guy. Both are Kid Rock and Dawg, the bounty hunter. I observed the TAPS research and I am not a skeptic. I think TAPS is the closest thing to a scientific method in this field. That was great and credible. I think they are spellbound. <br /> <br /> But this, like the critic mentioned above, like doing a tour. Okay, a tour, well, but the "researchers" and the "group leaders" seemed to earn a penny and have a financial investment in whether they are happy or not, so when they have fantastic stories, I have to take it with a teaspoon full of salt. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, I could distinguish what they wanted me to see in the image about 50% of the time. The rest of the time, I could not distinguish anything. Also without any context for the photos, the time of day, the type of camera, the humidity in the room, the dust particles (which are 75% of the orbs), the climate and other billions of factors, not I can accept them Nor can I avoid thinking that some could be manipulated. <br /> <br /> Why would that band keep the numbers on the door? Vandalism? Also during the TAPS investigation, they tried to unearth the death certificates of those nurses, and only found one that was declared "accidental" (people did not want to officially proclaim suicide). However, when one of the guides mentioned this, he said "yes, and it is a marked suicide". I really felt like the guides of the haunted houses here in October. <br /> <br /> However, I liked the interviews with the patients and the staff of the old hospital (s), which really gave them a lot of perspective and a personal touch. I'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best intentions and that they were not some macabre guardians. They were not the best methods, but it's all they had. They were desperate to stop the disease.
