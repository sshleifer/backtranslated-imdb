Yesterday I saw this movie and, like most of all, wrote "I also expected a Steven movie", God, I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very funny. I had some doubts because I read that I was playing "Ja Rule", but I thought that with luck they would give him a small role, so they do not irritate me watching him. And, of course, the opposite happened, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking of joining a team sry *** like this. Steven was bankrupt and needed cash? bah = (what a disappointment.) If you like Steven's movie, please ignore this drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10, but the "performance" of Ja's rule ruins everything. his friend kurupt with his irritating conversation about the hood. <br /> <br /> My beer went from having a fresh taste to the water in which we washed the dishes.The story had nothing "good" about it. I felt as if a 3-year-old child produced it. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Steven makes me happy again in a future movie.It is not worthwhile for people to rent this simpel. <br /> <br /> As bad and regrettable :-)
