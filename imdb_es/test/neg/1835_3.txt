This movie had a good premise to begin with. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really could not find out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many silly clichés of the worst of the old American Slasher / horror movies. Now, I love horror / slasher movies, but there are all the old clichés that have disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old man "I hear noises in the basement and I'm alone at home and the basement light does not work, so I'll go investigate" cliché. <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés really bothered me until the end: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente discovers that there may be a secret society at work in the medical school that separates the living bodies, she asks questions and tells EVERYONE. - Very publicly. In essence, she is saying: "I discovered you, come and kill me because I am telling everyone your secret". And then he wonders why he finds a spot of blood stained all over the bed and takes the cut finger of his roommate in a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after a boy he met two weeks ago ends up at the dissection table and learns that this secret society gutted people alive, goes to the lab where all the bodies are stored 2- 3 times more BY SAME NIGHT to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) Your roommate is murdered. She is persecuted by the murderer, whom she knows, does not report to the university or the police, then leaves school to go home to visit her parents. Then she returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let the past be passed and will not try to kill her, even though she knows her secret. She, of course, was wrong. <br /> <br /> For someone who was supposed to be so smart (she was studying to be a doctor at the best school in Germany), she acted like the bimbo cliché in a horror. movie. <br /> <br /> These things made a potentially good movie very frustrating, and made me wish the ending would come even earlier. Halfway through the movie, I stopped looking for her and wished she would also end up at the dissection table.
