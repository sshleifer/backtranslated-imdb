"De Dominee" is based on the life of a true Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma. In the movie, it's called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that the events presented in the film have something to do with what really happened. But that really does not matter! Because he could not get my attention! This movie bores me a lot! It lacks substance and style! The substantial part could have been forgiven if the performance was good and if the director tried to do something original. Without the substance, at least you have to bring some style or decent action. Do not we need to be entertained? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster films! It is obvious that he did not! Otherwise, I would not have done this as he did! This movie received a lot of publicity due to a small scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie! Without him, "De Dominee" would never have succeeded! I'm sure of that!
