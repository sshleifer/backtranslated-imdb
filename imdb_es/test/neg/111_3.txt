This cheap and grainy Italian film is about a couple of heirs of a mansion in the Italian countryside who are heading to the house to stay, and then they are killed by ghosts of people murdered in that house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed by this. Actually, it was not so scary, especially as it should be a cheap Italian movie. A girl, her two cousins ​​and a cousin's girlfriend, go to this huge house for some reason (I could not understand why) and they stay there, cleaning and checking the place. The characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty boring at some points, and most of the deaths are pretty fast. The bride is hit by a car when she runs away from the house after having dreamed of her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then things get slow again, until a confused end, when the male cousins ​​kill each other together strange way, and this weird guy (I could not figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I do not remember him) goes after this girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him. I hate to give the end, but good. The cousin decides to stay in the house and watch over her, and they show scenes of her life there years later. The end. You're really not missing anything, and anyway, you probably will not find this anywhere, so you're lucky.
