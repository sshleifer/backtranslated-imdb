"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard." I just can not believe that this movie was made, and much less distributed. Someone at Universal Studios thought that people would see and like this "movie". The only good thing about this is that Ice-T is the owner. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in movies is to accelerate the action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special fast-moving effect. The director must be prohibited from making films forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
