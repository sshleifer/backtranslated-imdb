This movie really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is only ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children that this film does not show. <br /> <br /> The "Indian parents" are guilty of the following: a. Destroying the individuality of children making them completely dependent on parents at a very young age. Such children grow up to be adults only in physical appearance but they are still children in mind. Since their great Indian parents have provided them with everything, children do not automatically feel the need to work hard on something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings other than their parents. <br /> <br /> SECOND. I can show you to so many Indian parents who try to prevent their children from making friends, leaving or preventing them from doing something that makes them grow as adults. <br /> <br /> The reason why they do it is the same. selfishness. Indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them when they grow up. They do not save anything by themselves and once they reach 50 years of age ... They scream VERY WELL ...... Now we have aged and, therefore, we depend on you, children, since we have performed the GREAT SERVICE to give to this world and taking care of yourself and making you intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents at the age of 50 have body and health in disrepair and are financially completely insecure. Most feel that ABSOLUTELY do not need to take care of themselves since they "expect" their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> In the west the opposite happens. People begin to plan their retirement at the age of 20 and, once they retire, they are financially secure. <br /> <br /> Indian parents do NOT do ANYTHING of that type, because as I said, they have brought children to the world and what better. Investment in that? <br /> <br /> I am a victim of my Indian parents (I am sure there are many other Indian children like me), who have grown physically but are still struggling with their lives in THEIR OWN and continue to bother the young people of 50 years screaming for HELP all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only ONE side of the story ...
