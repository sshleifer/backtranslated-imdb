Perhaps the target audience of this Disney Channel TV film is satisfied with that, but if one of the parents observes them along with the children, they will clearly see that "everything is fine" is written throughout this production. Obviously, it was not anyone's dream to make this film, but it was invented in a boardroom somewhere and then it was produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas do not have the opportunity to show their talent. The incredibly pretty Elisabeth Harnois is getting involved as the First Daughter, but Will Friedle is again caught playing another silly character, although he is not as dumb and annoying as in his role "Boy Meets World". The background of this film is Washington, DC and the White House, but the film does not have a really "presidential" feel and the Secret Service is made to be a little better than the Keystone Kops when it comes to doing their duty. Disney Channel presents many original TV movies and most of them are better than this.
