Ram Gopal Verma usually makes a regular price of cookie cutter formula, taken from some Hollywood movie. Each of his films after Shiva is in the cookie genre. Every once in a while, he makes a really horrible movie like this. <br /> <br /> During the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a problem gymnast posing as an expert dancer (imagine!) and an aspiring actor trying to get rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes a hero, the dancer / gymnast has no rest, gymnastics, anguish, habitual anguish, more gymnastics, anguish, singing, dance, anguish, something more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you give yourself account, re slept fast And this in spite of the body HOT, ATTRACTIVE, HOT SEX, of the best lady and gymnast and dancer. <br /> <br /> But you are not alone! The editor, director, photographer, in fact, all the cast and crew are asleep throughout the production. The only difference is that they were paid to postpone while paying the money for this shit, so you lose. Ha, the joke is on you. Do not feel sorry for yourself, but for our poor shattered girl, as she tones daily in her high-rise penthouse with the sexiest tights and exercise. Puh-leese, when will the poor woman get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG ?! <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can not act. RGV has lost its marbles. Abhishek tried hard but failed. There is no plot. There is no history Nothing. She must have paid RGV generously to do these nonsense things in addition to the free gym classes on her casting couch. What a super deal. There is no need for a career as an actor. <br /> <br /> That absolute rubbish can only be "made in Bollywood" of course!
