Hellraiser: Bloodline is just a regular movie. I think it's the fourth installment of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there were some topless women and a box-shaped thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the information button) I soon discovered that the villain (Pinhead) was released from the Pandora's Box, which, I believe, is a direct access door to hell. <br /> <br /> So Anyway, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the family of the "Toy Maker". And that's it. Oh, and without mentioning the random tortures of several people who cross his path. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What happens mainly in this movie is that Pinhead captures the child, and then releases the dog over his wife, and then kills a person at random. Then the husband comes, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why it fails is because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too corny to be scary. Look at Pinhead's creature servant: a cheesy dog ​​that seems to have been scrambled, two men whose heads and bodies are connected to each other (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And someone who is supposed to be a princess of some order. (I have not seen the previous movies.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Is not that the name you call someone when he's stupid? He has pins on his head and hooks that come out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I guess he would be a decent villain if he did not have such a cheesy name and a cheesy speech. Somewhere in the movie, two policemen approach him and say "Do not make us feel bad!" Pinhead responds: "Pain? How dare you use that word? I AM pain?" blah, blah, blah blah blah It sounds a bit cliché if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and the audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks a futuristic asylum. Someone we do not recognize (maybe it was in the previous films, I do not remember it at the beginning of the movie). This scene is basically one thing that plays over and over again: <br /> <br /> A guard is going to inspect a mysterious noise. <br /> <br /> Some other guard: "Oh no, it's down, I'm going to check it on my own!" <br /> <br /> Then the same thing that happens again dies. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here is what I did not understand. In the movie, Pinhead is supposedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So, how do you come back for four other movies? Are they prequels? Why has not he died in the previous ones? Gee Creators must have an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is bloody and full of torture scenes, but it has little emotion or fear value. Just forget it. Bad special effects with bad everything else makes it more a dream party than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Well, some people can enjoy topless women at the beginning. Also, the voice of Pinhead is very good. I suppose if you like ultra violence, you may also like this. <br /> <br /> Bad: none of the above reasons make this a very good movie. Corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And who names his villain Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.
