With Pep Squad receiving an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, it is not surprising that Steve Balderson slanders this website. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a black "bad comedy" (both words in quotes for a reason). It's a film full of excessive action (Cherry, Beth's mother), along with a couple of lethargic performances (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A film in which you can follow cars at a distance of twenty feet in a striking red Jeep and you will never be seen. A film full of not so appealing necklines and nudity shots that make you wonder: "Does the director think this is funny? Or smart?" Above all, the characters are as thin as paper and are so poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can not decide whether to be a comedy, a drama or a satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing in any school position (being Prom Queen) crosses the line to madness (not to mention the burning of flags and shootings from vehicles, a poor attempt to be controversial and irritable ), and fails to be a comedy, for all the jokes forced and uncomfortably located (big butt mom, black director "funky", and excessive comments by the main cast). Seeing the documentary "Wamego: Making movies anywhere" just made this film more praiseworthy, with praise praised by ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. It's not a black comedy, or anything like that. I guess Kansas will have to wait.
