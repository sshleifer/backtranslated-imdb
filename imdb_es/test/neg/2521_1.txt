It's hard to criticize a movie with the title as 'The deathbed: the bed you eat' and it involves a ghost narrator who is trapped behind a two-way picture that he drew and a bed that snores and ... If I do not I'm wrong, he masturbates. (Now, that's back to your human companions!) Also, foam (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb the edibles that are on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Suffice it to say do not expect too much when you see what I assume is stomach acid. The final remains of whatever the orange foam carries? Dissolving only certain things. He will drink the wine, but the bottle is fine and he will eat the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. Heck, the bed even replaces the unused containers. Hilariously, at one point he drops Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at that. I do not think they really want you to take this seriously. It is low budget and it is extremely easy to see where they cut costs and save large amounts of money. I thought, in a world where there may be a 'Rising' and a 'Blood Beach', this 'Deathbed' could be fun to watch. For reasons that might involve a cost, 90% of the movie is a voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fear / confusion about why I would attack a bed (can I think of one? And I was never one of those people ). children who jumped on the bed) and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (A victim loses all the flesh in their hands, just says "ay"). Only one scene, which lasted too long, was meticulously tense? A woman tries to crawl just to be dragged back, using a leaf. Where are the MST3k guys?
