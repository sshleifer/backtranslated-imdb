I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was in Video Ezy in Miranda with my family in a monthly tradition of video hiring. It was at this time that I summoned the courage to venture into the horror section of the store. Navigating through the various titles, I finally found Jack Frost. The cover was enough to convince me that the movie was beyond my visual pleasures. Years later, the film disappeared, only to be replaced by the inevitable but unnecessary sequel. Once again I ventured into the horror section and picked up the case only to come to a conclusion: would the movie be scary? but not intentionally. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost 2: Revenge Of The Killer Mutant Snowman (a title) continues where his predecessor left him. Sheriff Sam is looking for counseling after his hard tests and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape from his past, Sam and his wife head to a hotel on the island where he finds himself in the company of a wide variety of nuanced film stereotypes, including busty female models, athletic athletes and Caribbean staff. However, Jack leaves his liquid tomb and returns to his frozen methods. He goes to the island and proceeds to kill anyone who shows an amazing death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this is a direct movie to the video, so it's probably bad. But this is terrible even in the eyes of other top movies. The work of the camera is deficient, using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic. Half of the actors seem to have come out of a porn filming and the other half seems to have left a retirement home, but they have actually left an asylum. There is an extensive use of the special effects used in the movie that tends to alternate between soft puppets and CGI that can be improved by a child, and the death scenes are almost all off the screen and show us little of what It has happened to the unfortunate, but it deserves victims But the film is more memorable, since it is one of the first phrases of the type "There is something that needs a little Christmas stuffing" and "I know I declare you officially dead!" Ultimately, the whole purpose behind a movie like this is to make a popcorn movie for those boredom Friday nights and even that fails. To make a sequel to a movie that was a bad slasher with a concept that a child would find incredible must have taken some nerves of steel? or a total frontal lobotomy. To the director Michael Cooney? Thanks for wasting my time. To everyone else ?? Avoid as arsenic.
