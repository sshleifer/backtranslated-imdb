I went to see him suspecting that I would hate him, I did. Everything was wrong; It was as if they were filming a different book. Granted the places and the houses very charming (if not a little bad, yes, even the house was bad for its parts) Keira was too modern, boring and frankly I found it unpleasant to see her. When everyone else sees Darcy as a sexual god, the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and disheveled (he is not meant to be) and it was shown that Bennett's were destitute and, for some unknown reason, farmers, this is wrong and ridiculous. The mere thought of Mr. Bennett answering the door in his night clothes with the rest of the family dressed in his underwear in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and greasy, just stupid and hateful, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley was wearing a sleeveless dress, what? Like! It is historically inaccurate and even the end is unsatisfactory. I could continue for days. I hated it so much because not only did it not look anything like the book, but I am afraid that for many people it will be their first experience with this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so superior that it is not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to your memory. In short, if you must see it, make sure you have read the book first or seen the BBC version; otherwise, it will be the leader in making the way deceptive. That's how it is, and it's not like that!
