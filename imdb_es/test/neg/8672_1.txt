Please ... if anyone has the opportunity to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if you can call it that, refrain from doing it ... do not waste your time! I also saw this movie right after finishing the book, and I was very disappointed ... the main character is basically a new one invented by Fanny, since it does not look like the book at all ... she is very cheerful and smiling all the time ... if there was something that the author wanted to put into practice was that he was a very shy and introverted character ... please! All the most important parts of the story, which are supposed to be transmitted at the end of the hippy, are simply not taken into account ... and the rest was invented! I think it's better to use the time to read a bit of the real novel or just do nothing.
