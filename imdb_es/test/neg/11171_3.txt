It is really sad to see a great director like Deodato deliver a second class giallo like this. This movie was so terrible that it effectively ended his film career. The box lies, this is not an "erotic thriller", hell during the 97 minutes of the film, Charlotte Lewis just shows us a nipple! I thought that he would recover once William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed in a rather abrupt and weak manner. This movie fails in almost every way. The music of Claudio Simonetti is little more than noise, and the plot had very little meaning. For some reason, Lewis is terrified of ghosts that attack using phones. (?) In the end, all the characters seem to have forgotten about the last 90 minutes of hell that happened, and they laugh casually while they sicken the evil spirits of another person, Lewis' ex-boyfriend. What?!? This movie did little for me, besides getting angry ... and it bored me almost to death. To enjoy the fun of Deodato in the 80s, watch THE BARBARIANS or THE ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let it rot on the shelf of the video store. Argento could make a better giallo than this one!
