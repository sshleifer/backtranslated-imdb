Sometimes a movie can not be easily classified. Such a film is "Tank Girl", partly caricature, partly comedy and partly in action. I'm sure there's an audience for "Tank Girl" somewhere, but it's extremely small, maybe punk comic readers. Most viewers will look for an early exit or live with the fast forward button. The only exchange quality is short bursts of humor "I find a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these small moments of comic relief are far surpassed by the action sequences of sophomoricism. There is no character development, which is not surprising, since the source is a comic. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - MERK
