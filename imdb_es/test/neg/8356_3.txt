I have a question for the writers and producers of "Prozac Nation": What is the root cause and what is the solution to the generalized problem of personal depression in the United States? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a success story, only one of self-destruction to see Liz bring misery to the lives of all who come in contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness. But none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz should take responsibility for her life and her problems. No light was thrown on what the film is supposedly a runaway problem in "The United States Depression." In the story, Liz had a humanitarian therapist (Anne Heche), a careful roommate (Michele Williams), a sympathetic boyfriend (Jason Biggs) and a worried but worried mother (Jessica Lange). In a key scene from the movie, Liz is lying on a hospital bed observing the breakdown of the space shuttle Challenger. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for her recovery and recovery. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of a generic "victim" movie made by cable. The network for life. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the serious performance of Christina Ricci. Real life, Elizabeth Wurtzel, obviously found in herself the resources to face her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest vision of his courageous spirit.
