Jim Wynorski attacks again with the very literal mentality of KOMODO VS. COBRA. There are no guesses here. A CGI giant komodo dragon, which looks like a kind of fur without a dog, faces a gigantic CGI cobra, with a group of tree handles and others trapped. The tree thieves get the captain of the charter boat Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to a forbidden federal island. An experiment done by a mad scientist in the cultivation of very large vegetables has become an experiment in the growth of very large creatures, thanks to our nutty military man. Now all that remains on the island are the very large creatures and the tiny and well-formed daughter of the mad scientist. The group meets her in the old plantation laboratory, the monsters arrive and the chase is underway. If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel movies, you will recognize some of the locations and locations of many other movies. Acting is non-existent, as is the plot. At the very least, you can enjoy watching the victim / dog mischievously stomp on their victims before scaring them. The cobra just hits and swallows. There is no imagination at all.
