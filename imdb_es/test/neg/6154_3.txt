I'm not sure I bought that argument entirely, but Slipstream is evidence that supports the theory; It's a cowboy movie with airplanes. <br /> <br /> Actually it's better than that. It's a Spagetti Western with planes! It replaces airplanes with horses, turns the android into a priest and this film would be indistinguishable from any of a dozen "Italians" of shooting with "Italian Italian semi-artistic pretensions of the 70s. The film is not as bad as I had been. I did believe for some of the reviews I had read here, but it certainly was not good.
