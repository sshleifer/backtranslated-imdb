I had to read "I know why caged birds sing" in my English class and we watched the movie after finishing it. After watching the movie, I regret having seen it. It completely removed the impact that the book had. The scenes did not make sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed as if the writer of the screen had never picked up the book, but had opted for the notes of the cliff. I was outraged at the way the movie ended. Almost half of the book was cut and certain aspects were extremely important for the growth of Maya as a person. If you've read ... Caged Birds, this movie will ruin the book experience, so I warn you not to see it.
