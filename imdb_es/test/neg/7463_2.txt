The attic starts well. The two main actors greatly help the sad story, but here it seems that a character is being studied, but the movie goes downhill quickly when the character of Carrie Snodgress buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a really big chimp! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device basically kills the movie. It is simply not conceivable for a woman like the one who plays Snodgress, who has difficulty doing something because of her dominant father, so that she, out of the blue, buys a chimpanzee. Well then! Forget this!
