I loved blood and blood. The type of violence is what the films of Alien and Predator, of which nobody is freed, deal with. This really answers the question of what it would be like if the aliens were on Earth. The answer to that is simple. We are screwed. The effects were beautiful. However, there are some real problems with this. <br /> <br /> 1) The performance was horrible on the side of the human characters that almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring that was what really interrupted the flow of the film and was very annoying. The writers could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the performance of Alien and Predator, which in my opinion was very well done. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than that of the first AvP movie. This I scratched my head in. <br /> <br /> 3) The predators that have their mask while they are still on the ship. This bothers people and I can not understand why. It is not a plot hole as most people do it to be. So I tell them to calm down. It's not a big deal. If it makes you feel better, remember, they had bored in the face and were bored in storage, so that could be a good reason for that. <br /> <br /> 4) Predator fires its plasma launcher inside the ship. I thought that was pretty stupid on the part of the Predators. But then I started thinking if it was a younger predator that panicked. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son came almost instantaneously to the crash site after it fell several miles away. At least they did not bore us by showing them running through the forest for 30 minutes. so be happy with that. <br /> <br /> 6) Why only one Predator left? I thought that this was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just a Predalien with whom he was dealing and not an outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why did not the Predators self-destruct on the ship? Well, if people paid attention, one did, but they killed him before he could activate it completely. <br /> <br /> 8) Unlimited blue fusion goo. I thought that was pretty silly. <br /> <br /> 9) The predator hid evidence with the goo, but he stays with a policeman. That was also silly. <br /> <br /> 10) The blackout. Well, people, an Alien and Pred fought at a power station. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien is half granny / queen. This really angered me. I'm a fan of Alien and Pred. I know for a fact that foreigners do not do that! Just as they do not give birth as a human being does, as they showed in Alien4! Of all the comics, games, books and movies 1,2 and 3, it clearly shows his behavior. They need a queen to lay the eggs, the eggs become the infected host of the one with the face, the one with the face, the parasite appears and kills the host and becomes a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator and Runner with any type of four-legged animal. And then, after living for years and years, they move to a Preatorian (a mini-queen who does not lay eggs) that I can go on and on, but I do not. But that single scene almost ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart, they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infect pregnant women. <br /> <br /> Either way, if you're going to watch this movie, go see it for Aliens and Predators. And when the scene appears in which Predalin infects pregnant women ... Close your eyes to avoid having to see that insult to the universe Alien and Pred.
