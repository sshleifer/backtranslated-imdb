This could have been a good movie for television, but flashbacks do not make it easy to understand the movie. As they give the viewer information about the way (the movie will proceed) I found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that at the beginning. Then, probably the whole trail would not have been necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why he shot and, of course, he is not guilty. Too bad the producer / director used the flashbacks in this way, but on the other hand, the film would not have been worth it at all. <br /> <br /> Good movie for a rainy day, lots of chips to kill the night.
