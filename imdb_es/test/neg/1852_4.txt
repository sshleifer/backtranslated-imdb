Michael Caine usually appears in very good ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without A Pue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or in really bad comedies ("Noises Off", "Death becomes in his "," Harry and Walter go to NY "). This falls into the last category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that succeeds in only two things: getting wasted a cast that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, all of whom have comedy skills, and succeed in their mission is not make the spectator laugh There is not a truly fun moment here. The main reason is bad writing; So much useless effort was made to write an intricately intricate story that is simply too annoying to follow (considering it's just a comedy) that the writer (s) forgot to do the damn funny thing, which, as far as I can remember, is what It's supposed to be the point of a comedy. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this Moron before. Some people even say "if you're a Moron fan, you'll love this" blah blah blah. A fan of Moron? Does this indescribable person really have fans? A comedy as badly written as this requires a mega talent to laugh once or twice, someone like Steve Coogan and not your average Moron. <br /> <br /> If you're going to do a comedy about the actors, at least make them to be the absolute idiots they usually are. The characters of Caine and Moron are not foolish enough. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this collection of funny scenes is the girl. Only a truly horrible writer would think that to give life to a lousy script it is advisable to include a super intelligent wise child. Smart-a ** kids are not even funny anymore for Bill Cosby fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a totally normal child and she was very funny. This stupid children's character is smarter than adults, it belongs to a century-old Marx Brothers movie.
