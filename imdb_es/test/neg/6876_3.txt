Yes, that title line really appears in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually said, did not somebody laugh at the crew that was filming? I would have liked to see the shots of this movie, mainly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Directed by director Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer,") comes a teen movie that seems to assume we've never seen a teen movie before. Of course, he should not be blamed. There are also three responsible writers, and this is based in some way on a video game that is still in production. The title of this game is "Backwater", but when looking for information I found absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we started the movie ... I would like to say before continuing. I did not expect this to win an Oscar. When I'm in the right mindset, I enjoy a funny horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original and intelligent slasher movie. "Venom" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. It's okay. You do not wait much. However, instead of a cast of a few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many clich√© characters from horror movies ... <br /> <br /> 1. The Final Girl: She just broke up with her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the movie, when they are in danger, they will decide to be together again. Which probably means that he will die and that she will be the last survivor of the movie. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I might add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: He is about to coexist with The Final Girl until his death. Of course, he can save her, but he is condemned and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: In general, horror films only feel the need for one of these, but here we have two. They steal, they steal, they can show their breasts (not in this case) or they can be alcoholics. A basic element of the genre. They also wander through poorly lit areas alone, usually saying things like, "Hello, is there someone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", suitably named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Sure, it looks nice, but it's the idiot in the movie that is inserted simply to be an idiot. He says stupid things, he does stupid things, he's obviously never seen a horror movie, and it's one of the nice deaths that you see this kind of thing. "Sean" is interpreted by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The girlfriend: She loves the Jackass although almost nobody else does, and usually she is the one who stays alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts to stumble and stay behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. Enough talk. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think you understand the image. The remaining characters are not as common as they are equally slavable. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") that was definitely stolen in terms of screen time, and "The One Who Knows What Going On". Of course, none of that matters, because at the beginning everyone always thinks he's crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of other characters, namely a deputy played by Method Man, but he and others are eliminated quite quickly and get a character development even less than the following cliches. <br /> <br /> So, you're probably thinking, "Why does this movie require such deep analysis? It's just a summer horror movie, to cry out loud!" Based on that question, do you deliver the merchandise? Yes and no. The acting is not particularly convincing, even considering the amount of talent involved. Bijou Phillips was acclaimed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been a promising talent for a while. <br /> <br /> So, what about the gore? There is something. That is really about that. Many of the juiciest bits are cuts. That is, a scene that involves someone's face and a sandblast that is used to remove the paint from the cars. <br /> <br /> For the filmmaker's credit, there are a couple of interesting scenes. I liked the part where a part of the house was literally torn so that the unstoppable villain could reach the characters. <br /> <br /> If all this had centered on a more intelligent script in which the characters did nothing. the same stupid mistakes that literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them, could have been a more pleasant experience. All the most interesting characters are removed immediately in the first third of the movie and then it becomes a not very interesting countdown until we know they are only The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I guess I must be a little tired, but as a horror movie fan, I wonder why I should have been upset when I could have written a better script. I will not even mention the numerous cases of terrible CGI.
