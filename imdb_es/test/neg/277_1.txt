I was watching this movie and I got increasingly bored with the absurd plot that was not going anywhere, when suddenly, the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor who plays herself. Oh, how I laughed. Because it's very funny, is not it? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess, and here they are, in the movie, joking that Tess's character looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone pretending to be Julia. How well does this, we will never know, because 99.999% of the audience does not know Julia Roberts personally (and read about it in the Hello magazine does not count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis appears! Apparently, he is Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how would he know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other or not? I am not interested in the least in the personal life of the actors; I only pay my money and I hope that they do the work for which they are paid. Anyway, they start telling jokes about the plot twist in the movie where Willis (quite unconvincing) plays a psychiatrist ... the one who has the little boy ... you know which one? I do not, I forgot what it's called. Willis even drops a comment about how well the movie did at the box office: how modest, Mr. Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is that these scenes are not only useless and horribly horribly self-indulgent. They also remind viewers that we are simply watching a group of actors strut and collect large sums of money for very little effort. You see, when I watch a movie, I want to suspend the disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors, I want to believe in the story I'm seeing. When you start to tear down the stage, in the middle of the movie, you simply ruin my illusion. <br /> <br /> You know that a television series has jumped the shark when it begins to introduce the celebrities, to play themselves (stand up and tell the Simpsons, friends, etc.), but this It's the first time I've seen a movie jump the shark. I usually stay away from movies like that (for example, Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that, honestly, I never thought that the 11 Ocean films would go in this direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So with the suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot that now languishes in the movie, it cracks the most perverse joke of the audience: the theft actually happened in the past. History, and the last 90 minutes or so of the movie were useless postures. Yes, that's right: Steven Soder, who is the actor and his actor friends, get up, point us to the audience and say: "Ha haaa ... everyone has had ... Thanks for your money!". Then they give us the greeting with just one finger. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll give it back to you. Actually I did not pay to see this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do apples like? Now that is a plot twist.
