I have to add a comment to this one !!! <br /> <br /> First, ironically, one has to add the "spolier alert" to fit the IMDb parameters, but here there is absolutely nothing that can "spoil". br /> <br /> There are six characters: the pretty girl whose A-list mountain guide is in the "climbing" area and apparently among all the guides (including Mount Everest Sherpas) on the planet; his lost love, which disappeared from the pass titled two years before, to whom he supposedly seeks the party, but never finds; her friend, owner of a store, also a guide, who can be better than a Sherpa but who has no rival for her; the strange leading actress who looks after her services and says that they will find their lost love in the deal; his only associate, a hacker with supposedly unlimited experience, of a sufficient level so that Gates can ask for his advice; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who apparently has an IQ that does not reach three digits. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are nefarious events, and the secret search of the main actor is to recover the ability a satellite that has fallen in the "Step" and has unique data and that change the world to bring them an incalculable wealth . Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> Overacting abounds, the script looks like something that could get a C- in a freshman writing class (but an F if it's presented at a higher level), and the spirits gnaw every piece of landscape like a horde of beavers. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting aspects of this film were the parts juxtaposed with three other films or papers that I have seen. <br /> <br /> First, The secret, mysterious and undisclosed data, make remember "The Spanish prisoner", an A-list / Mamet movie, which surrounds a valuable corporate "process", never specifically clarified, but it's better for that. It is definitely not like that here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the lead cookie proved to be even more ingenious than that of "Rambo" when dealing quickly when threatened later in the presentation. <br /> <br /> Third, I remember Steven Seagal's movie (I do not remember the title) in which he was semi-conscious and fell asleep for about a third of the time, and was completely in a coma for another 1/3 Although I have not sought to see much of his work, I have seen enough to have noticed that, while in a coma, he provided the best job he has ever had, and is more in line with his laconic person. In this opus, while awake, the young hacker may have been the most attractive personality on screen, but while he was indisposed and incapacitated during the last part, and unable to emote, he provided the best performance during these two seemingly endless hours. /> <br /> Take the thin and stupid base for a plot here. Imagine being compressed into, say, a bit in SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in all four roles. You could get record laughs with little change in the dialogue here. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect in the last analysis is to contemplate what information could have been on the spy satellite to be worth "even billions" for any of many nations, and yet they become useless ( according to the guru's hacker) if they simply place themselves on the Internet, with no apparent consequences thereafter? Even a turkey like this should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere. This is totally devoid.
