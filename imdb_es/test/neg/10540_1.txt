The best thing about the film is the name, since it describes the plot and the performance. At least they can not say they did not warn you ... Something like the button labeled "Do not push this." <br /> <br /> Segal must have run out of things that move like airplanes, trains. , and the ships but the plot remains the same. Concealed, a guy who struggles slowly, but still beats like 40 types of mercenaries and does not even blink when he does. What surprises me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and that the bad guys still can not hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 ammo clips. Where do all these bullets go? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples free Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins does not sound that punk) on the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot on her shoulder like that ... especially with a suit like that! It was only an advantage to see Jeffy receive a kick and fun waiting for one of those kicks to land. Sorry, it's about time we got stupid, the tough guy can not make rappers come out of the movies. PLEASE! Who came up with the idea anyway? I think it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels. <br /> <br /> The only surprising twist in this movie is that they do not do the right thing politically and have Jeffy come and save the day. There is no doubt that Snoop (also known by his mother as Calvin Broadus, who again does not sound so good when you refer to him as Cal) had been in the movie, would throw some signs at him and probably saved Segal's life or some thing.
