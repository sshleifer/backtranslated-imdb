On the way home from a day at the beach, four young men seek refuge from a torrential downpour at the home of Lord and Lady Alexander after their car runs out of fuel. They do not know it, but the house they are staying in is the place of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, will be sacrificed. When his male companions come to his aid, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things really get out of control and everyone who attends the black mass is also killed. The four try to escape, but soon discover that there is no escape from what they have witnessed. One by one, they fulfill their destinies. <br /> <br /> Gong at the Tragic Ceremony, I was sure I would enjoy it. Gothic horror of slow burning is in my alley. I also really like some of Riccardo Freda's other films like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampiri. The Tragic Ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work as they should. The biggest tragedy regarding the Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this mess of a movie. With some minor exceptions, nothing about the movie appealed to me or worked for me. The characters are unpleasant, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the rhythm is terrible. There is a secondary plot about some damn pearls that is not going anywhere and only serves to confuse things even more. Also, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. When the four drivers realized they were in danger, the point of care had already passed. And I do not understand the criticisms that I have read that praise the performance of Camille Keaton. I suppose it is an excellent performance if you consider that a daze without emotion is acting. The three male drivers are the same definition of non-descriptive. They do nothing to excel. The cast includes some of the favorite genres such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but none has anything to do with it. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film that tries to explain what happened in the last 80 minutes. It is a weak attempt to provide a recapitulation of a very weak film.
