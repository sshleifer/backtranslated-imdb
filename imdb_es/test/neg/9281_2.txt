This was one of the programs I wanted to follow up on. But, I just could not devote my time to this show. To have a program that focuses on the subject of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to improve the mood of the program, something like "The West Wing" or "Commander-in-Chief". Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler just could not act (it was horrible in "Early Edition"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With its lack of suspense, urgency and characters that can really act, I simply had to give up this program and I'm glad it was canceled to have nothing more to lose. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
