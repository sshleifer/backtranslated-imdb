If you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you while you sleep, your little daughter talks to ghosts, looking for your lost son in a mine abandoned in the night, so petrified by fear that you can not move even though the blood of a murderous victim drips on you from the floor of above ?? Then I would say that you had a horror movie. But somehow, 'Wicked Little Things' just was not scary. I'm a terror fan and I loved the location, the plot of the director and I liked the three main ladies. I did not want to see them hurt, I wanted the "bad boy" to get his just desserts, the rest of the cast are just cannon fodder, so I was indifferent to them and played on every clich√©. the book - even until the torch's battery runs out in the darkness of the tone just when you start here, whispering voices approaching you. <br /> <br /> I would still recommend that you look at it, but unless you are new. For horror movies or under 12, you've seen it all before.
