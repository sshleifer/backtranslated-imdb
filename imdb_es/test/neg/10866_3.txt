Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not looking good EVEN IN THIS movie, it's like a drug for women in their twenties. <br /> <br /> It has been said that many movies are sexist, but in your case the movie deserves that title is this. <br /> <br /> I can not even count how many boobs were shown in this movie, probably more than an hour that Larry Bishop spent writing the script. <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, the bishop and his gang discuss, ride a bicycle, party, have sex, kill people and the next day they argue, ride a bicycle, party, have sex sexual, kill people and the third day, well, understand the idea. /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and considering what he had to work with, he did quite well as a comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is about the character of Larry Bishop, Gunman, who is so one-dimensional that he is not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to take the initiative, but everyone he asked, no, what was he going to do? Once he realized that he was going to take the initiative himself, he probably did a rewrite of the script to be able to touch up more ladies. <br /> <br /> Although he is visually handsome, at least the biker-scenes and Eric Balfour is not bad at all. This movie is just a big disaster. <br /> <br /> I hope I'll never see Larry Bishop again in front of the camera.
