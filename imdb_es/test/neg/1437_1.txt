I do not recommend that you watch this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even easily offended and this movie frustrated me. It's so gross. And it does not make sense. Everything related to the Internet is so clich√©, and the producer obviously did not understand all the "Internet rules". When you chat with someone, you can trace their IP address. Really? (see the sarcasm here). It was useless fool. And I did not even see the end. You could always say "this does not make sense, this does not either ..." This movie is pure shit at its best. Good comment, right?
