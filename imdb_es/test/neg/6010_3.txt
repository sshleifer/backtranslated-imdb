For producer David O. Selznick, no director would. Therefore, in "Adi√≥s a las armas" (1957), do we get two? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Even though both men were quite successful on their own, neither of them could become the head or tail of this disastrous remake of Hemmingway's masterpiece. In general, Hemmingway never translated well from one book to another. But under Selznick's zeal to transform it into his next 'Gone With The Wind', the tour is both punitive and exhaustive. At this point in Selznick's career, it was no longer the titan who could take the "box office poison" and transform it into Gone with the Wind. Tired, fragile, without his study, and, with the imminent feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones could have been a mistake, Selznick handed over the creative reigns of this film to Fox Studios. but he kept enough of himself to become a damn nuisance on the set. <br /> <br /> By now, one or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones). and his soldier hero, Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). It is assumed that his passion is the stabilizing force of what is essentially the story of a war correspondent with romanticism launched to a large extent. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and boring. In the last roll, Jones' facial contortions during delivery are so bad that I am surprised that none of the directors chose to eliminate them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she is too wise to play the optimist Catharine with great conviction. However, older actresses have often managed to make a hearing forget about discrepancies in age. Not so with Jones. One of them is painfully aware that it does not fit into the bill or the action chops or the years spent on this planet. The laconic charm of Hudson has no contact with the stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but the head is still strong. The cast of support is dotted with luminaries such as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but they are waste of nonsense that in no way reflects the formidable talents of any of the actors and that are more evident in their filming canons. <Br /> <br /> The anamorphic image element for "Goodbye to Arms" looks good enough, although there is too little film grain in certain scenes for this critic's taste. In general, the colors are subtle and off, although they are balanced according to the DeLuxe color processing used at this time. Some fading is evident. The skin tones do not seem very natural. The contrast levels are a bit weak. Blacks are generally solid. The whites are almost clean. There is not much to recommend this movie sonically. It is essentially a neat image with shots as a background. There are no extras.
