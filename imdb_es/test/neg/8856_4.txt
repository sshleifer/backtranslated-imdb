Well, this movie is really "PLUMPED" HAHA. Get it? That's a bit like the attitude of this movie. The plot is only a copy of Pulp Fiction, it's fine, but to make this piece is "PLUMP" (haha)! it's really amazing. The story is so pathetic, and the whole thing just caused some laughter. He tried to make some jokes from other movies and failed most of the time. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but this is not really the way to laugh. Most of the supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. The movie is quiet, of short duration, around 75 minutes in total. They could have done a much more fun job, apparently they made fun of a very successful movie, they were betting, eh! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> In general, PLUMP Fiction is "PLUMPABLE", but you will not get much! <br /> <br /> Is it worth seeing again and again ?: No, once is enough, it is really more than enough! <br /> <br /> So, is it worth the rent? Ummm ... Like I said, it's "PLUMPABLE", but you'll just pick up some "PLUMPS" from it! <br /> <br /> In general, from 10: to 4 of 10!
