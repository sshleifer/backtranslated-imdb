This was at SciFi last weekend, and I had to check it out. After all ... it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this movie B? <br /> <br /> A lot. <br /> <br /> To begin with: You can not even classify it as a "B movie", because that would put you in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie does not even meet your expectations. The most money they spent was on contact lenses for vampires. <br /> <br /> Second: the launch was horrible. Yes, choosing Udo Kier as the Demeter's captain was a smart move ... but the director clearly could not make Kier memorize his lines. Eleniak's casting, in a vampire movie, is also an intelligent move because it means that a group of horny dudes will buy / rent / record this movie to see how a vampire seduces her. But, the director, writer and producer was wrong too. Granted, they got some money from the poor and unfortunate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with attractive women in them ... but nobody will remember this movie in another two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: small things that only emphasize laziness in this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross a "crucifix" and, when Mina is stationed in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that his "chest" is nothing but pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing: why did they opt for the George Hamiltion type Dracula instead of something that would look decently terrifying? Does George Hamilton have an overwhelming grip on our future? Why could not everyone who saw Dracula laugh at him because of his clothes? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote control in your hand.
