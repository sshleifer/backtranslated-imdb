A friend of mine, who is more involved in the cult films of the 70s than me, recommended it to me and, in fact, gave me the copy I saw. However, I was not as excited about the result as he was? Or, for that matter, Michael Elliott ?? I was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and THE CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): in fact, I would dare to say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of the previous one much more than the "original". ! So, we have a remote and abandoned Wax Museum of incredibly realistic mannequins (guess why?) With his seemingly harmless healer (a hammy Chuck Connors) being "invaded" by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers (including Tanya Roberts). He also has a crazy brother? Shadows of PSYCHO (1960) incorporated for a good measure, up to the same turn. who is supposed to be a mechanical genius (exhibited in a 'poltergeist' that inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from a Donaggio Pine score but, being so derivative and not especially well made to boot, it essentially ends up simply as a redundant (and quite confusing) gender effort.
