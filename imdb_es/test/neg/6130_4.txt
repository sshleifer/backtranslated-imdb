Before continuing, I must admit that I only saw the first episode of this program. If I had time, I could have considered seeing it every week, just to see how the season developed. However, from the beginning it was very clear to me that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" simply does not "fit." Martha Stewart made the career of being a happy housewife, a domestic diva like Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. Only from his scandalous legal problems and his subsequent imprisonment, his public image began to reflect the true roughness of his character. Sure, she was convincing for a while, and this whole series raises the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in the business. Does it have to come out so cold and hard? Should not? <br /> <br /> But the truth was that, when Stewart got out of prison, his attempts at public reappearance, although they were certainly justified, were never going to capture the interest of the audience for long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked if she had returned home peacefully and would have waited about a year after they removed the ankle bracelet that used to mock him. Instead, she launched frantically at excess with 2 series at a time, the other was her syndicated daytime series Martha, much like her previous, but more conventional show, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even in its heyday, Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that the American public immediately accept his foray into the reality television. Maybe the United States wants Stewart to return by itself instead of being the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The program was basically a tired retread of Trump's "Apprentice", which still holds my interest, depending on Trump's tasks, cast and dismissal decisions (often controversial, probably because of that reason). The bit of the letter was certainly not a clich√©, but unpleasant in the least. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned on the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. Producer Mark Burnett must be admired for dealing with Stewart's prison honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone who sees can say that she's basically trying to prove she's a good businesswoman. Again, never more conventional, Stewart lacks the kindness and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable and charismatic "hardness" of Donald Trump. Yes, this may be an evaluation biased by the gender of your character, but I want to say that it is more about the nature of your business. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that Stewart has been fired, but I wonder if they really always intended it to last only one season?
