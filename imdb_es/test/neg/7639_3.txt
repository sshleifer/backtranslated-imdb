The lack of character development is fatal for this movie. The character of Valeria Golino, Grazia, begins as a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the fault of the writer, not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the youngest son Filippo: his energy and courage are fun and convincing. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the cruelty of the children should contribute to create an environment of desolation and emphasize the omnipresent primitive spirits. in the city, but for me, gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the general boredom of the film. Some scenes were fun, but they did not intend to be like that, for example, when battered dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and seem ready to show themselves. The beautiful cast and the stage make it an attractive trailer but you can not take the whole movie.
