Having not read the original book or seen the previous movie, and without knowing anything about the history of any of them or the current movie, I came to this film with an open mind. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to know where to start a comment about the movie, because everything seems so confusing. It seems that there is a point or a message or something in the movie, but what is left is completely dark. <br /> <br /> The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was established very well with the motivation to travel in clearly established time. However, it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> The whole journey in time seems to have only the vaguest connection to the search that was established at the beginning. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated events that do not really flow and make the movie seem disconnected and lost. At one point, one wonders if the main story of the movie is the fate of the moon. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives at 802.701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating as he seems unable to discover something of importance. about the Eloi, and although it seems clear that there is something to discover, what is remains annoying and elusive. This is a rather strange change with respect to previous instances of travel in time and one wonders why all this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. Really, I really wanted to know what the movie was about, what to discover, but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this time, there seems to have been a half-hearted attempt to interpret this in the film, but it has been simplified and "silenced" in such a way that the meaning and context are completely different. lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope to finally discover where all this takes us, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction and becomes a meaningless action movie without any real action. It is as if at this point the director had simply stopped bothering to put some meaning into the film. For now countless important things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity to return to the past twice without cause, and suddenly loses all interest in traveling in time for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end when Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi. <br /> <br /> In summary, after a good start, the movie is very disappointing. He spends too much time on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving with Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: the configuration of the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely lost, and this undermines the rest of the movie. After this, the film concentrates too much on the effects and the action, and all the attempts to return to the meaning and the core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the ending where Hartdegen decides he is no longer worried about time travel is the most inexplicable of all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the whole movie looked like a collection of unrelated incidents. The meaning and context were lost, although the huge hole where it should have been was very obvious. However, what was so frustrating about all this was that there was clearly a lot of potential here: in no way was it a bad movie, so easily could it have been much better. The start was very promising, the time travel looked fantastic and would have worked if it had not been fired on tangents, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could have worked so easily if some of the right questions had been asked, and if there would have been no such temptation to "move" and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine to be able to travel back in time and warn against mistakes made.
