I spent almost ninety minutes through this terrible movie waiting for some revelation about the dance or the spirit or the inspiration or something like that and I gave up! What did the filmmakers possess to do this? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To complete a story without a point, we get some things about the other people in your troop, your help to the donkeys and, of course, your ten cats. I do not watch this movie. And have nothing more to do with someone who loved it, they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and perspectives to share, but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people that I take to this movie say that they have forgiven me, but that they will never stop fooling me about it.
