This movie must be one of the most boring and stupid that Perrugorria has ever done. <br /> <br /> It looks like a commercial from start to finish. The "director" spent all the time on a tripod, has no rhythm, rhythm. It is illogical that disaster. You can see what will happen from the first 15 minutes and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how the hell did Perrugorria get shot? Seriously? The worst scene of someone being shot! <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler end ----- <br /> <br /> bad address, bad script, bad performance ... Really bad overall I would not recommend this movie at all. It is a waste of money and time.
