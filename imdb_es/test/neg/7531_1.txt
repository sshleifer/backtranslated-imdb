I watched the movie at its premiere in Lawrence, Kansas. This hesitant story about a group of disgruntled high school students who killed the competition for the prom was simply awful. It fails for many reasons: bad performance, bad script, there is no clear point. But mainly I felt that the filmmakers were saying: "Hey, I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - Without really thinking about it. Unfortunately, most independent films that do not suffer only from that mentality. It seems that they do not realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or in this case, even one that can be seen. With this film I am not ashamed to say that if I did not know some crew members, I would have left. Simple as that.
