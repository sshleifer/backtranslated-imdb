Bled is a very appropriate title for this. By observing it, you will feel that your life bleeds from you. The clich√© of horrors is about people doing exactly what they should not (going down to the basement or going up to the attic). Stay clear Do not enter. And if you need more incentives, this movie? It's as bad as Uwe Boll's worst movie, I mean, The House of the Dead, bad. I have often thought about entering a review of a movie about I.M.D.B. and, after seeing some based on the comments in this document, I discovered that I guess everyone is interested in their opinion. Please trust me in mine
