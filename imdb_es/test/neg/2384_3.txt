Talk about marketing The poster / cover of the video of 'The New Twenty' transmits a half-naked man in a "Video of Wolfe". For those familiar with gay-themed movies? This conveys a "must see". (I loved reading a reviewer (from another site) that indicated that they had been "tricked" into watching a "Sodomita" movie. "Do you mean it?" The motto itself is the word "gay." ??) this, in spite of the amount of gay, stereotyped characters, nothing less (see: the lonely gay, the gay victim of AIDS and the locked gay) is more about the long-term friendship and the characters that separate. In fact, in any case, there are more heterosexual couples (here is one for Christians to complain about) who have sex outside, panting! Not to mention stabbing, excessive consumption and drug use. I see this more as a Logo movie for TV or Showtime than a big screen effort. Sure, I loved the cinematography, some of the actors could act and I always love seeing a large group of friends who actually act as if they had known each other for a million years. But we've seen all this before. Nothing really "new" here. Just an original idea? therefore, come back with the same 'ole' I have AIDS, let's deal with that "for a good part of the film and, boy, our friend has a serious problem with drugs, but do not deal with that until it's almost too late . That's very respectful, like 'Queer as Folk' and 'Broken Hearts Club' (in the US). The film is about a group of friends from the university, who have now grown (in size, not in minds) that eventually have to grow and each one does everything possible while it fails. Strangely, as in most of these independent films, the most interesting, at least for me, was the heaviest, Ben. He stole every scene, but, again, there was not much to take.
