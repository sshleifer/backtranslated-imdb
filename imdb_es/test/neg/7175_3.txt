This is the bottom part of the B movie barrel of one of the studios of the poverty line, Monogram, in the mid-1940s, the type that filled a double ticket. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw was to see how JACKIE MORAN was in a lead role as a page boy on a radio station trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND just two years before, and this was one of his last roles in adolescence. He is not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as unfortunate as the production values ​​and is full of cliché-filled situations with a cast of people without talents uniformly. WANDA McKAY is the girl from the switchboard who was "discovered" by a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is the nerd friend of the hero who is afraid of her own shadow. It is resolved after a summary of all the suspects. Terribly exaggerated, the only quiet action of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after a too brief appearance. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but they are all Forgetful, as are the jokes and the lame dialogue.
