OK, we agreed with the stereotypical bad experience of the orphanage and we explained to our son, adopted from Russia, that it was an exaggerated performance and dramatization, in order to reach the dog playing football (since he plays football). But the last scene, in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son on the edge and cried for 15 to 20 minutes, "it has been replaced!" This of an elementary child. I DO NOT recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child; it shows adoption, orphanages and adults badly, and in the end, even though they win the game, the dog with which the child is linked has to leave, and this is too much. PLEASE be careful if you have adopted children and beware of families with biological children, because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and presents a stereotype that is unhealthy and unpleasant. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie ...)
