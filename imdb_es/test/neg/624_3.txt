I do not understand why many seem to hate this. <br /> <br /> This film unites many of the overlapping configurations of the historical and biblical epics of the 1950s, using parts, accessories and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, the story attempts to review all of human history, with a framework story about the human race that is being judged, with a guilty verdict that means that H-bombs will explode all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil, played with diabolical jubilation by Vincent Price. Well, it's a bit silly to call the defender "The spirit of all men", but I think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. The Spririt of Man is, by the way, played quite well by Ronald Coleman, in his latest film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played exclusively by country humor. Boy is not fun at all like a monk who thinks the world is flat, and we are told that Harpo is Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity. However, most of the other performances are well done. <br /> <br /> Other interesting things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space, which is described as a region of clouds and blue. There is something called "The great clock of outer space", which, when it reaches midnight, can indicate the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But deep down, the film addresses the problems of weapons of mass destruction and the eternal question of whether man is basically good, or basically bad; and he raises it in what I think is an interesting way. In addition, anyone who likes the appearance of the costume epics of the fifties will like the look of this movie.
