Um ... well, this is very poor if we compare it with the first film, Rosemary's Baby, very critically acclaimed. In fact, it's a pretty poor movie in general. Yes, there are some redeeming qualities, but I'll get to that later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a long time since the last movie was made ... in fact, it's been pretty I think eight years. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her son and influence him in a good way, instead of letting him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or "tribe", as it is called here) has introduced him. When she runs out with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up, leaving her son with a prostitute, the prostitute breeds him until he comes of age, where Satan tries to possess him as he seems to be rejecting his evil inheritance in all the places. by way of. <br /> <br /> Obviously, things do not go according to plan, and then there is the end of which I would have felt seriously embarrassed if I had not seen it coming since I heard there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby"! Granted, when I was about 11 years old, I witnessed the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and then read the sequel to the book. Thinking that this movie was an adaptation of that, I tracked this movie and got it ... was I right in doing it? Well, somehow, yes ... I'm a true fan of this "franchise" and I can say that I've seen the sequel, and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events in the first movie (talking about both this movie And "Son of Rosemary", the sequel to Ira Levin's own book, still not adapted to the film). <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first movie, is sometimes shown in this movie, but why-oh-why is the coven so different? The knife that Rosemary had dropped in the first movie is seen coming off the ground, but Minnie took it out! The coven is now called the tribe (as I said before). Now they go in hooded capes singing "God save you Satan ... God save you Adrian ... God save you Satan ... God save you Adrian ..." and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a nice little suburban house or something! And the child in himself looks quite normal, with his eyes only being "malicious" when he gets angry and kills someone or something in that vain. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's pretty poor everywhere, except Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrián. Pattie Duke Astin, who replaces Mia Farrow with Rosemary, has to have one of the WORST performances completely flat to be filmed! It's so bad that it's almost not funny ... when he shouts "OH MY GOD!" and she cries for the fifteenth time in the movie, you're like "Ok, it's not funny anymore", and when she's gone and the movie has been on for only twenty minutes, you're like THANK YOU. LORD, I DO NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU, SAY "OH MY GOD" ANYTHING ELSE! SHEESH! In the end, this film has very, very * few * redeeming qualities, enough to get at least four stars. But, if you see it as a serious continuation of the first film, it is practically nonexistent.
