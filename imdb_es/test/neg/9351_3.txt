A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sounds familiar), water has become the most valuable product (this has to sound familiar) and a small minority controls its distribution (what a surprise, it only has a heart attack and die of that surprise). A group of ice pirates (renegades of the water? Wet bandits? ... oh, wait, that last one has been used) tries to discover the route towards an unlimited supply of legendary water with a charming but spoiled princess (Druid ?) and a group of idiots and erected villains in pursuit. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential to be a great comic parody ("Star Wars", "Dune" by David Lynch), but it was simply not handled properly. It goes by, I think the term is "low eyebrow humor." He really does not succeed in being so funny, which is a shame, since he has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich, (hence the three stars) who are not exactly lazy in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely take a drink up.
