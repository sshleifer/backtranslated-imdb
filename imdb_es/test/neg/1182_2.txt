I stopped watching this movie halfway. It was just terrible! Boring subplots, devised. A complete lack of the pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill or the interpretation of Steve Railsback by Ed Gein. A film does not have to be historically accurate, but the actual story of Ed Gein is much more interesting than this third category melodrama that was created completely for no good reason. Ed Gein, played by Kane Hodder, is a cartoon sadist. Attempts to show the trauma inflicted by his mother are only weak exercises in a recycled style. And this movie wanted to be elegant, but it even ruined it. Fortunately, there is a better movie of this story. Ed Gein of 2001 told the story efficiently, and gave real chills as we watched a sick man who had no control over himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at the time, was already famous for memorably representing another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His ed had pathos. His movie is the one to watch. Avoid this mess.
