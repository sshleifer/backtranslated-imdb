Is not it depressing how Cartoon Network's most violent cartoons are aimed at girls? While I'm not watching the soldiers get shot or explode in Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a caricature or at least something on TV that I could watch to satisfy my violent impulses. And something that I would not scoff at for watching. I saw some episodes (I really should get shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do I find a gun?), And it's pretty clear that this lost its spark after the first episodes. If you like to see 500-foot monsters that can destroy large cities in seconds and be massacred by small children about a foot in height, this is a must. But it becomes very boring after a while, and with a program like this, even the original ideas become mainly boring. The film felt like an episode too long (I can not remember any of that), and the villain should have been much more intimidating than a green monkey. This show is a laughing action. The same basic premise occurs episode after episode after episode, and although you can try to have some mystery and intrigue from time to time, the ending will always be the same: "The Powerpuff Girls save the day!" Everything is good and beautiful, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 for being the only caricature hanging in the CN that revolves around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so it is not I will be vigilant forever I have established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I will not destroy that reputation ... 3/10
