In 1970, feminists invaded the beauty contest 'Miss World' in London and stopped the occasion by throwing flour and eggs onto the stage. Why? Because, rightly or wrongly, they felt that the event was degrading and degrading for women. I do not offer criticism of your actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why do not today's equivalents invade the studios where programs like this are done and do the same? <br /> <br /> 'Sex & The City' is about four self-absorbed New York women: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a kitten when a man looks at her with his claps, Charlotte longs to find the perfect man (they do not exist, love) so that she can use sex to catch the poor demon, the lawyer Miranda frightens men by means of nonsense like "out of touch with my emotions", and finally we have to Samantha, the living incarnation of Martini's old ad 'anytime, anywhere, anywhere'. Feminists hold these characters, especially Samantha, as a shining example of the status of a modern woman. Well, if shouting rude words in crowded restaurants is progress, I think feminists should take a long look and what they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> If 'Sex & The City' had been the creation of a man, it would have been taken out of the air because it was sexist. Instead, like 'Charlie's Angels' before, he has tricked supposedly intelligent women into thinking that he has acted as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold-blooded in the show. 'The Benny Hill Show' was also sexist, but at least it was fun.
