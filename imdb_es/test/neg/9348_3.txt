Wow. The plot of this was incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be a comic genre. But even so, even nonsense is supposed to have at least some vague sense. <br /> <br /> Has water become an incredibly rare substance? <br /> <br /> Well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances in the universe. And quite easy to do. Group the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voil√†, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something like that should have been used as a plot device as something pirates pursue. Water as a plot device was simply silly, stupid, silly. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" seemed laborious, artificial and forced. The comedy in the television series "Red Dwarf" was worked, contrived and forced, but it was actually fun. Here, however, I felt like saying: "Ha ha, that was very funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> I sigh ... all that money put in sets, costumes, actors. .. what a waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of just whining and whining and complaining about your lack of memory, my recommendations to improve it are: 1) Use a credible plot device. 2) Get rid of the "comedy". None of the actors was really good at that. The movie would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The obvious intention of the writers was to make a fake comedy, but they did not make it. It is not likely that you will ever see this again. It's too much of a total hack job.
