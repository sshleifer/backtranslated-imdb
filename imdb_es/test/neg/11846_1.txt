First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it almost 10 times just because I've wanted to spread the deliciously insipid entrails of this movie to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a handheld camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE game. And, above all, it has the consistency of a scraped face along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was in something big when I chose this movie from the DVD shelf (I was attracted to the box by the graphic of a velociraptor that shouts the word "RAPTOR" on the front). The scene contains treasures such as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts to make humor and rubber dinosaur puppets that are repeated throughout the film. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains erratic backdrops and use of props that make the mind melt at the thought that someone could be so shameless when it comes to creating a movie. An example is when a truck, in the middle of the night, is parked next to a cliff wall. The next day, they find him in an open area of ​​grass. The driver could not have driven him there since an anonymous bipedal carnivore bit him in the face (I'll explain why he is not mentioned in a second). Therefore, my only assumption is that either the velociraptor drove it, the cattle that the driver was transporting did it, or Jim Wynorski does not think very well of his viewers. Demons, in one part expect you to believe that they walk down a main street at night when the road has no gutters, the fire hydrant is placed precariously next to a telephone booth, and there is only a single street light. However, still, I feel compelled to see and see this movie again, only to be able to find more things that make me laugh the next time I see it. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The direction of this movie is horrible. Long extended pauses. Strange cuts to the characters that were not even close to the conversation. People discuss things informally while looking at the camera (and, in turn, make them look at the wall). They can not even give the dinosaur a coherent species, going from calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (which is distinguished by the disproportionate, extremely long and thick claw). This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The edition is prominent in this film. This is not good. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully produced in a single piece of garbage, but there must be a limit! The sub-plots end as abruptly as they began. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters that are not limited to, well, they are not explained at all! And an ending that felt like driving a muscle car on a brick wall without a seatbelt. You never know what will happen because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll just have to mention a single scene (the biggest one) that occurs near the end. This is a spoiler, but not really. The final scene contains a confrontation between the Tyrannosaurus Rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the confrontation between Sigourney Weaver and the alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic struggle. Quite a lot consists of Tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. A white lynx. In a space of several minutes, through a series of furtively slit cuts, the director manages to turn that white wildcat into a yellow forklift / crane that looks like a piece of machinery. Now, as I said, I know that this movie is made up of scenes from other movies, but what two films justify a confrontation with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1/10 for the quality of film making, but 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy.
