It's New Year's Eve, a police killer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) ends up in an enclosure that is closing up to the snow. When people are besieged, the police have to make a team with the cons to survive. This new version of John Carpenter's classic just had to add a few stupid twists, remove all the tension and add a horrible John Lequizamo to the cast, is not it? The first movie was exciting, rough and a joy to watch. This is more Hollywood, clich√© and painful to contemplate. The only thing I took from this movie was that OCD can be very annoying ... VERY. The final song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Comment by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comments; 5 minutes "Armed and Dangerous" featurette about the weapons expert; 7 minutes and a half "behind the Precinct Walls"; "Plan of attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 minutes and a half behind the scenes;, Trailers for "Unleashed", "White Noise",: Seed of Chucky "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I got it at Best Buy and it came with an extra disc including the first 2 minutes of "Cry Wolf", a first 10 minute look at "Unleashed", the trailer of that movie and a Fuzion interview with John Leguizamo
