As much as we can welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of ​​romance, I can not get rid of the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct porn movie to grade C video in which A ) the actors withdrew from making the scenes explicit or B) the producers were left without money to contract the insertions (something surprising if it were true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to figure out why the hell I had rented it, which was due to a credulity of the fans regarding the cover ads, which seemed to imply a feast of humor in the style of John Waters with a sexual theme. Okay, I laughed a couple of times and definitely has a sexual theme (although most can not be described as stimulating in any way). But, in some movies, you can go back to make sure you have listened to the dialogue correctly. In this case, advance quickly because you already know what you are about to say. But there's nothing to overtake, so you just have to overtake it on the shelf.
