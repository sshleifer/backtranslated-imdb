God! Where do I start? From beginning to end, I could not help but hate this movie. Vines? Vines that make cell phone noises? Oh, yes, I'm so scared, I'm going to get rid of the undergrowth of the earth! Come on people! The plot did not get anywhere. When the group discovered the ruin and the people of the village (no pun intended) came to warn them and armed weapons in front of their faces, do not worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! The whole scene really made me wonder why he did not take pictures of his boyfriend, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), cutting Mathias' legs (Joe Anderson). When the idiots threw the rope for the first time after Mathias, the way the rope was at least ten feet off the ground, but how he was finally able to stand only two or four feet off the ground. I can not begin to cover everything that was wrong with this movie, there is too much to cover. I will say that the graphics regarding the sangria were spectacular, but they were nothing since the performance and the script were terribly bad.
