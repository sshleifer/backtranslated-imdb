I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is low production, video of very poor quality and, especially, horrible audio. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to contemporary and later electronic music. The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad hoc, for the most part inarticulate mumbo jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a great personal interest in electronic music and have a capacity of attention above average, even for a slow and / or difficult subject, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and I had to review it to see the parts in which I slept . If you see this, make sure it is set, before viewing it, as Alex in The Mechanical Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame for the producer and director.
