... But it is not! I always wanted to know "what happened" later. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I'm a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more rejected by the movie. I compared "Scarlett" with the original GWTW because any film worth following GWTW had to be at the same level of quality as the first one. Rhett was marvelously launched, although NO ONE will be compared to Mr. Gable. I'm also a strict Vivien Leigh fan! She was Scarlett. She fits perfectly. No other actress in this life or another will adjust to the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" the work could have been done better. It was not enough to think about finding the right Scarlett, that was evident. <br /> <br /> In general, something to turn to, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write it or find a fan fiction. This movie is not worth the time.
