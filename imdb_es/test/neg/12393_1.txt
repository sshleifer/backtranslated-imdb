I was surprised that there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies, especially if it is recommended. I must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worse, since he tried to be so smart that he made me squirm when he saw it. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is comparable to Audition Week on American Idol. You look because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie did not have bad actors. So, how fun would it be to have good singers who try to convince them that they should not get close to an American Idol test? It would be useless like this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overrated. We have all been in that environment in which a group of friends gets into a roll and all break up with tears in their eyes. I feel it is improvisation. The improvement can not be activated just because the camera is rolling as this movie demonstrates. If you like Drew Carey to present an improvisation program, you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the jokes were bad, the improvisation was sophisticated and the exaggerated action on the part of Guest and the company was corny. ..and those are my congratulations of this nonsense. If a guy who plays a trumpet And the drum of the kettle at the same time makes you funny, that's fine. For me, I prefer more exciting things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost his mood in the 1980s, so maybe you like this. classified humor I kept waiting for a person to identify as the zookeeper and then tell us that there was no zoo in the city. That is the humor that can wait. <br /> <br /> My only wish was that I give it a negative rating.
