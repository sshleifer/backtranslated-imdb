This was bad enough. Pedestrian work or worse. I do not think it was homophobic, really bad. In any case, he was really amateur, like when you are 14 years old and you discover for the first time the words of the curse and the leather magazines. <br /> <br /> The main point of this movie, the romance, becomes really flat. I can not help wondering if the writers ever had a serious relationship before this movie. <br /> <br /> the tracings and the rhythm are horrible, and they do not go anywhere. In a minute we're watching these guys catch cheaters, then we're in a gay club and then we're on a date. Out of nowhere, the girl apparently likes comics, and then they sleep together. none of this feels real, like a Shakespeare production in an elementary school if Hamlet was written by a frat boy. <br /> <br /> The ending was a kind of chilling revenge fantasy on the part of a loser who was abandoned by a girl. Unnecessary and really a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> Still, you have to see it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others noted, the director's comment is actually funny: what kind of professional talks about "hitting" or "relating" with actresses? The dialogue stank, relationships lacked chemistry. You'll be on the floor laughing at this pretentious donkey.
