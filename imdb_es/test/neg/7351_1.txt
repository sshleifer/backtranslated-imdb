I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is horribly the worst of the whole program. Now I'm not interested in many episodes of the later series, but this one takes the cookie! It was not funny or offensive. As for the end, I'm sorry, but it upset me more than any other combined episode. <br /> <br /> I mean, the guys think they have good intentions, but the ending was so annoying, they think the whale belongs. On the moon and on the credits, we see that he has died. What could have saved the episode was if the pranksters could confess what they did. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no outgoing message. Okay, South Park may be guilty of preaching too much and it's always good to see one that is not approved (like Make Love Not Warcraft), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid it at all costs!
