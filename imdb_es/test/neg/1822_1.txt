This brief review does not contain spoilers since the movie breaks down. It is wooden and pedantic. It has no saving grace at all. If someone invites you to their house to see "Mr. Imperium", do not go. Even the title of the film is appalling and presages the garbage. The whole plot is so bad that it could lead Mother Teresa to despair! It was not a stroke that led to the early disappearance of poor Ezio, it was having to act in this pot that stopped him. He must have pursued him for the rest of his days. Maybe he was a foreign enemy and wanted to take revenge on the Americans for their confinement. He found a perfect vehicle for his anger in this farce.
