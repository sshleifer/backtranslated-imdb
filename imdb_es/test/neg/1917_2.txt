****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie stunk. Let me say now that I totally agree with what Carissaphillips said about this. What was Sam thinking? She was with a guy who told her that he loved her (3 times in all), that he was EXTREMELY HOT, and stayed with her despite her difficult times (Josh Hartnett). But, she decided to break up with him, no, cheat on him with a bad-tempered, ugly, spoiled, evil loser who never said he loved her in the whole movie (oh wait, he wrote it on the wall, did not it?), and left her in her time of need because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I sat for the whole movie was because I had Josh Hartnett in it and hoping that maybe she would die in the end. He wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who really was worthy of him. The whole "your mom" thing was funny. I loved it. I hate when the people here say it, but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have told Sam too, she needed a good slap. How the romance began is a mystery to me. Anyway, they never said anything, so I do not understand how they came together. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... I had mustard or mayonnaise or ..." Oh, come on. The supposedly romantic lines were so stupid. In addition he is sososoosoososo ugly! I must admit that I cried in this movie. For a long time, very hard. Not because she died, but because it broke Jasper's heart. He cried so many times in this movie ... tried to smile but could not contain the tears. Cried when 1) He said he loved her 2) He got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and saw how happy he was with him 4) She died. I cried when he cried because he loved her all his life and told her, and yet she was foolish enough not to worry and love a boy who left her in her time of need and who did NOT call at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars only because I LOVE JOSH HARTNETT! Oh, by the way, Chris Klein, YOUR MOM! -Sily's sister
