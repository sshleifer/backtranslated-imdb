Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror movie" I've seen in my life. Why? 1) The premise is GOOD beyond ridicule 2) The damn thing does not even have legs to move on! 3) Escape AFTER being completely immersed in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this ... Travel across an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff who did it in the first movie. 5) "Killer snowballs". I still have to be drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man", so at the time of writing, Jack Frost 2 has the distinction of being the most stupid "horror" movie of all time. Even overcoming the iniquity of his predecessor (if you can believe it!).
