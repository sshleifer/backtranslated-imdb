This movie was, out of 67 of the 71 best photos I've seen, by far the worst. First, I found the plot somewhat absurd: the husband absent for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the boy who was absent for so long working on an oil rig next to the congress party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotypes of African-Americans I've ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive! I've hardly seen a movie that disgusted me so much. UGH!
