¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡PEQUEÑOS SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors get involved in such an unreflective recount? <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro plays a Hollywood Dumb version of the standard <br /> <br /> aggressive police prone to Violence (ie, hit the bad guys and put your eyes in the hands of the cops who prefer to stay with them.), and Eddie Murphy plays a cop <br /> <br /> Not so hard that I would rather be an actor (ie, scream, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, police!" and have His "hard look" down. <br /> Naturally, <br /> <br / > are associated when the tactics of Bobby's loose cannons put him in the hot water <br /> <br /> with the media and is essentially blackmailed to star in a <br /> <br /> "Cops", like a reality show, breathe, because that's the funniest thing that you have <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy was put into the script, it feels like a pale retread of <br /> > <br /> All the pe Buddy's lyrics released in a blender with "15 Minutes" starring, <br /> <br /> yes, DeNiro as, practically the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The jokes are discouraged, the action feels apathetic, and nobody seems to be having a good time. He is dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time. Even if you have an excessive affinity <br /> <br /> for one of the actors, avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze if this <br /> <br /> makes money, these types of scripts will be considered perfectly acceptable <br /> <br /> for the actors of their quality. <br /> <br /> And for Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You were nominated to receive awards for them, remember how much fun it was <br /> <br />? Now after "Analyze This" (which was good), "Meet the <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good), and "The Adventures of Rocky and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" (which was NOT good), I think we need to see you parody <br /> <br /> yourself less, and BE yourself more. "Casino" feels like a long time ago <br /> <br /> ago. And no, I do not count "15 minutes" as Bobby serious. Anyone who <br /> <br /> has taken media satire seriously should receive their weekly news from the world
