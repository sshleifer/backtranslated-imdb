This movie has to be the worst movie of 2007, it was really bad and I do not think I've seen a movie that is so bad, I mean they do not make really bad Hollywood movies, right? Hamish should really dedicate himself to singing instead of acting because he just can not act, God was so bad, I mean he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than him, in terms of his acting, she plays the same role in all the movies, God is so boring to look at it, I mean, what do men see in this woman? Yes, she has a body of God, but where is that talent? I have not seen it yet and, at this rate, I do not think I ever will. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hamish falls in love with Ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my God, she was the best actor in the movie and she does not seem to be 15 years old at all, to me It seems that he is 21 years old, but his performance was brilliant in the film. God bless you, it was very good, I hope to see you more in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry another person, a typical Bollywood movie anyway there is a hiccup (it can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and they both get married in the end. <br /> <Well, I would give the music 10/10, it was excellent, which made the movie a success, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. Anyway, all I can say is go buy music and not watch the movie.
