He stumbled upon this movie on Amazon.com. I had never heard of its release, but the three reviews gave it five stars and very favorable reviews, so, as a lover of German films, I bought a copy ... I have to say that it did not impress me. The production values ​​are cheap, the story is derivative, the characters are less attractive and for a comedy it is surprisingly short in laughter. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this, but it seemed mediocre and boring. Or maybe I expected more from independent German cinema than a gay twist in The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Are there fragments in the film that do not make any sense, like one of the Leather Bear's trying to put Ecki in a sling, as if he looked at it twice? Or the vengeful ex-wife appearing in the party but ending up cheering on her gay estranged husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well, at least that explains the title of films from the United Kingdom, I suppose ...
