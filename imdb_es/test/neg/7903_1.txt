Well, to begin with, I'm so high up that black goes black, and I can tell you it's very sad when blacks think a "black movie" sucks. I can not say that I have ever seen a movie with such a poorly directed story line or worse. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my friend and everything, but he did not feel this movie at all, I do not. They know how much they paid for being in this garbage can called a movie, but I hope it's enough to eliminate the smell. <br /> <br /> It's all about supporting a film of discomfort, but this was wrong, really very bad We made explosions in all aspects, there was no real plot, the story was useless, the cast could not act and The best was the white man! Theater, half the crowd up and left before it was over, I still wish that I did too. Save yourself a little pain and go see something else, anything else ...
