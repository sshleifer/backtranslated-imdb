In this desperate and utterly foolish attempt to keep the Hammer's Dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power for a long time, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in 1972 London. Exactly one hundred years after that was destroyed by his archenemy Van Helsing, a hidden disciple named Johnny Alucard (understood? Understood?) He reunites his extravagant friends in an abandoned church, including the great-granddaughter Jessica de Van Helsing, and performs a satanic ritual that resuscitates Dracula in a haze of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc on Van Helsing's entire lineage and the fragile Jessica is the ideal victim to achieve it. This is probably the only movie of the 70s that is greatly exceeded in trying to look like a movie from the 70s! Considering that Dracula's six previous films were developed in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson really wants to underline the fact that we are now in the 20th century and, therefore, he fills his film with unbearable hippie characters, horrible tendencies of 70's fashion and horrible 70's music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem irretrievably lost in this environment and their performances show it with regret. The opening sequence (a flashback) and the climax of the showdown are quite pleasant, but everything between them is painfully boring and the opposite of what is scary. The most important elements of this series of films have always been the dark castles of Dracula and the exciting coaching races and, obviously, this installment lacks all that. Luckily for fans, contemporary Hammer studios launched other vampire movies that are much better ("The Vampire Lovers," "Twins of Evil," "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"). Not recommended.
