I was not sure where this was going until the end. when it turned out that all this was a liberal conspiracy to deliver the world to the weak Europeans and the United Nations. What a burden of rights! By the way, the part that Canada joined the United States really did not have much to do with the plot and the idea never developed. The only point of this seems to be that he made the main character eligible to run for president (but they could have made him American and dispense with that). In any case, this was a load of bulls and not worth your time. If you do not want to see this kind of thing, look at the brilliant political thriller of the BBC "State of Play".
