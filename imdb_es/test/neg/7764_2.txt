I know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a buzz and an excessive analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can not STOP that Carrie is analyzing every little thing in this program and that's what really killed him for me. In addition, Charlotte's complaints about her nonexistent problems made my ears ache and Miranda's cynicism was a complete slaughter. I mean, can not she be happy? Samantha was the only genius on the show and the only one worth seeing. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth seeing, the rest of them were pretty much the same. The humor was drier than a bucket of sand, and a plot not very interesting. In general, it's not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
