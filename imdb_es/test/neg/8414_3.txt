This movie is a bad movie, but to get some nutritional value from it, I recommend watching it on your back with Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> There is much to learn from seeing how different directors can draw different interpretations of it. Actors playing the same characters. Watch Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the excellent work she did in the first movie against the horrible interpretation of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved in the sequel was aware of the first movie and did any of them see Rosemary's Baby before doing this? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial, then it is better to avoid this one. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really do not want to go there.
