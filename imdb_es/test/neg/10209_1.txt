No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. Stinks hardcore like a serious movie. Look more at the way you should plan 9 from outer space. They are the same in that they are so bad that they are fun. The fun moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that are not supposed to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan, since only he can do it) takes the driver of the limousine off the front after his first encounter with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity occurs and is a part of the movie that everyone should see . It could be the funniest scene in history, I swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, someone thought that this movie would make money that I will never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission. I hope that at least they have been fired. This movie wins 1 out of 5 on my scale and that's just for the involuntarily funny parts.
