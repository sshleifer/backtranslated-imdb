I'm a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of it, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the puppets and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk who is doing this project to animate inanimate objects can not act. It sucks His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be great, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I would see it for 2 hours. But, on the other hand, the role of the puppets is down, and the whole movie suffered for it. The mystical type of Skull that created the totem is cheesy at best, and the appearance of Decapitrons is highly anticipated, short and really quite disappointing. You'd be better off seeing the first one again.
