This film was shameful in its clich√©s, bad performance and generally low production values. It starts off badly with the long-haired 3-star general who calls the hero, Masters, "older" when he obviously wears the silver oak leaves of the lieutenant colonel. But the most distressing was the crew of soldiers in the atoll of Neptune. How outside of contact with any kind of reality can you get? All were experts in flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were incredible. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! Look at your own risk!
