Glenn Ford, a boy from New York who has been saving his money, his thumbs and his hobos to go to the Arizona ranch he has bought, where he hopes to find HEAVEN WITH A BARBED WIRE FENCE. <br /> <br /> A film with a script and a story by Dalton Trumbo, directed by the extraordinary villain Ricardo Cortez, and starring the often nervous Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte, should not be so incredibly friendly. Although the system, seen mostly as police and railroad bulls and real estate scammers, is as horrible as one might expect from Mr. Trumbo leftist, every proletarian is so sweet and nice and the salt of the earth that one feels nauseated. help that the heroine, a sweet blonde thing that is an illegal alien refugee fleeing Franco's Spain, is annoying for both script and acting reasons. <br /> <br /> So, why watch? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his personality and a good part. And there are some moments of the leftist camp of the 30s that are quite amazing. (Did Dalton absolutely have to establish a large part of the film in the Russian Worker's mission? All that was missing was the portrait of a radiant Joe Stalin!) Also, this is Glenn Ford's first substantive role (although his performance It is not good ). <br /> <br /> Why not watch? Essentially, the film offers an unconvincing vision, is linked to a political point of view that is laughable, and the two protagonists have made much better films. In addition, Dalton Trumbo's strengths as a screenwriter are nowhere to be seen. Instead, we get a movie that the Coen brothers, Barton Fink, could have written in an instant (and avoid that hellish fight with the writer's block).
