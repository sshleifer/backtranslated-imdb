A group of people goes into the jungle for several reasons, and finally finds a lost city (where apparently they are King Solomon's Diamonds) and a race of super-gorillas ... Now, you know you're in trouble when you're fine. actors like Linney and Curry in a movie that stars ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... well, it lacks that. The first hour (!) Of the movie are not even in the jungle, they're just trying to get there, with a secondary argument after a subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do They do ... it just is not fun anymore. <br /> <br /> The effects of the movie are pretty much (and really bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now, the end ... The father does not care about the death of his son, but he is only interested in diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in the movies, only in the movies. <br /> <br /> A complete loss of talent, this adaptation of Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
