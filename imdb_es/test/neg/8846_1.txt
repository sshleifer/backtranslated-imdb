Forget the bad performance, which can be forgiven in this type of movie. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Much worse is the flagrant absence of a skilled or experienced director who perhaps took a vacation with the editor while the film was being made. When watching the movie, it feels completely out of date although it was 'only' done 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the next life? hahaha A telephone connection to the Internet? Images of Clucky's ghosts photographed in the photos ("Hey! Look there ... is that ... is that a face?" -Elbow in the face- -Oops, the sound is interrupted- "cut" -next scene-), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and, as a result, do not flow at all. You will be seeing a girl find a corpse that still hangs from the knot in a scene and then, literally, 10 seconds later, she will see her again in a seemingly unaffected place, smiling and moving. <br /> <br /> Apart from the many The problems I have with the film in terms of production value, are also painfully long and repetitive and, therefore, absolutely boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Shutter' instead, a well-made Oriental (Thai) horror movie.
