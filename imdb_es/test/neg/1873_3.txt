This is not a good movie for a standard. It is very poorly written and the performance is a bit above the average (some performances are well below average, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job with little to work). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as indicated above, Swayze and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> The script. The "bad guys" were simply too bad to be credible. The best villains are the ones who are not so obviously bad. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOTHING that would let me believe that they could be real people (maybe there are people like them, but I do not want to see a movie about it). ). <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first where Gray and Swayze meet when resort employees are "dancing". Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to have fun. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile towards her. Why? What happened in the middle to make him not like it so when they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I shuddered at the end when Swayze muttered the line "Nobody puts the baby in the corner." How did he NEVER do it with a serious face?) < <br /> <br /> Another bad thing, the scenario of the 1960s. Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980s! Who was in charge of the suits and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (original music for the movie) was ridiculous (with the exception of "I Had the Time of My Life", which was a good song). <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the most overrated one
