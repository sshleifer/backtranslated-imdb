I mistakenly thought that this was the 70s movie about the bed that people eat, which sounded interesting. It's not interesting, I mean, much less about a bed to eat men. <br /> <br /> I guess Stuart Gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" on almost anything that a video camera has been shot at, in order to build a library of franchise. Little more can be said about this work apart from the execution time is less than 90 minutes. Of course, it is a bed that is obsessed with the spirit of a man, or something like that, that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way, we get ** an initial five-minute credit sequence (is that "Lawrence Of Arabia" even time?) ** a murderer with Marylin Manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye" ** demonstrations of a sexual practice that Michael Hutchence may have used ** a preview of what Emilio Est√©vez will soon look like and act as ** a soft core that even Cinemax would broadcast ** manbutt and a topless scene ** crazy (or is it "whack" -ee?) ending with hammer blows without wanting hilarious and strawberry cake left over (well, it seemed to me that way) ** and a rudimentary surprise that ends up for nothing. It's as if the screenwriter even fell asleep on the "Deathbed" before finishing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's recorded in high-definition video and it does not look bad, but it does not. You also look good, the acting is good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, and so is everything else. Probably nobody would have seen or heard it unless it was on a disc with another movie, the modern "double function". I was not paying attention to parts of that, so I've missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Score: PASS
