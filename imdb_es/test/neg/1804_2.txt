If you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected, and the movie disappointed me even more. The list of actors was unfortunate, and the plot was pathetic and it was not like the book, except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when they read Heart of Darkness, and they create their own movie in their head, but the director cuts important scenes and adds useless scenes. If there was someone in the movie who was supposed to belong to a certain culture, I should have used an actor who was from that culture. There are actors from everywhere, and I'm sure they could have found better to fit into the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and he created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for, but the movie was cheap and useless, and someone who could make the film as respectable as the book should have done it. If you want a movie that drags you into the dark, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
