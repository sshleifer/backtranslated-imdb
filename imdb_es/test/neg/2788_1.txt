Let's start by recognizing that there are three types of horror movies: the good, the bad and the shameful films that make the whole genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises big time with its Artisan DVD cover, but you can be sure that's where the show stops. After an exhausting opening montage, we soon discovered that the film consists of a very poorly written script, very poorly qualified (even for a beginner movie), disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, could anyone afford anything more than a mask for the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so it's good enough for us? Well, it did not work at all to create a terrifying villain. In any case, this is one of the movies that make you check your watch, sigh and curse your own gullibility. The time in each scene is painful, and all the production has a feeling of secondary (on second thought, I have seen better productions of the secondary stage, even special effects). I am trying to think of some way to finish this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train crash be donated as coasters, frisbees, wind chimes ... I would say "Go see yourself "but that would be cruel. <br /> <br /> See the rest of the reviews of this production company and you will find the same for each of their films. They claim that they respect the contract between the film and the audience (that is, they please the fans), but all they have done is laugh and drop a load on our heads for the money (which I'm sure they saw very little for this). <br /> <br /> Sorry, high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously published by those who are directly or indirectly connected to this spoof. <br /> <br /> 1 star of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. Giving it even to one makes me angry.
