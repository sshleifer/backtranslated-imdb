I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle; Actually, the acting is not so bad and the story is not as terrible as some movies made for Disney have been. The story itself is superficial and underdeveloped, but that's not surprising in a movie like this. The acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but I give credit to the actors for doing anything with the material they had to work with. <br /> <br /> However, in my book, it is inexcusable to base a complete story on the theory that they have created a "perfect" pop star and then they have chosen an actress who can not sing to save her life . If the girl can not sing, have someone who can record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a TERRIBLE singer. It was so flat that I usually sang with a totally different key!
