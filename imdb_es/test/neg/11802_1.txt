Agree they tell you it's real. They do not list any scriptwriter or director, but a vision of this movie will work for anyone, it's not real the way you expected. Talking rarely sounds like a real natural conversation ... but it also does not seem to be written. (possibly without a script). It sounded to me a lot more like they were always trying to do ad-lib. (who almost always did badly). Therefore, they knew that they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural images. So I'm sure these people knew what was happening, they knew they had certain places to look for things that had been created ... and they were simply told to get ready with everyone. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Senior Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ******************* <br /> <br /> Well, it's very scarce. Every item, place or thing that could be strange or that is used as a scare, is magically stumbled by these people. Let me make a list of the ridiculously false and obvious things that happened that I remember: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes of entering the house, turn on a light switch: light sparks and a lamp Spider almost fall a boy. <br /> <br /> 2) It turns out they find an old medical bag with a butcher knife with blood * on it, while they explore the basement. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a noise in a closet, so they open the door slowly - BAM - a cat is in there and jumps straight into the camera while screaming. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they realize that there is a hole in the wall, so we put the hand ... wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh, it feels "heavy" Here ... BOOM - a chair flies through the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl who was afraid of insects had a ROACH in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's take out the Ouija board ... Oops, one of the legs of the planchette fell off the side of the board. That could not be because people pushed him, right? (They discover that a ghost there is called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the fireplace? CLINK - oh, my ties fell off "I think she * kept the people up here." <br /> <br /> 9) Now, the thin girl is going to be brave looking up the chimney ... oh, what is this? She sees something ... and is asking people who are not looking through the fireplace what it is. SWISH - It falls directly towards her. (perfect camera) She moves just in time. It was more a chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and 'clean' each of our designated rooms. Would not it be something if things started to happen one by one to these people now ...? : <br /> <br /> CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly your room is shaking ... but nobody else does. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: Actually he says to himself "Charles, it's that Charles, you can not be you because you're just a figment of my imagination, do not you, Charles? Well, guess what, it's knocked down and dragged along the ground Another lucky camera shot. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hear things ... try to communicate ... and he's standing there with abrasions or something like that. <br /> < TYPE # 2: He was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the ground and got a splinter ... I do not remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) The guy # 2 he runs, he gets to Chick # 2 ... They listen to the girl and the guy # 1 screaming ... they find them chained to a wall and tied to a table. (*) They leave. He says they escaped safely, were treated by minor courts, and since then they have had nightmares and insomnia, we also discovered that the next day a 911 call was made by naming someone named "Charles". <br /> <br /> * ********* ** * 'Main spoilers' **************** ****************** about ******** ** ********** <br /> <br /> Well, when I first heard that this movie was being made, I could not wait. I thought it was going to be real. Real real. - And more professionals, with people of a more professional type. I love the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I would love to see really disturbing images. Before this movie was released, I saw several reviews of people online. Both affirmed how false it was and how stupid people were. Time passed. I forgot the movie ... then I realized that it was never released in theaters. So I discovered that it was straight to the video, I rented it ... I discovered that every brutal critique was completely true. It's a shame, I really wanted this to be good. <br /> <br /> Random thinking: the house did not seem to have televisions, radios ... kitchen appliances that I remember ... what would make me think that No One has lived there for a long time. Especially the house is truly known to be obsessed ... I'm pretty sure no one lives there. But he looks so clean and tidy ... and what was a cat doing there? The property has no close neighbors ... <br /> <br /> In general, you will only want to rent this if you and your friends want to sit there and make fun of it ... or if you knew it a long time ago and you were intrigued. (You will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random thinking: I think the producer says "the material you see is real". Well, technically it's real material, right? Real images of false appearances? Maybe that was his loop hole. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a star, strictly for the fact that they told the story of Madame LaLaurie. A true history of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The best performance was that of the boy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting team at the beginning. Obviously it was really real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
