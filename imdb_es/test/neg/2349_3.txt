Regardless of what they say, it's a serial movie, and the effects are wrong ... if you're a vampire fan, I guess it would be fine, not 10 out of 10, can not others here honestly say that? We should see this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and the characters are important, as well as the story. The story is good, but it does not carry the film, it is not surprising that it has a low overall rating. I write this because I chose to watch this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but I was very disappointed. Do not get me wrong, I thought that the Blade films were incredible, and I loved the films of the underworld, but these characters are not close. the makeup of the vampires is badly done, and the effects are worse. This sucks. It's possible that I was not so disappointed if I had not read the reviews that told me how wonderful it was. The reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is amazing, you do not mind acting or makeup. This is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for a correct story ...
