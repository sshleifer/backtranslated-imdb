'Til There Was You is one of the worst movies we've seen. It fails in all aspects. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) in Waterworld. In comparison, this movie is Dungworld. When a character stumbles one, or even twice, in the course of a movie, one can understand it. But Jeanne's character falls, stumbles, stumbles so often that she might have a little Jerry Lewis in her. In his defense, each fall (Prat?) Was probably blocked, choreographed and rehearsed. And rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for a movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot "smoking" or trying to find a place to smoke. If the movie was a diatribe to not have a place to smoke, Ok, BUT, it is not. <br /> <br /> As much as this movie runs, it is too long for 10 minutes after the execution time. <Br /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, CASI acts in a public forum meeting. ALMOST you almost see her break her life in the character. Oh, it's ALMOST as compelling as his scene screaming at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, on second thought, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are stuck in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch the shots of HOOPER (Burt Reynolds). And even then, toss a coin or go to sleep.
