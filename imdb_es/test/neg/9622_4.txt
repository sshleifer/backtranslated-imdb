I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid moviegoer and amateur filmmaker. As I was telling my friends during my lunch break, MirrorMask may be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Like the short film Moongirl, the film lost its marks. Several times during the film he made humorous attempts. It prepares you for laughter. Instead of making you laugh, it makes you feel empty. The jokes were reminiscent of one of the recent Star Wars movies. They were not funny unless you had five. And the performance felt equally terrible. I have seen actors acting in front of a blue screen. And I have believed it. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This film takes a formula and tries to apply it with beautiful illustrations. And although the script is fully functional and the special effects are quite beautiful, it has nothing to do with that and fails miserably. I left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater. I felt sanctified and miserable and I still have not taken the bitter taste out of my mouth. I love independent cinema. I encourage people to watch independent films to support them. But not this movie. This movie should not have been made. At least, not like that. Why did the director miss the marks so clearly? They were clearly configured? Not only humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were badly synchronized and delivered. It was as if the film walked on three legs instead of four. His steps are clumsy and missing timed. And could it fall with the slightest push? I do not see this movie. I do not care who you are. It's not worth your time.
