"Tragic hero" is a film that tries to emulate the classic Godfather movies, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. In addition, this is part of a two-part series, as was The Godfather (at that time). However, this film is not close to the level of those classic films and, in fact, fairs worse than other Triad thrillers that premiered in Hong Kong at that time. <br /> <br /> One reason is the performance. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally exaggerated and incredible. The audience tends to find humorous procedures simply because the inability of the actors to maintain any degree of seriousness. As a result, we find that the film is not truly emotional or intense, since we do not care especially what happens with these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is their lack of focus. The narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film, but this makes parts of the film underdeveloped and lacking a real sense of coherence. The audience is sometimes lost in the procedures we are seeing, without knowing what the character's motivations are. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film contains a decent gun fight, but again, since we do not care about the characters, we do not care who lives or who dies; The scene loses its intensity and suspense because of this. The other pieces of action are rather of a mundane nature, with the feeling that they are too controlled instead of flowing freely. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a strictly average movie and is not recommended for the film in general. viewer ... Only hard-core enthusiasts and Chow Yun Fat fans should consider this movie to watch it.
