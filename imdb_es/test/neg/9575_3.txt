Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenating formula, Marnie sees it as her chance to become beautiful. When you are denied the drug due to possible side effects, kill your colleague to get what you want. The drug works and she gets beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst of it and it does not take long before it has left a chain of bodies behind it. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression "as exciting as seeing the paint dry"? That pretty much sums up Satanik. During the film, one of the characters pronounces the line: "Something so horrible, it is inconceivable". I was not sure if he was talking about something in the movie or in the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had high hopes for this. Satanik had possibilities, but they never realized. At every opportunity, the plot has Marnie doing the most boring things she can imagine. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so attractive and can not take the movie alone. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and the editing. It's a disaster. We see things and places that have nothing to do with anything in the movie. The camera remains in shots too long after the scene ends. I can not think of a single shot that would call anything less original. This group of filmmakers exhibits little imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposedly based, but I'm sure he has to be better than this. .
