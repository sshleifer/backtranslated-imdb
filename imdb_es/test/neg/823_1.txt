Bean, Kevin & Perry, TV creations from the UK that have made successful transitions to the BIG screen. Now it's Ali G's turn and I'm afraid this is not one of them! <br /> <br /> Ali has always been obscene but fun. This movie was extremely sick and not funny at all. Scenes that include bestiality, gay sex and pedophilia should not be represented as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Ali G In Da House is a garbage and deserves to make very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
