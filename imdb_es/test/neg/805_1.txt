Monotonous, sad and a total loss of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so do not think too much). The performance is strange and wooden: I could have sworn they were all professional bodybuilders trying to try their luck, but that could be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but many fires, explosions, a free sex scene, etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that it occurs after a war between EE. UU And Iraq that somehow becomes nuclear. ..hmmm Is Roger Corman psychic? Let's hope that "Iraq" is just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario does not come true. <br /> <br />
