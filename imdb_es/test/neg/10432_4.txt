I saw it on a screening DVD a couple of months before its release. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the story in general, but some scenes are rather sloppy and confusing. The sets fit together, but a few seemed to be remnants of Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial picture in a middle-class house. Definitely not what the cover of the DVD says, "Destined to be the next stoner classic", barely. <br /> <br /> The costumes and hairstyles are well made and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, it is always good to see them a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost all the scenes contained guitars that were still playing. The sound design was a bit poor. I think that less would have been better.
