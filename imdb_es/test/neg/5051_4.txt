The only reason I saw this movie for the second time, was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl who played with Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. I've never heard of it before. She is lovely. Captivating. With an animated face and a cute body, it is very observable ... It has a real "Poisenality" ... More than a fleeting vibe of Grace Kelly ... with youthful exuberance. I think it's Irish in the genetic background, (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense to look like the most beautiful Irish American. The movie does not have anything special, Katie Holms is the classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, I was around 25 years old, at its best. This reminds me of another silly and worthless movie with the only redemption that is Pretty Girl in it. It was the "Career Opportunities" the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Grease II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
