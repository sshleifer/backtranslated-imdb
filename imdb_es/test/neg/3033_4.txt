The film progresses quite well, but the acting, direction and editing leave much to be desired. Most of the characters are raised from other movies and the lookalike of Vinnie Jones is taken out of Gone in 50 seconds. The gangster comedy movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, the stupid Lock Stock dealers and the shooting that leaves everyone dead. You should never really know if you laugh or just sit there in shock. This movie had the right elements, but it's too easy to sit there as a person knitting and pulling on the little details that should have been arranged somewhere along the line and once you've stopped believing, you turn each more critical time. Pity because it was a brave attempt and, although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying he will be fine for a scene, he puts the work before shooting and it is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more training and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference.
