As Paul Kersey was running out of real relatives to get revenge, the third installment of the "Death Wish" saga revolves around his return to New York to visit an old warmate. He arrives only to discover that Brooklyn completely transformed into an impoverished mafia zone and that young thugs killed his friend and continually terrorize all the other tenants of a dilapidated apartment building. Kersey reaches an agreement with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond lawyer, destroys numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum pistol, and gradually trains and inspires petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, it does not make more sense to defend the "Death Wish" series after watching the third part. The original of 1974 was a masterpiece that turned on the social drama as much as it did in punishment and, although it was pure exploitation, the second part still had a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were logically linked to the what happened. in the first. Number three often feels like a completely separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more sociable and communicative than he used to be and, suddenly, nobody, not even the police, is against the actions of the vigilantes. All these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their success of "Desire of Death" to a series of purely intelligent and exploitative action, with a number of deaths that increases enormously with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosives and criminals that become more unpleasant, of bad quality, more evil and much harder to kill. However, the knights did not seem to realize that the continuous fire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, that is, it is extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of film masturbation. This description could not be more accurate, since the script moves wearily from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. Particularly the last twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of shots, explosions and executions made through homemade improvised measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has a quite interesting supporting cast, which includes Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the neighbor of fatigue who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot" , "The Longest Yard") as unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) In his debut role as one of the thugs.
