While I write this, there are still no user reviews, but there are 17 votes with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought that this movie had its moments. I did not notice any, and even if I had, I think I could not have stopped rolling my eyes long enough to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> A common debate among film fans is whether the main mistakes are made. Science, police tactics and other things so common in movies B should downplay the enjoyment of one. I tend to fall in the field "Yes, that's a reasonable reaction", especially when mistakes are fundamental to the plot. With this movie, I hope to read how someone can defend this mess. They completely destroy almost all aspects of military tactics and strategies, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense and human behavior (that is, outside B movies). In short, I can not think of anything trivial in which they guessed right. <br /> <br /> Any film would have its work ahead when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, capable of disappearing into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to just one more explosion big. (They do not do ghosts like they used to). Combine this premise with every detail that is wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.
