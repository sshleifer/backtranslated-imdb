Occasionally, I accidentally left television after "South Park" and ended up catching part of the high school humor train crash that is "Mind of Mencia". It's the only time I wish my room was cleaner because I could find the remote much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a replacement "Chappelle Show", and what they got was a show that attracts idiots who miss Dave and cling to any minority variety show, or are satisfied with the plain. Mexicans love the "taco" jokes that Carlos Mencia puts in every week, however, I must understand that there are some people who really find Mencia * shudder * funny, I strongly support my words when I say that I think these people exist only in However, if you are really out there, I only ask you never to enter my housing district, and read these big differences between Carlos and the "Chappelle Show": <br /> <br /> 1) Dave You might want to highlight this one. <br /> <br /> 2) "The Chappelle Show" was FIVE TIMES as bold as Mencia could never be, however, whenever a promotion appears for your little show It's about him, playing his own horn about how he is nothing he has seen before. You have that right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle did not need to tell people he was nervous and funny. We all stayed to see the program and discover it for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had racial jokes that delved into different cultures, things that some people did not know. about. As his game segment "I know blacks." The big prize was some hair cream used by blacks. That is deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive. So, how dare he call himself nervous? If Mencia were writing that sketch, the big prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. And my accusations have some merit. A few days ago I saw a promotion of his program (which affectionately I called 'My TV monitor Taking A - t for thirty minutes') and it was a stereotyped outline of the Olympic Games, which I admitted to me was quite beautiful. funny concept Then I saw that the Mexican who won received a green card as a great prize. That's?! Is that the closest thing to the fire you want to get? Who COULD NOT think of that, again in the seventh grade? For you, fans of the program, if you ever see it and miss one of your strikeouts, maybe because you and your friends were discussing how "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and in no way is part of the joke. where someone funny would have something intelligent to say, just remember that, anyway, there are only five possible options for punchlines: green cards, studs, jumpers, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-de-dur. Just remember, whatever it was, it was shouted. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Type of relationship with number two. Every time he says something that makes him laugh, he pauses to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with the last one". Then do not say it for the love of God. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central keep getting this madness in my throat that says it's a show that says it's more controversial than "The Da Vinci Code." You are not. You never will be. <br /> <br /> I was never offended by the content of the program. I would never give him so much credit. It offends me that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to shout unnecessarily. Yes ... I am literally offended by that fact.
