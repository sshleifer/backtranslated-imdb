I saw this in the theater a couple of decades ago, and a confusing memory suggests that I liked it. However, to see it for the second time, two things stand out: (1) very bad performance of Michelle Johnson, and (2) very poor music in everything. <br /> <br /> It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine, but the main song and others that resonated along the way reminded the worst of pop music of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice seemed all wrong, possibly dubbed. This was a distraction. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it's interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better and (4) Johnson was I saw quite attractive in various stages of disorder.
