Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), a cult icon hammy, dies of a heart ailment (not before getting rid of an ungrateful assistant and commercial director of television, who disrespected him with showers of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students (they want to "invite him to dinner" ... they are great admirers). What these children (including young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff be resurrected by a means to wreak havoc on those who took him out of his resting place. <br /> <br /> The list of violent acts includes Radzoff sticking out a man's tongue, setting a woman on fire, lifting a coffin that crushes a woman's face, decapitates a man and incinerates another man I live in a coffin. A really strange soundtrack and an annoying haze envelop Radzoff's macabre activities. <br /> <br /> The silly hokum of Troma is limited by a very, very low budget and a slow pace of wwwww. The film feels much longer than it is. The movie is not really that bloody and we can hardly see much violence because the movie is often too dark. Sometimes, Radzoff is an ominous presence, but other times he seems really silly.
