Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a while ago, and I think I'll never be the same again. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually. <br /> <br /> Never before has humanity seen such a free change in makeup, for no reason. Or, similarly, both zombie makeup (?) So bad that it makes you feel hungry for those green Halloween marshmallows. <br /> <br /> Or on the contrary, an old lady naked. But then there was "The Shining." <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost has a bit of charm, like dialogue. The last picture of the movie is so silly that it can not be described. It's as if a drunken college student meets up with some friends and decides to launch a Bruce Willis-type dialogue along with (I suppose?) The adolescent dialogue of some Elm Street movie. The result is jarring, and it would be really fun if it was intended that way. <br /> <br /> Oh, what the heck. I will laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, get together with your friends and watch this. But make sure you're completely drunk first. Or you can go crazy. Especially if you are a university film student. <br /> <br /> Greetings.
