Going back to Frogtown was a difficult movie to track. Well, I fulfilled that mission and had been sitting on the shelf for a long time. I wish it stayed that way! First, Sam Hell, of course, is not Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a guy with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft for the part! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and amazing. Here, it is captured THREE times! What kind of hero is that? Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why do not we get different characters here? This was stupid! Lou Ferrigno stars in this film and is not even the hero. Common sense says: let Lou be the hero of the movie! Bad effects, bad acting, and only a forgettable movie. It's fun when they take pictures in Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole scene of the concert in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was fun and not a bad movie! I really wanted to like going back to Frogtown, but I just shuddered when the fight scenes started. This movie makes Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this or you'll be the one who sings "the cruellest, greenest and loudest turtle TV dinner!"
