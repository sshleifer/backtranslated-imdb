When I went to see this, I thought, I liked the first two and I thought they were very exciting, so this should also be good. INCORRECT! There was NO suspense and they do not explain about the new dinosaurs! When I finished seeing this, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but then it turned out that it was not directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through "the movements". I thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and I thought that nobody should lose their money to see it.
