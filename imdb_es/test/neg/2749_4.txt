As powerful as Phoolan's true story is, this book on which this movie is based came before she left Prison herself and had the opportunity to tell it. <br /> <br /> Supposedly based on her diaries, but she is illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> That said, some areas of the film are accurate and the performance is not bad, with some sensitivity shown. <br /> <br /> Really even though this story must be old in a television series. Much more happens in a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Read his autobiography. Highly recommended It is a fantastic story.
