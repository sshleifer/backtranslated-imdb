BEAUTIFUL, even more, I can say that I remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in memory) like a 16 year old boy. Mark Hamill was the walker of the older generations and he was not very good at that, he was worse at this. More soundtrack of Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is a movie as bad as the one I saw at the Arthur 2 on the rocks cinema. It's funny how that question "What is the worst movie you've seen?" It's easier than "What is the best movie?" which varies incidentally between The Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, Things to do in Denver, Goodfellas (Do you know what I like? This will fool you!) Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please never watch this movie or it will stay in your memory too!
