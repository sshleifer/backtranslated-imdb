If you are going to make a movie of any book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This film not only challenged the biblical story that has been told for thousands and thousands of years to children in one way or another, but clearly took liberties that probably no adaptation would ever attempt. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books for people to understand the story more if they read the books of what this "Ark of Noah" tried.
