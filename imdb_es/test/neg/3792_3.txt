This is a film with an excellent concept for a story, but it was diverted but a lot of clich√© sub-plots, characterizations and trite and unrealistic representations, and some downright implausible (and highly coincidental and, not to say, convenient as argument) points to bring the story to its inexorable end). <br /> <br /> The lack of something that marked the leadership as really gay, apart from some casual references to Crow Bar or that he is gay, was worrisome. It would not hurt to show her to do something, even if she was just going to meet a friend for a drink. <br /> <br /> It is worth taking a look and it has its merits. There is not much, even now, a few years after the movie premiered, in the sense of the films that feature both a gay protagonist, or an important gay plot, and that also deals with African-Americans. Therefore, it is worth taking a look. I would not look for it too much and I would not waste time looking for it. This is a rental, and not a premium rental.
