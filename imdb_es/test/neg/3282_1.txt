Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce about Loy (Irene) and his girlfriend, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador when her plane crashes. (That's really what should have happened with this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while waiting for her fianc√©. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy soon attract each other. The scene with the bear is so artificial. We knew it was a domesticated bear all the time. <br /> <br /> Complications occur when Clara appears. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara they should separate, when he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a space scientist to discover how this will end. Out with all that snow, it's too cold for anyone!
