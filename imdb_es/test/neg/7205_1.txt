I could not spoil this piece of shit if I wanted to. After watching Dark Harvest 1, I thought "this has to be the worst movie ever made", then I saw Dark Harvest 2 and that made me look a little better. Then I saw Dark Harvest 3 or I tried it too. The only thing I have to say is "when will this end?" Very bad acting and really bad special effects. The only good thing about this movie was the shot to the tit. Do not waste your time on this garbage ... And now I have to write 3 more lines to send this. I was going to sing a song, but I can not think of any now. But the movie finally ended (although it had an ending that could mean that they are going to do another of these)
