When I went to see this movie, let's not say that I had high expectations. But simply that I had little hope that this long-lasting feature had at least some of the hilarity and ingenuity of the "Da Ali G Show" of television. <br /> <br /> But as you might expect, this can not be translated from a half-hour TV show to a 90-minute movie. The film did not have any appeal, and completely resorted to juvenile sexual humor and the bathroom. Basically, I should have left it in the middle, but I was foolish enough to think that I could somehow improve in the end, how wrong I was. I loved the show but I hated the movie. This movie is only for those who find canine fellatio amusing ...
