The piranha starts as expected, the stupid white people will discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a moment that it could be a cannibal movie. It begins like so many others, showing nothing more than shots of the virgin Amazon jungle. For all I know, it could be Florida. At this point, imagine that some animal or native mutilation will appear. Instead, you get the talents of William Smith, who starred L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, whom he would describe as Jack Palance Light. He is bigger in stature, but not quite the goodness of Jack Palance. As for the natives, you really do not get that many. Where is the piranha? Should I even ask that question? Caribbean now hunts humans, I suppose. However, he does not pursue anyone until the end of the movie, he just stares at them. Caribe makes a career of one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a dramatic mode of Smokey and the Bandit. The challenge of the motorcycle occurs without any real reason other than a sequence of action. I can not say how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never really live, die? Would you mind Does anyone want to ride a motorcycle? Caution: this film contains an extremely dry appearance. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
