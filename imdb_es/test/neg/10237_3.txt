"The Racketeer" stars Carol (deprived of the "e" that used to appear at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman expelled from society because she left her husband for a violinist concert (Roland Drew) that since then he has become a low alcoholic, and divided between his love for him and the interest of New York crime leader Robert Armstrong (top notch). It is virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the first fans: rigid direction, motionless cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow delivery lines. At that time, the sound teams told the directors that their actors would speak each line s-l-o-w-l-y and that they would not start to speak their own line until the previous actor had finished theirs. Done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows the dictates of his sound recorder and systematically undermines the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had when they saw their latest films. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year in which, despite the problems of transition from silence to sound, did not they give us some legitimate masterpieces? "Hallelujah!" Of "Vidor", "Applause of Mamoulian", "Heroes of hell" of Wyler, "Ladies of leisure of Capra". everything, from directors with a strong enough will to tell the dictators of the sounding board to fill up and let their actors speak and act naturally. Too bad that Howard Higgin was not so strong; As it is, seeing a naturally accelerated actor like Armstrong go over the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can not help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
