"Shame" is the only word to describe this production of horrible laughter. From the blatant disdain of the source material (which will surely infuriate anyone familiar with mythology) to an insufficiently predictable production value, this complete miniseries is a train crash. <br /> <br /> The cast (which includes some good actors, to whom I feel pity) pronounces the illogical dialogue with the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. Even worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from the design of costumes and set design (blurring styles over time and space) to the score (which seems to imitate many recognizable classical melodies, as well as "El Lord of the Rings") . The most offensive of all are the visual effects, which by themselves prove that if you can not afford to do them well, WRITE them. <br /> <br /> It hurt me to see another legendary story, bastardized by a cheap "adaptation" Maybe someday, someone does it right.
