I was one of the "chosen" to see this movie in advance. <br /> <br /> First you must know that this movie is based on the videogame "Far cry", a really good game for its time (2004). Secondly, you should know that the expert in this movie is the big capsule. This is a man, who takes video games (site dungeon, bloodrayne, post, etc.) and makes movies with them (VERY horrible ...). <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw The "king swords: a dungeon siege queue" by Boll. there were so horrible mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes that play at the same time, 2 at the time of day and one in some way at night ...) <br /> <br /> so let's go "very "If you expect great action, forget it, really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are a long way from the real action, if you wait for a great story, forget it." Oriented by the not so bad story of the game, this movie is a Laughter The acting of the actors makes the movie in many moments fun, but in a not good way. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie for free, so do not make the mistake and pay for this garbage, it's one of my favorite movies for the bottom 100. !!!!
