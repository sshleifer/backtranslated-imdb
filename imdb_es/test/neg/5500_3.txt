This movie has a lot of potential, it's a great story and it has the potential to be very creepy. But, of course, Tim Burton does not make creepy movies, he makes funny movies. and I usually like Tim Burton's things. But I thought that this movie was very weak. The best thing about the movie (and it's really worth seeing for this alone) was the artistic direction: the film has an incredible intangible quality. The script was not good. It was boring in parts and confusing elsewhere, and there was no character building. I never cared that people were cut off by a headless being. I thought Johnny Depp had something good in his approach to the character, but since the script was weak he could not go too far with him, and was very irritated by the attempts of a slight accent in Christina Ricci's. parts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, unfortunately it is not a great movie and it is not worth seeing unless you are interested in art direction.
