I was hoping to learn something from this movie, but I was disappointed. This is Rommel and he praises him as a great general, but at no time in this movie did we have an idea as to why it was great. What made it so successful? Was it his drive, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a version of Patton that really delves into the character, but this was not so easy. Most of the dialogue is artificial and sensational, and it feels obsolete and artificial. There is a good action here and there, but not much. The end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plan to assassinate Hitler, was the most informative and probably the most interesting part. But as a history lesson about the best general in Germany, this was a failure.
