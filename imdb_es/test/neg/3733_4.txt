It's not even been two years since I first saw this movie, and yet I can barely remember anything from this movie. Needless to say, I found it VERY forgettable. From what I do remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. A talented cast is wasted on what I suppose was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if that is the case, it fails miserably. At best, this movie is slightly interesting. In the worst case, the omnipresent cloud skies are more interesting than the plot. If you like to watch movies where it always seems wet and cool, then I think you can find something you like in this image. Just try to ignore what is happening, because you can barely see.
