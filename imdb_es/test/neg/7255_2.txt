Thirty percent of this movie seems to be the prototype for the Map Channel. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then release the footage in a big way as they drone (droning, do you understand?) On the radar. Apparently there are many radar stations in the far north, protecting the borders of North America from the attacks of deadly polar bears. The bears never appear, but a giant Mantis does. It was frozen in the ice for more than a million years, until it was produced by an earthquake in another part of the world (yes, of course, for my money, it was released by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect, and it needs a lot of food. As there are no cows in the frozen north, he decides to delight himself with the most bovine creatures he can find there. I.E., human beings. Start attacking the radar stations, probably because the buzzing radar antennae was getting nervous. <br /> <br /> Enter Colonel Joe Parkman, the resident man of the movie. He's investigating a plane that crashed, and he's surprised why there are no bodies in the wreckage. All he finds is one of the claws of the Mantis. Apparently, he decided to trim his nails while eating the crew of the plane. Parkman takes the tip of the claw back with him to be analyzed by a thousand-year-old scientist. <br /> <br /> The scientist of the grandfather can not make faces or tails of the claw, mainly because he has missed his naps, so he does not think t works too well So he calls a presumed palaeontologist interpreted by the guy what was the PI In Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he decided that the claw should come from a religious Mantis. Only one the size of a commuter train. <br /> <br /> It's Luke's warm love at first sight when Col. Parkman looks at the photographer for the first time. The men at the base, obviously having been deprived for many years, believe that it is the hottest thing that has happened since Granny Clampett. A presumed science man and a soldier soldier begin to work together to follow the path of the Mantis, which has devastated some images of an Eskimo people. Arrive at the base in search of a snack after dinner, and crush some cheap sets quite effectively. Then it flies to the south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now come the tense hours when the core of the civilian observer is called to sweep the skies in search of something big flying overhead. I doubt that they had actually been told they were looking for a giant flying mantis that feeds on humans, since that would have caused a panic. They were probably told to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and buzzing because its engine was not tuned. <br /> <br /> Col. Parkman gets on a plane to try to shoot down the Mantis and ruins the mission. The Mantis lands in New York City, probably because he wanted to see a Broadway show or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army cornered him in the Tunnel, and Parkman and his men put on some stupid costumes that they borrowed from the Orkin Man to enter and try to blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost, since the Mantis is still moving enough that it almost kills Eve Arden's photographer lady. There is a warm love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a photograph of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Mrs. Gender Unspecified are busy kissing. A final so nauseating.
