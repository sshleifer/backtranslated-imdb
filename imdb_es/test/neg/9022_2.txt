This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he played a leading role. It is incredibly bad. The edition is especially horrible; It really seems that the editor (if there was one) literally took pieces of film from the floor and pasted them. The opening must be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have shrunk every time he was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies, but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan.
