In fact, all those responsible for this dreck should be whipped, dragged and hung. IF this is what is the great drama of Eugene O'Niell, as if he never wanted to be a victim of seeing him again. There are so many INCORRECT things with this characteristic, where does one start? First of all, Elmer Bernstein's grandiloquent note is present throughout the film, even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts the motivations of the character. Second, these characters are NOT nice people and, although some critics like it, I personally dislike all the scenes in which Ives ate the landscape, but that was the way they wrote their characters: I did not like them. W / Loren, is it never clear if she is good or bad? And all your babbling about how you're going to change things the way they were before the baby arrives? Well, I saw what was clear. Perkins is a villain and then plays the role as a warm up for Norman Bates (who played two years later), even wanting to take over the murder at the end. Hokey! Third, this film is a studio production of sound on stage and suffers for it. The story would have benefited from the shots in the place to develop a sense of "place" with respect to the farm (in which all the main protagonists are fighting). As it was filmed, the property has no sense of value because the movie has a sound studio environment that is not convincing. This is a really horrible movie.
