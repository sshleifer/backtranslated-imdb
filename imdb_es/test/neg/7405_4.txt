As I am a fan of hospital and medical shows, I have found this exciting and sometimes humorous (especially in the scenes with Dr. Whitman), which brings a bit of relief. However, I was expecting the last episode because I hoped that the bad guys would be punished and the good ones reincorporated. Instead, the hospital administration is becoming even more foolish in an incredible way and it is getting worse and worse for the good guys. You can not help but wonder what the unions are doing or if Rob, Donna and Maria do not know what the unions are for. Also, I never see the outside, the trees, the grass, the sunlight is a bit oppressive. Did anyone understand what the last words were? that is, the answer that Rob Lake gave to Mrs. Strawberry's children: "Why does he tell us all that?" It was very frustrating not being able to understand it.
