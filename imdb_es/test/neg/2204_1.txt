This movie is an incredible piece of shit. First let me talk about the professionals: Sandra Bullock in a black swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is pretty bad. We have said that the computer programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL - ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ On the Internet and then put a chimney on your monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown so far.) This is after she finds a virus in a Macintosh program that locks the entire system after pressing the escape key. , this is a HUGE problem, but the virus created to do that could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> Any event, we move on. She gets this call from another type (which works in the same company) and this fool says to click on this symbol that apparently opens a secret Internet gateway to a bunch of data "top secret" unprotected woohoo! Ang She keeps this shit on a record and now the people who created this escape are trying to catch her. This, of course, only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps into the ocean from her boat, BEFORE she goes to a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You can not create a legal vacuum on the Internet to gain access to a lot of secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even at 95)? Problem # 2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would discharge her. She could not just pack her things and leave. <br /> <br /> Then these 'hackers' or whatever Angela's ID has changed so that she can not get help from anyone and conveniently, all of her identification is gone. So go home and the cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all the cops and the FBI are stupid and do not believe him. Then, she has to use a lot of tactics to enter the building where she works (where the person is now preparing for her) and go back to her old computer. She starts talking to another guy at random and discovers who is behind everything through some BS IP address. The director knows that the audience is stupid enough to believe. <br /> <br /> Then run to some center to mail everything. This information to the FBI. Apparently you HAVE to use a mainframe to send emails to the FBI. But then the same fool who tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her into the water, catches her and goes back to attack the FBI (wtf?). But do you remember that great virus? Well, somehow, luckily he gets it and, although the virus only worked in the software, now it also works in the whole system. Shoot down the entire mainframe, which contains all the false information because the mainframe was sitting in the middle of some convention ... THAT HELL THAT CRAP! Anyway, the uber virus now works and Angela (the real one now) flees and then kills the evil guy with a fire extinguisher. He, of course, has a weapon, runs towards it, so he is 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is full of BS and garbage. Who does not know much about computers will be deceived into thinking that this crap is possible, but nothing is accurate with regard to computers or the network. And, honestly, I doubt you'll see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a central computer (* cough LMAO *).
