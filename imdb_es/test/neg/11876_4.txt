After a secret mission in Bucharest to reveal an international gang of arms dealers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of a Romanian mafia accountant. However, the criminals break into the CIA security house and Sonni realizes that the information leaked inside the Agency. Alone, relying only on his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni struggles to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> The Wesley Snipes race is downhill. I just watched this movie, and it's another disappointing movie by this actor, whose career is currently very similar to that of Steven Segal. The movie has many explosions, shots and car chases associated with a horrible story and a horrible performance. First, the African-American Wesley Snipes is persecuted by the Bucharest police, but they never find a black American man. I've never been to Romania, but I do not think there are many African-Americans in this country. His character does not like to bathe, he wears the same clothes for many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she has sexual intercourse freely, falls in love with him and shares her fortune with him. The boy who plays Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The Detonator")
