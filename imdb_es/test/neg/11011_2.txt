For me, this movie was simply confusing, slow and uninteresting. Why did the aliens choose to communicate through the ants? Has no sense. The ending was confusing and did not make any sense at all. In the end, I expected the ants to kill everyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. Even MST3K could not save him.
