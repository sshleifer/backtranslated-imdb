If you take the movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you'll have a good idea of ​​what the movie is about. The only problem is that the film lacks the production values ​​of both and represents mainly a cheap copy of the previous two. It is true that the movie has a lot of action, but it asks the viewer to suspend the belief. Nobody can fire a 50-caliber machine gun holding it in your hand, and lose everything to boot, nor can you shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and lose the entire group. There is also a problem with bad editing, when the school bus turns around, it is quite easy to see the cannon used to do the work. And the lady who drives the truck is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in actions and violence without meaning, the film is easy to see. But do not expect anything in the game with Thunderdome, or even with Steel Dawn, a bit cheap and vulgar.
