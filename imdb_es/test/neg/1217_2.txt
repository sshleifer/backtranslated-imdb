Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This wine came directly from the cookie cutter "Jaws", with some other strange clichés in good measure. I was interested to see this after finding something of him in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I guess I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and talkative, much of this killer shark movie takes place on land, which is not really surprising. It seems that the only method they had to show a shark is through the taking of a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and that is very bad ... most of the characters are so annoying that you really wish they were eaten. <br /> <br /> The theme of the "plot" a group of four children who meet a mysterious Indian on the beach one day while roasting sausages. The Indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to trace an ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... supposedly because they were too good to fish the ocean and the god of the ocean. worried that all the fish would be taken. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's also a good thing, because you would not know ... years later, a monster shark appears and begins to engulf people in the sleepy coastal community. When one of the four men is devoured by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill him ... especially because (big surprise here) authorities killed a shark and believe the threat is over. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Mandatory death scenes are incredibly tedious, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who fights with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van, then jumps up and says "I'm going They had a lot of nerves calling this film "Deep Blood" since you hardly see anything, only murky water, the actors handle their cliché papers as if they were all thumbs, There's even a hilarious sub-plot that involves a bad rocker boy who threatens our heroes with good friends, and then he gets good at the end to help kill the shark. <BR> It took me a long time. find this movie, it's quite dark, so I do not think there's a danger that a lot of people waste time on this, but if they attract you ... do not say they did not tell you!
