I guess the movie was based on a robust book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the filmmakers, perhaps the writer or director, were intent on creating an epic movie. But there really was not enough time to devote properly to developing characters or stories. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated secondary stories that could have been edited. <br /> <br /> By relating the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think the film explained any reason why the killing was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? The interesting part of historical films is to see personal motivations or emotions. In contrast, Katyn's assassins looked like automata, controlled in their entirety by Stalin, who sometimes appears framed as a sketch of coal. The representation of the Russians and Germans seemed completely one-dimensional. (The Poles are so angry with the Russians?) In addition to being poorly edited and partial or at least unrealistic, the choices of music and cinematography were mismatched with each other and with the film itself. I do not think you can actually film an epic war movie or a war event with a handheld camera. (But if the director opted for a story based on the character, perhaps focusing on one family, perhaps the manual camera approach would have worked better). And if you use really dramatic music, it must be better balanced for the type of shots made.
