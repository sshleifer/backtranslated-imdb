Ugh Pretty horrible. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets the best billing, but her character does not have a big part. Whose character is it, the child's aunt? Another user commented that she was naked in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Maybe there are some alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley has a larger share than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens, however. Carradine appears briefly in a monkish tunic reciting a vague dialogue. There are no other characters in the scene with him, even though he is composed of one species, or else there are shots over his shoulder that no doubt belong to another person. There is also a very bad picture of him on a cameo medallion (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent photo of him in a family bible. He evoked Jack-O originally, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell appears briefly on a television as a horror television presenter. Brinke Stevens is in the movie that shows "The Coven," in which she runs around a cemetery with a tunic. Obviously, there is more of Brinke's images as an additional feature in the double feature of Retromedia DVD Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood. <br /> <br /> Jack-O: what is it about? Damn if I know. A child is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and other children are scared by a woman who they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him to her house and offers to help her family with her garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-headed assassin appears several times to hold onto the branches while observing people, or holds his scythe in front of the camera and poses with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand holding things, and actually kills people. <br /> <br /> There are also some flashbacks of a western family or meadows, with the little boy playing the child in that family: his ancestors, I think. I think they figure in the background story of Jack-O, but I'm not sure how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is apparently the main character, but we do not really learn anything about him, except that he wears glasses. He has nightmares and will fight against the thugs, even if he will be hit in the process. He should have spent more time establishing his character. I could not care less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
