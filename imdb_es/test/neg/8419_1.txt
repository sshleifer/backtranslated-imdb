I saw this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, as it fails to capture the taste or beauty of the island, only the hot, dry and sterile elements. The film was boring, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot, or the lack of it. He had his moments, for sure; but it also makes it go to the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I prefer to endure another colonoscopy before returning to see this horrible disaster. It was so bad, I really could not sleep. There are quite a few "Eurotrash" movies that were obviously made without the supervision of an adult. This is one of them. On the positive side, who is Nadia Cassini? I've never seen a more beautiful leg game before. She is the only savior of this movie. <br /> <br /> The cruel boar hunt represented in the final credits was also disturbing. A boar that was thrown on someone's property (Malta has very few native mammals, all of them small: rats, bats, etc.) and then the dogs attacked them before they were shot. Oh, well, go to Malta anyway, despite this movie, it's a beautiful and colorful island; Rich in history and lots of fun.
