First, the Mexican werewolf title in Texas is misleading, as many others have pointed out. Actually, it is El Chupacabra, which is a creature similar to that of a werewolf, but in no way is it the same. <br /> <br /> Production and editing simply stink. When it was over, I probably could not give a very accurate description of exactly what the Chupacabra looked like, since every time I was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions) the camera became unstable and you could only see the face of the Monster clearly. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but that should be expected from a low-budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Along with the terrible production, the bad actors come. Now, a couple gives quite plausible performances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (everyone else), who seemed to have no emotion when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small town in Texas that kills local residents and a group of teenagers seeks to stop it. However, despite the fact that the plot is that simple, some holes in the plot managed to leak. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to make fun of her and laugh with your friends one night, this would be a very good one. My friends and I had a great time watching this. Probably the second worst movie I've seen, 1/10. Horrible.
