I do not know what moviegoers expect from today, but after 68 years of watching movies ... (Well, maybe I did not see many movies in the first 9 to 10 years, so I made 58 years of movies) I hope to be entertained, not bored with tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (any other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that present themselves with no other purpose in mind, but to show splashes of blood and shattered body parts. Surveillance is one of those movies made by people who DO NOT have imagination, little or no talent, a total inability to join scenes and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose has passed. That someone ever thinks that this was a worthwhile movie, when it's just the Hollywood crap is beyond me. As a combat veteran, I've seen violence, blood and gore, in many ways, and movies like We Were Soldiers is as violent as a movie, but it has a redemptive value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by people in a drug induced stupor, without writing ability, without management training, without experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents, setting up a stage to kill some stupid farce cops, etc. A piece of high-priced garbage that only an idiot could like ...
