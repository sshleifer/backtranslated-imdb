I found myself watching men with a frown puzzled by the reason why so many talented and resourceful comedians decided to get involved in a totally humorless film. when you have eleven eighteen more and you start losing friends in the water cooler. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can enjoy this movie if you're the kind of person who often makes practical jokes about dogs, brown bags and matches, or maybe participate in competitions of 'men' at night outings drinking vomit / pee urine, etc. when you're not back in your parents' basement hitting your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then "Sex Lives ..." is difficult to recommend. Maybe if you are really weird in masochistic cranial surgery and spend your happy afternoons slapping the elderly or watching the toilets to the fullest, you might think that a close up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution. <br /> <br /> I 'd Discuss the characterization, the narrative or the performances if we had not zoned completely after the extensive comparison of tuna / vagina.
