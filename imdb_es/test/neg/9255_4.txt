Well, well, finally a view of this underestimated movie. But you can not find a good copy, a terrible copy full of green drops, the editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has that terrible whistle and other times you can even listen to the camera recording. In general, it is too dark, it should be said a part of the time, but it is not. It's a bit slow, the first half of the movie is talking and making love with one another. It is even strange that the girls in the movies of the 60 never wear bras. When they enter the bedroom, it is all glory. Anyway, it is banned in the UK from 84 and is still on the list of video nasties. The reason is simple, it is bloody for your time. It really has some unpleasant dismemberments and it is creepy in some way due to the fact that it is filmed by hand. So with each shot the image is moving, things that do these days with steadycam. The Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but even better than other films of the time like Schoolgirls In Chains.
