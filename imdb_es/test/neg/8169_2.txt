Seeing "Baghban" is the equivalent of a movie of trying to eat out of a tub of saltwater caramel for almost three hours. This Indian film is a sentimental soap opera, sweet and sticky, that begins as "King Lear", continues with "Romeo and Juliet" in the central section, then returns again to "King Lear" for its end soaked in tears. Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could want in life: a wife who loves him, a family that loves him and a job he is about to retire from after a life of faithful service. Even though Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four adult children, they still act as if a pair of love struck the newlyweds, cooing and sighing, rolling their eyes and whispering sweet words. in the ears. Almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody family is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. Parents and children joke, laugh together, even perform elaborate choreography, song numbers and "spontaneous" dances together (as in many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama interspersed with a large number, in this case, too much large a number of musical sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows something about narration says that this unadulterated joy can not go unpunished for a long time, and that all that joy is simply the prelude to a terrible catastrophe destined to fall on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers. Knowing this, we spent the first hour of the movie with a fearful expectation, wondering what form that disaster will take when it finally arrives. The thunder occurs about an hour after the film, when Raj tells his children that he and his mother have decided to move with one of their families, leaving them to choose the children and their respective wives. Suddenly, like King Lear discovering the vipers hidden in the family, Raj discovers that his children are not as loving, disinterested and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably horrified by the prospect, the children, to thwart their parents' plan, create a plan in which Raj will go to live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; then they will be turned off until, finally, each of the children has had the opportunity to host both parents and then the cycle will be repeated to infinity. To the great displeasure of the children, the parents agree to the plan, although the two are deeply in love and have never spent a separate time. In this way, the second and most of the third hour is spent with the two older lovers (although married) who cuddle with each other, while their insensitive and insensitive brats do everything possible for their parents to understand how unwelcome they are in their life. homes. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with "Baghban" is that it lacks subtlety both in its narration and in its direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the almost vertiginous closeness of the family unit, is reflected so much in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of sentimentality. Then, virtually without any warning, the script lights a penny and turns the children into insensitive and self-centered monsters, and the parents into passive and weeping victims of that insensitivity. Raj and Pooja are too long on the tooth and are too self-sufficient to be doing a little unrequited love, dreamy eyes, more appropriate for school-age children than parents of four adult children. The purple prose style, in which each emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to an intense overexploitation and a great dependence on the cheesy reaction shots and the melodramatic music for the score. The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy at the beginning, but continue for so long and appear so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and only serve to fill the material to unfathomable proportions. At least one full hour could be eliminated from this bulky production without any noticeable damage being done, and quite good. There's really no reason why this movie should go on for three hours. The most atrocious thing of all is the endless harangue to which we are subjected at the end, a speech in which Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) gives us a lecture on the truths of relationships between parents and children for Ten minutes at a time, at least. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a cheesy, cheesy saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a giant box of See's chocolates. Show at your own risk.
