I really wanted to like this movie, because I love Troma and I loved the trailer and I loved "Ghouls", another of Ferrin's films. It had some almost good moments, like the love song of the old ones playing in the scene of the car accident, and a scene near the end where the protagonist closes. But overall, it was just boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" crashes that Ferrin produced were really predictable and exhausted. Caca, murder prostitutes, incest. It could have been good, but badly done. I'm not sure if he was trying to offend, have fun, or both. Finally, neither of them. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION, we see Troma movies because we want movies with hearts. This movie did not always feel like it had a heart. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and unpleasant.
