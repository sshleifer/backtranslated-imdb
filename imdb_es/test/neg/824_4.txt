If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is immensely better. It does not have a masterpiece, but at least it's a movie. Borat is total garbage and I do not understand how he qualified better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can not point it out, there is something wrong with the script of Ali G: half of the jokes are as if they were written by a young man of 15 years, not by an adult screenwriter. And a series of jokes, including Mr. Cohen's lower body, are quite insipid. <br /> <br /> But the film is actually presented as a comedy and there are also some valid jokes that are funny: for example, how Ali G becomes a member of the government for doing something outrageous and stupid in the audience ( unfortunately true in today's Western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), as well as Ali's advice on immigrant politics and some others. <br /> <br /> In general, Ali G is still a sympathetic character, although he is a type of underdeveloped mental for his age. But it's good to look, it's pretty fun. <br /> <br /> But never see Borat, it is horrible and sick to all smart phones.
