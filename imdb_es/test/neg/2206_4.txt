This was a modest attempt at a movie, although it looked more like a television pilot. <br /> <br /> Some may find this unfair, but it seems that someone saw "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance", and thought "Hey, I could do that too". Well, not at all. <br /> <br /> Although I personally found that the film was predictable, something badly acted and contrived (watch out for cookies), Carl Payne proves that he can take a leading role, and should come back. in TV. The protagonist (I do not remember her name, I'm sorry) was also plausible, but you're still thinking about Julia Stiles (she was "Save the Last Dance", right?) Because this one was really stuck in "the white girl" "mode .
