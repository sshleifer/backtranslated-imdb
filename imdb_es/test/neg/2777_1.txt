I'm not sure I've seen a movie as bad as this one. Horrible acting, plot all over the place, terrible special effects. There are some "as bad as good" moments here, but not enough to maintain interest. The woman who plays Tracey looks horrible. There are some pretty disturbing scenes with a dwarf that make you feel slightly violated. On the positive side, the scenes of operation are quite fun for special effects, as is the pursuit of a car in which a car is "trying to force us out of the road" without making contact. I guess the budget did not extend to the garbage of the cars. Oh, and what looks like a postcard of the Taj Mahal, is shown every time they cut the foreign fictitious country.
