I will not lie, I rented this movie because it was an "artistic" movie with a possible explicit sex. I got that scene and the breasts of Catherine Deneuve (shown briefly), but the rest of the film is just the usual and pretentious European cinema with lines like "Did I have a mother or father, I do not know" (paraphrased)? Usually, they are delivered in long soliloquies. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the transition from "art" to porn, it could be an interesting aspect, with the use of the fast forward button (it was still too slow!)
