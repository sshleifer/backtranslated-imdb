This movie is painful. That is probably the best way to describe it. It's 93 minutes of your life that you can never go back. Well, they're actually more like 86 minutes because there's no way that anyone wants to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces. Immediately we can say that the film is from the producer of "Mortal Kombat", due to its sound and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains the few pleasant and fun moments that this movie can give you. The rest is exhausted by completely disinterested and annoying characters, the "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting", the acting skills of everyone involved (including the evil Christopher Lambert) and non-existent management. Did I leave something out? Of course I did it. Do not forget the script that induces suicide, with a funny dialogue (?). Oh, yes, and let's also talk about how they embarrassed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. The disguises and the weapons (were those gigantic pizza cutters that I kept seeing?!?!) They are just stupid, that's the best way I can describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always horrible CGI. When will the filmmakers learn that CGI stinks? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, episode 1: The Phantom Menace" make us want to be brought back. Finally, avoid this movie as the newest Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie. On the other hand, if you like the Freddie Prinze, Jr. movies, then you deserve to sit through this horrible excuse to make movies.
