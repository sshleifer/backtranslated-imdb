If possible, I would have given this unfortunate excuse for a movie a ZERO star. It was, by far, the worst I've ever seen. It was as if it were a home movie that some bored high school students decided to make as a joke. The "acting" was horrible. The "actors" did not even react to the fact that they were being killed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. The title in Spanish said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought hmm maybe it's okay. Incorrect. Honestly, it was the worst of all. I did not spend 20 minutes of the stupid movie. I skipped the chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen. <br /> <br /> The cameramen were terrible too. It was like a home movie. I would NEVER recommend anyone to see this. Terrible terrible moronic movie.
