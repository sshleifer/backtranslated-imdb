This movie was horrible and in the end it made me wonder why someone took the trouble to do it. Now it was not all bad, I studied film and this film was very well put together and had very good cinema, with interesting angles for a very nice lighting and an excellent camera work. I wish I had seen him at school because it would have been a good movie to write an article. BUT ........ Since I graduated and lost most of the pretension of my film, I realized that a movie should be entertaining above all, this movie was long and boring and I'm not sure when did it end? Point that was worth my time. <br /> <br />
