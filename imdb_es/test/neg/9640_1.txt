I find it terribly ironic that the "left wing" of Hollywood continues to cover their bets, making these terrible warm films that do not condemn the war on terror nor accept it. <br /> <br /> If you are a survivor of the sixties and a committed pacifist, and you are expecting a total condemnation of the war as BORN JULY or ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, this movie will really feel like a fraud. None of these soldiers really questions this war, or any war, or the idea of ​​war. They only complain about having to do another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really feel like a scam. . None of these soldiers loves America, does not even love the service. The way they pout and get angry makes them look more like suburban teenagers than men with hard blue collars. It's not SOLDIER, and it's not ARENA OF IWO JIMA. It is not even a meaningless action, and the scenes of war are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can not take this kind of film completely. Even though he is tremendously sexy, in a tough trade, in the men's room, somehow bisexual, it's hard to imagine him as a slow-talking Texas guy who wants to stand up and be counted. This is not a sergeant. Croft in Mailer's THE NUDE AND THE DEAD. It looks more like Joel in OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS by Truman Capote. He can not sell you with the idea that he has been in combat and done his part, or that he loves his wife and he loves her right now. He fizzles on the battlefield and in the scenes of the room, looking like he would rather duck and get a good attack from behind.
