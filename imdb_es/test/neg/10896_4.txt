Something is happening in this film directed by the scribe John Shiban of X-Files that has eluded me. You have the feeling that, as the film progresses, not everything is as it seems, but I feel that the film fails to give you enough to continue to really care for you. It is about perception. There are characters that the heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) finds in the film that speaks and disappears. This may seem like a spoiler, but it is something that really only inherits a little the focus of the filmmakers. They seem to mock us as we watch curiously if we should trust what Nicole is seeing or not. He never receives an adequate response and, for my part, he had no idea how to get there. There comes a moment in a movie in which ambiguity can be frustrating because the viewer is guided in a wild chase that ends in a dead end with little explanation of what we have just seen ... ultimately, it feels like a exhausting exercise instead of an exciting psychodrama. Now there is nothing wrong with ambiguity, but give us something to cling to or evade. This is how I felt when I saw "Rest Stop". This film is supposed to be about a young girl named Nicole who decides to go to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to succeed in Hollywood. They do what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that Nicole can pee, but falls in terror for her when she discovers that her Jesse is completely gone. Someone in a dusty, dusty yellow truck is a madman who seems to be causing Nicole a lot of trouble and we soon realize that he is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start to happen, signs that will be provided if he wants, she You will have To find a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and has limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with strong evidence of how evil she can be. <br /> <br /> That's the easy part. When a female character comes into play, the film takes a really strange leap into logic, since we're not sure where it came from, how it got there and, more importantly, where it goes once Nicole tries to free her from her supposed prison. In the bathroom utility cabinet. She meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem like her savior, but when he is also a victim of the truck driver, things happen again that ask if he was ever there to begin with. The driver of the truck commits tortuous acts to Nicole (like locking her in the bathroom and while trying to untie a cable that the killer wraps around the door lock, receives an unpleasant bite from him). Then, he sets fire to the bathroom, leaving it without a lasting place of refuge for the beast. <br /> <br /> It's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that makes me listless. Maybe she just likes to torment her, but she appears appropriately in certain situations where Nicole has time to run away or prepare. It does not make much sense, his motives, that drive the film to an illogical idea. Why is it so obvious? Why does it allow you to prepare? It seems that I am taking a risk, that he likes that his quarry believes that he can find a way to escape only to crush that hope when his next scary attack comes his way. However, why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by having Nicole experience strange meetings with people who do not exist? What is Shiban trying to say and the writing team? And, to end the deranged rarity of the movie is a family in an RV. They play a small role in the scheme of things as religious fanatics, but the film is not enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film.
