The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to do much more than this, using the lies of the title to provoke all kinds of small turns, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really quite messy though Fellowes does not seem interested in presenting the elements of the thriller in a way that will keep us on the edge of the seat. Rather, his focus is on the moral problems themselves. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inconsistent, scenographic here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich√©-landmine. Although there are no problems with the locations so that the actors can continue to exist in their space, the terrible score can not create an additional dimension and often works against the emotional impulse of certain pieces. There is also a prosaic very prosaic, I dare say that it feels British to the shooting. I did not want to see a document of two successful middle-class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some kind of witty storytelling. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is, in fact, the Story that drops the rest. Just as the elements of suspense are quite flat, the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and the exuberant colleague of John Warnaby, Simon to Wilkinson, is a welcome addition to much of the frown. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed; It's not that it's bad, it could have been much better. 3/10
