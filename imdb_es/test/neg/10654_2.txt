This movie is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a sincere teenager with the power to save the Chinese who pitied, the film did not show any convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot made no effort to show us more than cheap common sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it shows how a human can be arrogant . Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The performance and the stage were fine, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes, I hope I will not see this movie again in my life. Skip this one!
