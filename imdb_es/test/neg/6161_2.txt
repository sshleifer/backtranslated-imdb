This is a movie with a wonderful concept, but with a very weak writing. It should never have been released without at least three more rewrites (assuming one was obtained). The story stays too weak, and there are too many 90-degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie. It would be great to see what a decent screen writer with the story could do.
