This could have been an excellent movie. However, as many other people think, so do I. It is badly done due to the language transfer. If the whole movie should be read, then it moves away from the film and becomes something else. I have an excellent rating as far as I'm concerned and I could not wait to rent it. But, once I did it was a real disappointment. Here in Boardman, Ohio, I could not find an English version for anything similar. This movie was also compared to Dark Hours and we will not see it in Boardman, Ohio. Not available. So I guess we'll never know how good the movie really was.
