The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog, where they will kill a gangster for showing some sign of weakness because they become a responsibility. I have no problem with the human side of the gangsters who are portrayed, but Bugsy walks too far in the direction of the soft and comical men. The movie is nice, but it's just a light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, although exciting, was extremely dangerous and scary. <br /> <br /> The performance is good and the direction is very solid. The places and the time are very well represented and the topics very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
