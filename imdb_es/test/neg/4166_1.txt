This movie was released in all the major theaters in Australia. I watched the movie on the weekend of August 7 and I thought it was absolute nonsense (and I am using that word very dismally). How it premiered to all the big cinemas no idea. The plot seemed simple enough about how the world was divided into subclasses and people needed identity cards and actor Tim Robbins played an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee who steals ID cards, which turns out to be the actress Samantha Morton <Br /> <br /> You think that from that summary, the rest of the story should be interrupted, but it does not confuse the audience even more with a different story that is not related. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about watching this movie, let me save you the problem. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE.
