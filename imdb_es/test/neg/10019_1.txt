This is truly, without exaggeration, one of the worst Slasher films ever made. I know, it came out in the 80s following a trend initiated by "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the aforementioned film in many aspects. The forest, the murderer, the sleepy teenagers, the gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect. I did not even remember it if it was not by coincidence. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer is actually human, so do not expect a supernatural killer like Jason. The situations are quite boring and lack tension, gore, violence, etc. It just does not work for a slasher movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is just horrible. The score is horrible! A combination of boring instruments with melodies of the 80s? I will not even mention the technical aspects of the film because believe me, it seems it costs only $ 20. <br /> <br /> Please, avoid this like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've seen, and that's something to say. Thank God it seems to have disappeared from the earth.
