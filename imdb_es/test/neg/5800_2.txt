This movie has NO plot. It was SUPPOSED that a boy moves in with his grandmother, and everyone thinks he is a loser and that he has to redeem himself. But what happens after everyone discovers who he is living with? They have a big party at Grandma's house. The climax of the movie was not even related to the rest. The whole plot was introduced a few minutes after the end of the movie. I can see how it COULD have been related to the supposed story, that Grandma's VG skills redeem it, but that just was not there. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was funny and clearly based on jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her pussy smells like the big depression" "He just swallowed his first tit ... yes, for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's the devil"
