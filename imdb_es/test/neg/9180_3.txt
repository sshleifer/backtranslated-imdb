Unlike most critics of this particular movie, I'm not really a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, to say the least. However, when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who has been demoted to clean bathrooms with a toothbrush and, what is worse, having to team up with Cynthia at the request of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster can always be seen, it is a real pity that the film itself is so trite and clich√©. It also presents one of the less terrifying villains committed to celluloid. Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more movies, the next would be "Down N Dirty". <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T & A; Mary Kapper goes topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Showtime Extreme
