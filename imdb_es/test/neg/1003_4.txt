This tale of the upper classes who have improved and wallowed in their upper class misery is like a contemporary version of an old Joan Crawford film in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave in a terribly civilized way in the face of adversity. A wealthy London lawyer, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only his wife has an affair with the local nobility, but also has killed the husband of his housekeeper in a flight and escape accident. He vomits, but, otherwise, his rigid lip hardly trembles. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park", (this is his directorial debut), from a Nigel Balchin novel, it's pretty comical, although I'm not sure how much intention comedy has. It's like a return to the British films of the forties, where all the characters behaved like characters in books or plays rather than as people in real life. However, not everything is bad. Wilkinson is great, even if you never believe in him as a person, while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high class totty) are very good at covering the cracks in the material. The photography of Tony Pierce-Roberts ensures that no matter how hard it is for the ear, it is always good for the eye.
