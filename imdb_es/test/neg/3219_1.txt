I'm a jerk for mob / gangland movies, so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train collision. With all the renowned actors in this movie, I can not believe how bad it was. It was so bad, I started to laugh hysterically towards the end of the movie. The actor best known as Zues or the great guy in the movie "Friday" by Ice Cube makes an amazing performance over the course of the film. The first thing I said to Blockbuster when I returned the movie was to remove this garbage from its shelves. Do not rent this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your life. If they come out with a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first one. I will be more cautious when renting the so-called 'mafia / gang' movies.
