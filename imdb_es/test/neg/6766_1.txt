Yes. A real stinker. I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. This movie does everything possible to not be understandable. I was aware that I was stinking after seeing the first 20 minutes. I waited because I expected to see something valuable and, most importantly, PAID for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After watching the film, I spoke with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments (they call themselves with this title) of Turkey, this "movie" had been recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the stinky category. I think a movie should explain itself. This movie is the opposite. Stay away from this thing that calls itself "movie". Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 of 10
