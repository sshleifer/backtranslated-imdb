*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's happening here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey, looking decidedly unappealing, as if she had stolen her grandmother's spare wig, presents an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man with whom she has had a adventure 'in self-defense' after having beaten her forty times with an ax. <br /> <br /> Like Lizzy Borden, she is acquitted but after all. unconvincing argument presented before a jury by the representative of a supposedly "innocent" defendant I have seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took an ax and gave forty hits to her father When she saw what she had done ... she declared in self-defense <br /> <br /> I do not believe it <br / > <br /> I find the defendants guilty of presenting an unconvincing image and I have no alternative but to give this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 (which would have been lower, but due to the good previous behavior of some of those involved) <br /> <br />
