The St. Francisville experiment states that "this is not a walk in the woods," a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a movie that overloaded the viewer's imagination through a simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement exaggerates the viewer's patience. It must be said, however, that this is meant to be a classic of the camp. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler is coming! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a local theater where the "paranormal consultant" of the film, Troy Taylor, talked about the making of the film. If someone wants to see this movie without knowing the information that is coming, stop reading here. For those of you who can not resist, read my friends and you will be told to everyone. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer of fairly intriguing ghost stories that he claims to be true, informed the audience in this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we did not know ... He informed us that all the terrifying discoveries made by the participants were organized and pre-established by the producers of the film. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but in California. The four participants were real actors (note that I did not say anything good ...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician in the emergency room. <br /> <br /> What infuriates me about this movie is that it proclaims that everything is true. It tries faintly to overcome the project of the witch of Blair saying that it is certain, whereas the witch of Blair was a deceit. The surprising thing is that nobody could believe this movie for a moment. Filled with spooky performances and hilarious lines like "surround yourself with white light" and "I love ghosts", the St. Francisville Experiment belongs to midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can heckle, boo, mock and sing "I love The ghosts! "<br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising. True stories are not recorded with organized special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scout troop establishes a haunted house. From the insect in the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) to the annoying Madison, from the "session" which is nothing more than the four-person game on an Oujia board to the two mice that are underneath. the bed, the St Francisville Experiement is a shameful hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to throw this thing into the nearest trash compactor or announce it as it really should be: <br /> <br /> "The St. Francisville Experiment: a comical look at how not to make a movie".
