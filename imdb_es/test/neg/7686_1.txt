I only saw the first twenty minutes of this film and personally I think that this is the worst movie that has been made in recent years. <br /> <br /> The argument was so bad that it could have been possible for a 10 year old boy to write it. The performance was also neglected with a fairly unknown cast and not just because the action sequences, especially in the first half of the movie, were so terrible that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the producers got the budget to film this movie, but the production company must be regretting it now. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can find this movie in the near future, I advise you to avoid this joke of a movie. .
