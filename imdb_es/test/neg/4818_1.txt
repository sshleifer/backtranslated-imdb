As a native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the atrocious dialect of the N'Awlins to the highly creative "manipulation" of the geography of Crescent City, is horrible. This is another of those Big Hollywood films that decides to stereotype New Orleans as: 1. A city full of idiots that sound in French 2. A city full of people who sound like they've just returned from the summer house of Blanche Dubois 3 A city of drunks, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. A city of deep mystery, where almost all practice or are victims of voodoo (I admit that maybe we are a city of drunks, but every day is not Mardi Gras) . "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I would not recommend it to anyone.
