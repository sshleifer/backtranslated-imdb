This movie is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful only on a high budget. It is obvious that a lot of time and effort was devoted to this: the animation is fluid, detailed and excellent; the soundtrack is not memorable, except for the final song of Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). The musical score is a powerful full orchestra material. Congratulations to the animators and music composers! 9/10. However, the story and the characters fall flat. It feels very 'been there, done that', predictable and clearly uninteresting. The characters have different personalities but nothing too pleasant. They bothered me until the end. I tried very hard to like this, but I did not care about the story, it was an argument of action and adventure. There were 'jokes' that were not funny. It was inducing predictable vomiting from start to finish. The dialogue was clich√© and horrible, especially the last line "It's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it is, I remember that I shuddered. I was wishing he would hurry up and finish. I was not the only one either, the people I went with thought I was bored. Please, watch the movie of Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra if you are going to see any. This was a waste of time.
