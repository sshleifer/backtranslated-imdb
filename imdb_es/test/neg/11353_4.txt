"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can not consider it a bad movie, but the development seemed too hasty and not credible to evoke emotions. Dr. Fermín shows unprecedented bizarre behavior due to a passion that one can not really understand where he was born from. I mean, how many times do you have a conversation with Mararía? Maybe once? In addition, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, but rather a stereotype of a movie that only needed to be in the film (... or else another title was needed?). Some of the best performances came from a role that was not really important for the story, that of Marcial, the subinteligent but humble drunk. Of course, the landscape, the cultural curiosities of the Canary Islands and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film did not become a documentary (in case it was their real intention) and, most importantly, as a drama solid.
