The only good thing that this movie created was that I became hungry for ice cream, without the parts of the dead body that it contained. The movie is one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time. When the "King of the Icecreams" died at the beginning, I was laughing a lot because the boy took the ice cream and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and he should have said, "Leave me alone and let me eat the ice cream for free so I can see how my acting career is going down the drain at a young age." That seems right for a line. Then I wondered why the prince of the ice cream was behind the bars of his ice cream truck. Was someone going to steal your twenty cents? I've never seen bars in the window of an ice cream truck. It seemed pretty stupid. It is better that you forget the performance because it is horrible. Forget about this movie and go to the dairy queen and get an ice cream.
