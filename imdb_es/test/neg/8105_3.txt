Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs trying to disrupt the American war effort from within. It is quite difficult to understand at first because, although we know that these guys are up to something, their method of operation is not very clear. I will not spoil it, but the ending is quite surprising. There is a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that does not know what is happening. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like: "A true patriot would do this or that". It is obvious that while suspicions abound, most of the world would not know a spy or a subversive if they jumped and bit them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized that he never did anything but sit on a horse. There is, of course, the sufficiency of the offenders, since they think they are immune to the murderer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy in one. The best scene in the movie is in the end, but I will not spoil it. As a curiosity and period article, it can be fun to observe some people.
