Honestly, I have not seen this movie for many years, but the few times I tend to make some parts remain in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I saw him for the first time as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early sixties, and he scared the kids so much, in a fun way. I remember that I felt a genuine anxiety for the unknown that lurks in the labyrinth. I can not risk delivering the ending, except to say it was surprising, to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole audience of young people who let out a big frightened cry, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes of a movie in film history, and yet, curiously moving, in some way. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I do not know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still be an excellent Halloween feature for children and adults.
