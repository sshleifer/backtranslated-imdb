The cover of the DVD explains the premise: "Three problematic teenagers go to jail" and are "prepared to make time until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him, undercover." The movie starts with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad," so you do not have to search for them in the dictionary. To get a visual definition of "Cool," look for photographs of the original trio: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A black one. One white One blonde Once they defined great. <br /> <br /> The three that make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Squad" are in their twenties: Claire Danes (as Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (as Linc Hayes) ). They are not able to do much with the given material. The portrait of Mr. Ribisi is the most "distant", which means that it deviates more from the original characterization. Mrs. Dances romances Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites), who looks like he might be in a remake of "Marcus Welby, MD". You will not believe strong Michael Lerner dancing with Mr. Epps "Linc". He explains: "I'm not a fairy, I just like to dance!" and asks, "Make me turn!" <br /> <br /> *** The Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
