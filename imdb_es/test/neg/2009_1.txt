Hmmm! Is it the worst movie in history? Well, for some of the actors it's a shame to see them in a movie like that, but hey, if you pay the bills, why not? As for the movie too. OK cg the effects are not so bad for such a cheap movie, the music is again good for a cheap movie, the final credits are fine hahaha <br /> <br /> BAD for many on the list but, cast, the acting, the sets, the script, ending ... what the heck, Drac .......... the worst Drac EVER!, many more, but you can not bother to leave them all. <br /> <br /> The idea was fine but it was necessary ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and changing all the negative points, I do say however, to see this movie so you can say "What that the FU% $ was all about "how the credits run. It is also your something that you have to see just to see how bad it is.
