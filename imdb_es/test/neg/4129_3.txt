"Three" is a seriously foolish shipwreck movie. Masked as a psychological thriller, his closest relative is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also with Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well-drawn characters to encourage them in the form of the grieving parents of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman who were trying to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrified by the psycho-killer adrift of Zane. It provided a sharp, increasingly accelerated suspense, a sense of claustrophobia in the open sea as the cat-and-mouse game of life and death developed. take care of what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of suspense or emotion and some hits, hammy performances of the main players. Zane, in particular, goes way over the top in an irritating way. In "Dead Calm" he was threatening, bound and agitated with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is grandiloquent, petulant, slimy, and untangled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of cigarettes and dried cigars? And why your lighter remains full of juice for more than a year? Ms. Brook is very picturesque, incredibly pretty, but both her chest and her bottom seem to have been inflated excessively by some kind of liferaft bomb. However, they are successful in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of them. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, is not. The boy who played with Manuel, the third component of this sad triangle, could have been replaced by a piece of floating wood, nobody would notice. In fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to engage in meaningful or dynamic dialogue, Driftwood represents a potential improvement in the cast (excuse game). <br /> <br /> More sides: the stage is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I guess this had a very limited theatrical release (if there was one) or went directly to the rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something decent in this sense, get "Dead Calm". It was made by people who knew a little film.
