This movie is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen, probably among my 5 best movies. I laughed once and that was when: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a hairdressing salon" <br /> <br /> That was literally the only time that I laughed in this "comedy", horrible compared to Bruce Almighty, that as a big fan of Jim Carrey ... it was not even so good! <br /> <br /> This movie lacked the humor of having the powers of God and had more to do with the family bond. I classify it only as a family movie, definitely not as a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing a bird poop on someone's shirt is not funny, neither is a beard that grows back instantly! <br /> <br /> I did not even think the special effects were great, the animals seemed really stuck, it was like watching a movie that had not "stuck" properly <br /> <br /> 2/10 movie: Avoid it!
