Writer / director Brian Burns has obviously seen some romantic comedies, and seems to think he has discovered the formula of success: many location shots in New York (preferably in the winter), allusions to old Hollywood movies (especially musicals), Band pleasant musical sound. Unfortunately, all this is a mere compensation for Burns's lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many writers and directors who make independent films is not the reason why they can not go ahead with the main studies, but the way they get the backing of their films). <br /> <br /> Normally, our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the main characters, but the couple in this movie simply has no appeal. This is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; His characters are badly written. What we answer in classics like When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or in older films like His Girl Friday are details and defects of the personalities of the main characters. Lacking the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us a special after school inspired by Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus. <br /> <br /> How someone can see Burns as Woody Allen's successor is beyond me. I did not laugh once during this movie, and the screen game is filled with an echo camera dialogue ("I want to paint the city red." "Do you want to paint the city red?"), Which is the most revealing . Sign of someone who does not have business writing to make a living. In one of the first scenes, we see the girlfriend of Krumholz actress filming a meaningless television comedy. It's the only moment in the whole movie that the dialogue feels good; Maybe that indicates what Burns's talents are really good for.
