The film has strange annoying characters, inexplicable slapstick strangers, and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. The film has an artificial argument of the search for love of a malicious woman with an empty head (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Although who would like the character, personality or reading of Jeanne's dialogue, I really can not say it. Except that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting performance of a character (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does everything he can to look beautiful and touching (while smoking). And, hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she is not really enough so that no one cares about her. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time for anyone. I do not even know how I could sit through the movie as much as I did. I can not even believe that I spent the time to write this, except to warn others of its banality. Does anyone need a cigarette?
