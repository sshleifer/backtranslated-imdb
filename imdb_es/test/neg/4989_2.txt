Let me start by saying that I never wanted to see this movie in the first place; I had to see it one day, and I thought that I guess I could lighten up and enjoy what it is, and it could be entertaining. What I got with that expectation was one of the worst movies I've seen, without exception. First of all, there was no humor in the least. The creators expected the humor to be laughable / passable if they included sarcasm in all the lines that come out of the mouth of Underdog and they use scene after scene of soda, they interpreted aspects to "enchant" the audience on the happy side, while still making them "ooh "and" ah "for more with boring action scenes and insipid and mediocre presentations that made me want to shout at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it. The performance was boring, the humor was tedious and the characters / plot felt that they spent about 10 minutes creating their complete personalities, which gave uninspiring actors and actresses the ability to portray their characters with the least depth. This film is simply and simply horrible in all fields, and in reality only children under 10 years old will be able to enjoy it, which, despite being the age range to which it was addressed, does not justify it for being so stupid and silly . That I feel so penitent. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best recent family / children movies, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this crap!
