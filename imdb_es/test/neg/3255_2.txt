This movie sucks. It is awful. If someone liked it, those people should reach the heads examined. The character of Jackie Mason sounds like a retard. That guy who tries to kill the Gopher is a loser and he sucks. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, it was not funny. This movie had crude and funny jokes and it did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Although the character of Jackie Mason had the personality of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was fun! I should have returned! I do not care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have come back too. The original Caddyshack was the performance of Murray's career. If it was fun in the first, it could have been fun in the second. <br /> <br /> Final comment: I recommend this movie for ... NO ONE! This movie sucked !!!! HAS SUCKING, NOW SUCKS, AND ALWAYS SUCKS !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
