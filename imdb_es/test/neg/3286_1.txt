The actors and actresses of this series are fine, but the scripts have been absolutely horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. In fact, the scripts often illustrate how not to be parents. The scripts are so bad that they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than this one. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is becoming a father, if he wants to see what not to do with his children, this program is the perfect guide. I think the trash that this show feeds us is beyond words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a solid guide and better, much better scripts than what I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generational, my teenager even turned off a show of this because they thought it was horrible.
