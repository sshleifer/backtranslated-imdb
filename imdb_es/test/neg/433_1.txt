Hello people, <br /> <br /> I can not believe that "Shades" of That Thing You Do took on this role. I do not think Cory Feldman would have taken this role. This movie was a pile of smoking manure. Save time and money, and see each of the 250 best. I swear I wanted to slap the Lady of Blockbuster for allowing me to rent this. Keep away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Mr. Hipp
