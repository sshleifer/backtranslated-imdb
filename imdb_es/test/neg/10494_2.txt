When the budget does not allow a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or Imperial car, we are talking about cheep cheep. That is the language of birds for cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> What's in the hair of a forty-year-old teenager? The guy who looks like a cement head who tries a couple of times to run over John Agar and provides the only scare in the film because of the approaching approach. His hair looks like a shoe. A patent leather shoe. He is a shoemaker. <br /> <br /> The nurse needs an emergency hair wash immediately. She has hairspray on her blond locks that would ignite if the production company could pay for lights. <br /> <br /> The monster? The music was more scary. I would try to run away from music. The monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast. Put some lipstick on that monster and you have Divine's older sister. <br /> <br /> Work and editing of the camera and the plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for bad music throughout. <br /> <br /> Hello Mr. Agar? We are thinking about making a sequel to Night Fright and ... Mr. Agar? Agar? Tom Willett
