There is only one reason why this movie is visible. Until Schweiger. He's such a good actor that the movie is not all that terrible. Uwe Boll please take another race. Special effects and action are acceptable. All the other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (One night with ...) talked about Tim Burton who never read Batman comics and showed up. Uwe Boll must never have played the videogames he keeps making movies about. If you ever want to know how it's done, go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best videogames for film adaptations of all time. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that ID kids have a lot to do with Doom. It does not seem that anyone in UBIsoft was even close to this production.
