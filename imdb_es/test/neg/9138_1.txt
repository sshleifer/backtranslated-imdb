I have seen the 3 now. I just can not believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison with others, but simply by its own merit, or lack of. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the average rating of this movie is more than 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were stimulating and very well done. I gave this movie a grade of 1. If there was a 0 or a negative number available, I would have given it that rating. What a total waste of time was watching this movie. I thought that after the first 30 minutes I should turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow movie to begin with. I thought the same after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that I was not going to get better. <br /> <br /> It is very tedious to see and without any redemption. Do not take my word, look at it. Make sure you watch the first two movies before this one. If you see this first one, I can guarantee that you will never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the credits play at the end. That is when his penance on this earth is complete and he can give up 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering he has endured when he saw this "movie". If God is truly merciful, he will be more generous.
