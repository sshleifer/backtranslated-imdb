I think South Park is hilarious, and I have no problem taking pictures of people from the left, but one would think, after taking a full movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers in an illegal war, and then being GASP immediately, they would have the sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. Bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys because he's stupid and messy. <br /> <br /> Gore is a fair game, but please, what do Republicans have to do, what's wrong with them? F j & ke around the country before these guys finally act like they're not trying to do the best they can, and they've made a real mistake ... or maybe they're going after Rush Limbaugh ... hes A good goal ... or just make fun of the hollow teeth of rice condoleeza.
