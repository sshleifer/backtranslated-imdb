This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. I tried to like this movie, but they managed to ruin almost all the individual aspects related to this movie! Cheap dialogue, without character development, without tension, without enough history to catch you, without action, apart from some REALLY cheap scenes. It seems that they tried some things on the set and said to each other "hey, this looks pretty good, why do not you put this there" after which the director probably said "Yes ... YES, this is great And I went back to inhaling coke or something ... When it comes to acting, I think that the only person who TRIED to make the film work is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it is useless because this movie sucks! 2/10
