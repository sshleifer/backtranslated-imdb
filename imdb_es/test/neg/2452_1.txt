When I think about movies for television, I always think about this movie, I've seen it several times on Sky Movies, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I saw this movie, I was just browsing and I found it here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming), goes on vacation, with her son (William Flemming), in this summer resort, are upstairs with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / bar owner?) , and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's like a strange romantic thing, William begins to fall in love with Kathy, and Paul falls in love with Linda. <br /> <br /> A man faints in a street, has a mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep-sea diver, who in some immersion, saw a light or something, and converted to religion ), says that it will take care of this person, there is a void in my memory, then there is a big gap in the virus, I think Linda offers her help, to find a cure, Kathy becomes infected (William notices a mark on the arm of Kathy), with the virus, so does Jos√©. <br /> <br /> Paul says some lines to Joseph, then Joseph stumbles, the next time you see Joseph, he was healed in some way, that information is used to cure the infected, then there's a party on the beach , the end.
