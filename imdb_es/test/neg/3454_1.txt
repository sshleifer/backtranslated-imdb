After having seen the first scene, I realized that the performance was so bad that I could not continue later. Shallow and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five-year-old child tries to make it look like he knows what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The story from the second to the second is completely unrealistic and almost every decision the scriptwriter made was what you expect from an under-grade elementary school student. The general plot was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent were limited to neurotic and apologetic behavior. A boy of ten could like it. But a five-year-old would have a hard time accepting a lack of realism; How advanced cell function allows someone to bypass a code lock by touching it like a magic wand? Choose one of every 100 voices through a ventilation system (thus cheating Superman), and repair a computer at home simply by detecting what is wrong instead of looking for faults? Actually, that scene is a good example: the fault was that one of the cooling tubes (aluminum tapes) of the CPU was broken, as it would look if an exhaust pipe in a V8 engine were to be started with a bang. This is something that can not happen, and if it happened, it would not stop the computer from working. There is no electric current to pass through this tape, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms worked with the autopilot because the cells of his body were super efficient) put a pin in the rip, a desk with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting. <br /> <br /> And so it goes all the way. Like when he escaped from an interrogation room at the NSA headquarters by lighting a lighter under a fire sensor, which resulted in open doors throughout the building. Naturally, the NSA did not predict this ingenious approach to escape, nor did they put guards outside their room (or anywhere else) to protect themselves from life, walking through military nanotechnology. So he went out and took a taxi. Examples like this are not only numerous, in fact there is not a single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, the so-called great effects were terrible. He threw a basketball at a child in the park, and the child was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized car. I am sure that if I stopped and looked for the cables that held this child's posture in the way only cables can, they probably did not know how to do it or bothered to erase them completely. If someone is thrown so far into a tree, at least they would say ouch (or rather they would be hospitalized with broken bones), but the child was simply confused and astonished. <br /> <br /> Moronic. That is the word for every creative decision made throughout the production. I'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone who is as unqualified as he can not improve. I want to demand compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life to see it, and the time it took to write this. Although he felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes for a pilot to be approved. The only excuse for an unintelligent person to have to do this voluntarily would be incarceration or lobotomy.
