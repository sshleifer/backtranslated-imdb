I was 12 years old when I saw the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!") That was a fun movie and not just for children. This horrible remake is pathetic even for a 5 year old! What possessed Disney to ruin its reputation and the memory of a lovely movie that I do not know and I can not believe it. Even the title song in the original film (both the original version and the dubbed Italian version) was extremely nice and created the atmosphere for the story. In this new version, the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was nice to see Dean Jones, although only for one appearance, he was a regular in the great movies of old Disney. Honestly I can not see anything more positive in this remade movie.
