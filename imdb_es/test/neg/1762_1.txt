<br /> <br /> This movie really has nothing in its favor. With the Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know they did not make any cuts and literally left the trash. It is a waste of good talent and a total shame. Terrible! <br /> <br />
