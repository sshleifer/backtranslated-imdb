This is possibly the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror film industry and I can believe that this movie could be made. The acting was youthful and the story completely idiotic. The camera work was also youthful. A scene that comes to mind is outside of a store. It is night and you can see the moon, but all the characters have shadows that are projected on the wall. There was no street light to be seen. A character is destroyed at one point, but manages to reappear later after retiring from a publication. Come on!!! It felt like I was watching a high school play. I kept waiting for the characters to greet the members of their family with the camera and mouth "hello mom." I can only give you two positive comments ... it ended and it was good to laugh. Please, do not rent this movie!
