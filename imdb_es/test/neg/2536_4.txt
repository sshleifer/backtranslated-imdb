Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon begin in Switzerland when the world's leading detective, Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), mocks the Nazis and manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) out of the country and with the relative safety of London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel has designed a revolutionary new vision of the bomb that will change the aerial bombardment forever and has agreed to give it to the British government, but those Nazis want it just as badly. The secret of the sight of the bomb and sell it to the Nazis. Add the clumsy inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey) of Scotland Yard, the love interest of Dr. Tobel, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), murderers, mysterious scientists and a coded and disconcerting message. deliver his pump sight ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 and 1946 to present Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The screenplay by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short film 'The Dancing Men' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and it is not the tradition of the mystery of Holmes' murder, since it is more a story of wartime adventures. To ignore what Holmes is about, the resolution of complex crimes and mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned and the participation of the Nazis and the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place, uncomfortable and simply do not. Do not feel very good with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like a last minute idea, as if they could not devise a villain for that and, in general, it is much less attractive than others in the series. However, at least it is brief. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual efficient work, but you have to cut back a bit on the attention that was made more than 60 years ago. It does not have a real style or imagination and lacks atmosphere and intrigue too. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine if it is not spectacular, black and white cinematography is fine, although I understand that a computer-colored version is also available. . The acting is fine, Bruce and Hoey do their usual comic turns and Rathbone's hairstyle in this ridiculous aspect and I'm glad he changed it for later payments. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were a disappointment compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little for which I can recommend it and everything that made the other so good seems missing here. Leave the latter to the last and look at some of the best ones first, just for Die Hard fans.
