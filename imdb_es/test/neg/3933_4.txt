The plot in Petites Coupures certainly left the viewer astonished. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> In the space of approximately 48 hours, the character of Auteuil has an affair with a teenager, loses the affections of his wife, the attempts to seduce Scott Thomas, is rejected by her, continues to grope for another female character in the back of a car and is finally shot by his problem. <br /> <br /> *** end of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas. Like Charlotte Rampling, it looks like a star for French cinema. My hope is that one day Fran√ßois Ozon can choose it in a part where he can show his true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent French films like Le Colonel Chabert that send for a DVD release, but this is the gut that is chosen. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
