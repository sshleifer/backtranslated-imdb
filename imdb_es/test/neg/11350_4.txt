A Chinese gang attacks and erases another gang at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. Interestingly, and for no discernible reason, the gang asks a volunteer to blame the massacre and leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. Now the fact that ONE MAN ALONE is the only responsible for approximately 50 deaths exceeds me, so sending this man only seems silly, but that's the plot. Later, when this man arrives home, betrayals and machinations have occurred, leading to almost an hour and fifteen minutes of uninterrupted murder. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts movie with a large part of a plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as it is practically a non-stop action and there is virtually no plot or character development, including compared to other martial arts movies. I would estimate that 80-90% of the film is fight scenes, endless fighting scenes and reasonably well done with knives. Again and again and again, fight the scenes! If you want a movie with a corpse count, maybe even hundreds of people as people are beaten, beaten and beaten, then this is the movie for you. The problem was that at the end of the movie, literally, there are no people to kill and the movie really lost my interest. Basically it is not, but if you want to see emotion and action ONLY, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until near the end. And, when they FINALLY do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is very, very scarce. Logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why?) Make this a kind of movie that "turns off the brain".
