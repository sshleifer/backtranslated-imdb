What distinguishes some of the films from 'Lone Star' (and many others in western movies and adventures of the thirties) was their lack of what we recognize as storytelling. To make sure they had good against evil (the basic element of any Westerner), the boy meets the girl and some common characters, like the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or granddaughter, and sometimes the evil banker or another businessman, but the way the action was developed was often different from one movie to another. <br /> <br /> 'The Lawless Frontier' presents Earl Dwire in his great star (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, a half-Apache, half-American posing as a Mexican who speaks the language with fluidity. "Her biggest presentation as a Mexican seemed to be her outrageous mariachi clothes, the only plot seems to be that she wants to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of" Old Dusty. "When she meets her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators.You would think that because the opening scene shows Zanti killing John (Wayne) Tobin's father off camera, he would have a bigger role in the movie. It makes Too much to chase back and forth between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> However, we received many good stunts from Yakima Canutt, which includes getting Ruby on his horse when he passes by, jumping on "renegades" and hit. a horse jumped from a cliff to a lake, and even he slipped through the sequence of locks that was in "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body navigation record instead of straddling a tree branch, and their inclusion is just as illogical this time too, since they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The highest point is clearly measured and methodical, well photographed, through the desert after the flight and stumbling over Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in innumerable series, westerns and "moon" sci-fi movies framed behind him. There is no final duel at fifty paces with the heroine who runs from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a well and dies. <br /> <br /> After a couple of too many chase sequences, the Zantai gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind. a rotating cabinet that apparently leads to a cannon, now blocked by having been dynamited. Do not ride towards sunset or compulsorily kiss the girl: the last shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, by phone to now Sheriff John Tobin, "How would you like to have Sheriff Tobin dine?" The film also has little lighting and editing at the beginning, the pace is slow, some parts with the sheriff make it drag and the horse chases fill the film. Then, despite the different and unusual elements, it appears as one of the weakest solitary stars.
