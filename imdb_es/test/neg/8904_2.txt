This movie has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it's not a great movie. It is rather a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically an opinion article from a newspaper put on celluloid. However, his well-researched traditional opinion article is much more convincing and concise than what is presented here. The filmmaker is trying to convey to the viewer the difficulties of African life, in particular the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank, using the configuration of a mock trial against the aforementioned. There are 10 additional minutes scattered throughout the film that make a half-story plot attempt and a strange western-style shooting scene in Hollywood, where the director seems quite pleased with his own intelligence (therefore, frequent comparisons of Godard). <br /> <br /> Of course, when the movie starts, it is never explained what and who is on trial, but as we know now, the French refuse to feed their audience. <br /> <br /> Many passionate arguments are made, but often they are long, delivered in a strident monotonous tone (one that becomes quite easy to disconnect after a while) and very unspecific. The last point is the most frustrating of all, since here a specific case is very well reasoned against the institutions prosecuted. Unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are evil oppressors and must forgive third world debt. We are given only the occasional hint of the specific reasons why the organizations prosecuted are guilty, but never a clear case. The test plots and images from the surrounding village shed light on the suffering of these African residents, but one wonders why we should sit for 2 hours, when a much more accurate picture could be painted in a 20-minute Newsweek article. , or the episode of Bill Moyers. In the end, there is something very important to say about this topic, it just does not appear very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious and forgiving piece.
