Why???? What a disgusting joke about a supposed movie ... the poster looked like a nice movie ... what a disappointment ... who the hell is the male protagonist? He looks like an old retired policeman. I am a policeman and I can say ... the man can not act ... to be a policeman again ... without a presence on the screen ... why did they show their naked ass, like Mel Gibson, no hell. .. put the filmmaker out of business ... this guy has nothing to do with making a movie ... I seriously doubt that women or gay men find him attractive ... whoever he has chosen The movie is a trick without talent that did not throw any talent trick to the head. It's great that we whites always get Asian women, but why an ugly white man why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as the white boyfriend? Do Asian women like ugly white boys or blacks in what I see? Do not understand ... it must be a low self-esteem ... <br /> <br /> The only hot girl that can act in the movie was Kate Holliday ... why was there a hot white girl among all the the rest? the ugly Asian girls who think they are hot and who can act ??? <br /> <br /> Only two actors in this film, the Poetry Host at the end of the film and the only hot white girl in the massage house .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the protagonists of the movie .. <br /> <br /> The Asian character was ridiculous, it seemed like he was trying too hard to be a kind of sexy ghetto / black girl ... The key word here is "try" ... <br /> <br /> Gina ... you can not act and you are not physically strong enough for this kind of role ... you need to play character roles and be more humble Your own presentation ... <br /> <br / > I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I looked for her in IMDb and she is a great Asian actress. If that's the case, I do not want to see what the bad Asian-American actresses are ... <br /> <br />. It's no wonder that Hollywood does not have Asian American actors! If this is the best they got !!! They were supposedly winning some kind of Asian film award? Give me a break ... it seemed like they just made a movie just for the sake of putting a lot of Asian girls in them ... they're not even hot ... Gina ... you're not hot ... stop trying. .. play character roles and improve your acting ... you're not a prominent female type ... <br /> <br /> If these movies make pigs fly ... I'm sorry for being so forceful but I feel that these actors / actresses need to improve or work in their trade: except for the two actors that I mentioned that the protagonists should have played ... I say this in love with all the leading Asian girls in the film, please do what they say your parents and go and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and act for fun. I hope that is what you are doing now. I'm not trying to be bad, but I hope this is read and I push people to either. improve or go to another business ... there was not even an ethical message in this film ... <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if "Soap Girls" were secretly financed by members of Ku Klux Kl a special department of hate propaganda from Asian Americans of the Klan <br /> <br /> .. Otherwise, Asians must hate themselves ... seeing this movie, it makes me look like the grateful viewer that I am not Asian ... you are pathetic. .Along self-esteem the Asians.
