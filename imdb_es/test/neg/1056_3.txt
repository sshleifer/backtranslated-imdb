I regret not agreeing with you, but I thought that the DKC series is quite attractive. So much so that I have invested in the SNES system and in my own copies of the games. This is, of course, almost ten years after the initial launch of DKC 1. The graphics were innovative for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and the characters are memorable, and the games brought me and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. It is true that the second game was better than the first, and the third perhaps lacked the "edge" of the second installment. But all three offered different games, and I enjoy them to this day. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were NO video games at all (and the TVs were black and white!).
