This was the worst movie that my wife and I have seen. The only concessions are that we do not pay to see them in the movies, since we rent them in DVD in the video store. Simply - There's no argument worth mentioning (I only saw it 5 minutes ago and I've already forgotten it), annoying characters misunderstood by two-bit actors and if this was a comedy, I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh that came out of the movie was that we joked with each other and agreed that it was really horrible. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was absolutely pathetic and I warn others not to waste their time. A farce of the name National Lampoon, Rating 0/10.
