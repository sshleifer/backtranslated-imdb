The audience sat quietly throughout most of the movie, with only a few rare and occasional giggles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent that I felt lashes. When it's convenient for the plot, Smart behaves like a master spy. At other times, he acts like an imbecile. They raise many classic lines from the television series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "I lost it for a long time" is fun if someone speaks it with a braggadocio attempt that is an obvious failure, but loses all humor when someone qualified speaks it. To a slightly lesser degree, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace, from experts to cartoony. Siegfried, the main villain, seems to be intelligent, but makes decisions that do not make any sense. However, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess. I am completely depressed that so many IMDb users think that this was good.
