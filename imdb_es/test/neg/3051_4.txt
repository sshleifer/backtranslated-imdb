One of Stan Laurel's many silent comedies before joining Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is a hokum ho-hum. The story is very disjointed, although this could be due to today's edition, and humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential arguments are initiated and ignored; for example, Stan's promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what she has done to him never comes to fruition. Stan's character does not seem to be very focused either, but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed Laurel & Hardy's 'Stanley' fame, so he might be hoping to see this flaw. <br /> <br /> I firmly believe that all silent films should be preserved and seen, and I am glad that this is available. It's just not a great movie.
