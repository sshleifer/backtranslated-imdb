This thing, which should not be called a movie, is almost worse than "Hands", but you just have to see that it's hilarious. If you see it in the video store, keep it, if you see the tenth anniversary edition, yes, there is a special edition, for less than $ 10, buy it, if your friend borrows it, you just have to see it. The acting is so bad, and the blood is so false. After seeing this, you will wonder why they made this insult to the art of cinema. That's assuming your face does not melt like the Nazis in "Raiders." If you can see this, be sure to rate this movie as 1 (awful) so you can get to the last 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1, right now.
