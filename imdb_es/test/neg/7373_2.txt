This is the main problem of this film, along with a large number of the biggest Québec films: pretentiously made by pretentious people. <br /> <br /> It's really sad, but the "big shot" filmmakers (driving Dodge Stratus ...) from this province think they got the truth, they know how little people like it. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a great movie like this one (30 million? !!?) is made, it is cutting off many others who will not see their film made for lack of government help. This generates mediocrity; only "family friends" films will be made. <br /> <br /> I look angry and I am. I went to see Nouvelle-France waiting for a trip in the life of my ancestors, but I found myself caught in a series of inconsistencies: French accent (we have to please our cousins, so f *** our language of québec) and lack of history. The investigation is only a few. Add again and again the love story and the same musical score and the spectator of québecois will open up and ask for more. I'm glad that this pretentious piece of shit will not work as planned by Dodge Stratus Big Shots ... It will help filmmakers who are not in the "film business" of Quebec. <Br /> <br /> Instead, rent Cruising Bar and have a really good time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive you for ruining such an incredible title.
