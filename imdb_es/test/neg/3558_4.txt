A 1930 atmosphere, very well evoked, provides much interest for a viewer at the beginning of the 21st century; unfortunately, "London Belongs to Me" has little more to recommend, besides the charms of English charm. All the problems rest on the deeply unfocused story. The main plot has to do with the actions of the young Richard Attenborough, the problems in which he finds himself and how the community in which he lives unites to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main problem here is that the character of Attenborough takes everything on himself and, frankly, is guilty of almost all the accusations against him, so it is disconcerting that the film (and all the characters) have so much sympathy for him . He is treated as a victim of circumstances when in reality he is not; and what is more, he does not show that he has much remorse for his actions, he only worries about getting away with things he did not intend to do. Alastair Sim has a lot of screen time in a secondary plot that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot's main line and you wonder what he's doing there (although Sim is, as always, excellent). You know there is a problem with the structure when the main plot hits constantly against the secondary plot, but not the other way around. And, following a quiet pace and careful construction, the plot completely collapses in the last 20 minutes with a profoundly unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that does not even show us if Attenborough's character has developed at all from the previous procedures . The film does not end, it simply stops. <br /> <br /> The acting, the direction and the general feeling of the film can be praised, but unfortunately the history and the structure of the pieces of the piece constantly. A final point of curiosity: Alec Guinness based his performance on the film "The Ladykillers", far superior, in the performance of Alastair Sim in this film, to the two characters who have the first scenes almost identical.
