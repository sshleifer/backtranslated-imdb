The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a girl who faces abuse (both emotional and physical) and tries to cope with it and survive. What makes the film fall apart is the terrible use of voice-overs and cheesy dialogue. The actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. In addition, there is an excessive use of metaphors very tedious, almost funny in the voiceover. The highlight is the girl's performance. Nice try, but this is a bad smell.
