"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've seen! Not only support is weak, but also the characters. I'm sorry to say to you, Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest Vampire I've ever seen in my life. Sorry Edison. Your role in this movie was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this movie and I am sure that if they did not have Kazaf in the film, the plot would not be very different. The main plot of the film is not explained enough and the whole film focused too much on the growing relationship of Helen and Kazaf. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, he is the prince, right? And that? <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were just stupid. Yes, the action was great, but the whole scheme was stupid. In a scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes, it seems that now he is fully developed. Why would you wait until it has grown to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures who followed them persistently. How can you be so naive as not to know they're vampires? People die around them with bite marks on their necks; Surely the NEWS will be published faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What kind of girl would not be afraid of vampires, especially if your brother's job is to kill them? I can bet you would not find a girl as brave as Helen if you searched in your entire life. Helen is annoying, malicious, and is a drama queen in the movie. She tries too much to be different and in the end she fails miserably. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've seen in any movie. Why would you bite someone's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that his reaction to Kazaf's confession does not discourage him. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in the story. How degrading for a young actor like himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. He does not defend himself throughout the film and does not fight. Even though I'm a Edison fan, I would not want a man who lies on the floor all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters from the movie. His love is pure and sweet. The gypsy is beautiful and does not try too hard like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the film. A failure of the plot was the death of Reeve. The film had absolutely no substance, but it condemned itself by eliminating one of the only nice characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story did not focus much on him and, therefore, made his desire to get the "rock" of Kazaf seem irrelevant. <br /> <br /> It's very sad because towards the end of the movie, I was being forced to look because I desperately wanted to see Kazaf fight. The ending was so abrupt because all the time I expected it to happen so well. Kazaf, who is supposed to be the Vampire Prince, does not do anything for the film and I'm sure that if they took it out, the film would not be very different. I recommend you NOT waste your time in this movie like I did. I was very disappointed. If you're looking for a great movie, why not watch "The Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean"? Sympathetic characters with a well written plot.
