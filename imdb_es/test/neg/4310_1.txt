It's true that you can put an airplane model against a black background and call it science fiction, and that's enough to interest me, so if you're like that, Black Horizon will at least interest you before you see it. The best part of the film is when they review some real images of the launch of a ferry. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like the Naked Gun series, simulating police dramas with bad clich√©s and bad performances. Unfortunately, I do not think they pretend to be funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so you just have to laugh at them, and not with them. <br /> <br /> In As a side note, it is rare to see a film that takes place half in outer space, half on earth and does not mix with the expected extraterrestrial and supernatural events. It really hurts a more realistic drama based on our space efforts.
