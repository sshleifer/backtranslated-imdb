When I saw in the voting panel that some people had given this movie a score of 10, I assumed they did not know that the score was not 100. This is a disaster movie in the real sense of that term. Written poorly and weakly directed with the so-called actors unable to act, but able to make a face when ordered. During the first 60 minutes the story seems to go in one direction, then it changes course and gets involved in a power struggle, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to find an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to defeat the villain with superpowers, the "writer" deceives. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called plot because it was easier than achieving an acceptable outcome. It is not that the writing would even know the word "outcome". Some movies go directly to the DVD. This one should have gone directly to the dumpster.
