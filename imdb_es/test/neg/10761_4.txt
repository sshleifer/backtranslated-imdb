It hits me how someone can rate this movie very well. It is not an understatement to call it exaggerated. How the man managed in such a short time to build a labyrinth of underground wooden rooms is pretty ridiculous or maybe he was the best carpenter since Jesus. The obese Sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from Jerry Springer's show and I found the blonde woman leader Jennifer Jason Leigh pretty simple. We have an expression here in the United Kingdom 'lamb made lamb' that fits perfectly into it. However, it was not all bad, I enjoyed it immensely when the final credits were shot and 'The End' arose. It was quite brilliant for this television movie that, had it been a cinematic premiere, would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all.
