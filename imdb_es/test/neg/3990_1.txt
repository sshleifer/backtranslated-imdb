Once again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The commercialization of this film was deeply in disagreement with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis of this film, I expected to see a town full of grotesques, each one of the men of blood injected with blood and swollen with alcohol, splashed with heroin needles and bent with chronic masturbation; In such a "den of vice" would come the clean-shaven hero, Gabriel shining. Instead, the film was the opposite of what was expected of me. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a small place full of poor people who do the best they can, whether it's playing a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the pain or watch cockfights (chickens, not penises) to ward off boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate?) Grotesque in the piece was Gabriel, the Presbyterian preacher with brainwashing played by Macfadyen, whose face is constructed in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of baffled fury. If he were kind, I would suggest that the dismissals of Paisley's preacher were an ingenious remark designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is such an inept filmmaker that he quickly despises everyone in the film, letting the public worry about the more than eighty minutes of dark and trite tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a "guess the accent" game interrupted with "detect location" rounds. Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother's son and suffocating his father? Of course, no; He is a preacher who criticizes the bible and therefore is psychotic. All the inhabitants of the city stare, surprised, at the end of the film, but I suspect that they have realized what turkey they have put their names to. <br /> <br /> The Film and Television Commission of Northern Ireland has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only thing I can say in favor of this movie is that it has managed to replace "Superman Returns" as the worst movie of 2006; a hell of an achievement. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
