A special unit of four police detectives gives justice in a unique way in Los Angeles in the 1950s. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's chief officer and his teammates are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. They are also starring Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately, that's the only remotely impressive thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when the young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, appears dead in a remote area of ​​the city currently under development. We call our gang of four detectives and it is immediately obvious that Max Hoover of Nolte is going to have a very personal interest in this case. We will soon discover that Allison, in addition to knowing Hoover quite well, was also involved with some very important military and governmental types who may have had reasons to want him to die. But who was involved exactly and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman to die? Hoover and the crew set out to find out. It sounds like an interesting premise, but unfortunately it's not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive variety of names, the performance here leaves a lot to be desired. Nolte is overreacting, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come out as cartoons, Penn has almost nothing to do and Griffith is as bored as he can be. By far, the best performance is Connelly in all the flashback sequences too fleeting. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The sense of drama that would be expected from a mystery of this kind is completely missing. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, nothing seems to happen in most of the image. Instead, we simply crawl into a pretty ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is resolved, you may find yourself saying, "Oh, come on, is that all there is?" But it gets worse as the mystery is solved, we get a completely ridiculous and absolutely incredible action sequence. And even then we are forced to suffer more when another horrible scene is approached, badly acted, completely unnecessary in the end. And then, fortunately, it's over. And not a moment too soon.
