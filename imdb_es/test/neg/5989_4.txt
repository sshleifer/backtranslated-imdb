The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream and I know what you did last summer, this film knows the conventions of this type of horror movies and manages to create some good lines and scenes that are reproduced in those conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is simply bored. The plot is the base of your ten little Indians who communicate with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will be beaten until only the hero (ine) remains to defeat evil. And this is exactly what happens. Absolutely without surprises and without tension. The values ​​of production and acting were fine, but I had no motivation to see it to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the final scene would unfold. The ending surprised me a little, because it managed to fade, literally, instead of throwing a bucket of special effects. Maybe the special effects budget had been spent to the end.
