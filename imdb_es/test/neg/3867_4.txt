Well ... there were some excellent and creamy facial shots of Marlene, along with her "shocking" gender outfit (in addition to her "transmogrification" that should not be lost from ape to human); but, in general, the usually unconvincing plot and dated performance, not to mention the less attractive melodies that come from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice, did little to ensure that Blonde Venus was a permanent place in the Pantheon of Memorable Films of my mind. Cary Grant, still in the process of childhood film, seemed to be always looking to "find himself", while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything, BUT Herbert Marshall, from the day he was born until the day he died. Naturally, from a historical point of view, it was fun to observe the blonde Venus, as long as one could set aside ... "great expectations".
