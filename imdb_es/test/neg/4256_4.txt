The year of production says it all. The film is a marauding mess of politically correct left-wing feminist nonsense of a symbolic variety of heavy handedness that is ridiculous nowadays. Each scene has the purpose of throwing light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of women in the labor community, the role of women against men, women as sexual objects, consumerism, politics, the war, etc. commented on by the internal dialogue of one of the leading actresses, or turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscences of any plot, or who the main characters really were. It is the kind of film in which consumerism mocks when a couple makes love in the shop window of a furniture store while the sales agent makes his speech, or when a revealing interview with a theatrical actress becomes an act of full striptease, by "of" Of course, "the press offensive knights are equal to those of a club audience." Then we move quickly, since we need to see the war break in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple public speeches Feminist and inflamed that drown in the (male) blast of car horns or riots, and of course we need to watch movies Stalin's newscasts and all the other usual suspects You have the idea But all this does not matter at all. is a piece without equal for any amateur (male) of Ingmar Bergman.A film in which he boasts takes Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom to the height of its beauty, which makes this critic surrender completely and simply die. and he also delights to see them use their acting skills so generously in a movie he has never heard of before. It's hard to believe that, especially, Bibi Andersson's face possesses the screen every time it appears. The cinematography is magnificently orchestrated, often delights in a dimensionless whiteness (?) Overexposed, and you never get tired of seeing the artists. How absurd, that a film made with such consideration by the feminist agenda, advocating tirelessly so that women are not seen simply as an object of desire, has nothing better to offer to the spectator of the 21st century than a parade of amazingly beautiful babies. As mentioned, I'm not complaining. I could see him again tomorrow.
