National Lampoon Christmas Break 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. The shameful failure of the live-to-video has its cousin Eddie and his family on a paid vacation with spending in the South Pacific by their boss, hoping the fool will not sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey ! The idiotic split can not be compared to any of the Vacation movies (including European Vacation!), With the question of whether the filmmakers thought the script was really fun or not. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can make it observable remotely. 83 min., Not rated. *
