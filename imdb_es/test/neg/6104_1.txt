The movie starts with a scene that simply could not be. A man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begins his morning prayers in his room while his wife sleeps peacefully. The blessings of the morning are recited, but only those that Gitai finds controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. Then, while in the filaments and in a tallis, he kisses his wife good morning! This is not an accurate description of Jewish prayer in any home, let alone in a Hasidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying Hasidic life. He is interested in adding to his growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The scenes of mikka (ritual bath) are far from accurate and their Jewish wedding was ridiculous, as it does not even come close to the atmosphere of a Chassidic wedding. I have many problems with the Hasidic lifestyle, but I have no use for Amos Gittai's comment on these issues. It would make you think that Chassidim are all dense comformists with severe episodes of depression. I may not agree with the Hasidic lifestyle, but I recognize that Chassidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own pseudo-intellectual secularist stubbornness and, therefore, is unable to portray an accurate description of Hasidic life. Apart from his poor research and the unbalanced description of Hasidic life, Gitai also fails in other ways. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue full of silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the performance, although sometimes powerful, was too often loaded with melodrama. The film continues over and over again and the ending is not worth staying around. Look if you should, but be careful. If you want to learn about the Hasidic life, go to the communities and talk to Chassidim. Do not trust the Gittai movie!
