The revisionist history, which turns the evil Marquis de Sade into a semi-heroic romantic, is hallucinatory enough. But the atrocious performance, the amateur cinematography and the terrible dubbing make this film terribly bad. The only reason to keep seeing is that almost all the women in the movie are beautiful. And, surprisingly, being tortured for days, with his hands tied high, apparently does not detract from the beauty, hairstyle and makeup of a woman. My guess is that the producers filmed mainly in Russia, choosing women for their appearance, and their willingness to work at low cost, instead of acting as actors. If you decide to see this because you have nothing better to do, or you are a film student looking for bad examples, go through all the scenes that do not involve nudity.
