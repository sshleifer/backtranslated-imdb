I can not believe there are people who voted 10 for this garbage! Has any of you accessed a computer in the madhouse where it is undoubtedly kept, or is there a special colony where especially cruel people are secretly imprisoned of which I do not know? <br /> <br /> If I was To say what I really thought about this movie, none of that would be published. <br /> <br /> For starters, his 'star' is a talentless idiot who acts like a bad Jim Carrey imitator who has already run away enough. Angel shakes his nose to resurface the Sahara desert. His name will be a total guarantee that I will not see a future movie with him in it, even if he touches a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> As for the 'plot'. One more crime that we can attribute to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they can be considered a fair game as 'bad guys' in guts like this one; the simple criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in an instant. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this film: give up making movies and, if not, trust in advertising, where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration. <br /> <br /> Finally, a criticism of IMDB: Why do not you have the facility to vote 'Zero' for a movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this gut would have to vote double zero, or something like that.
