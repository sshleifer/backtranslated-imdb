Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actress. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer long shots of Huppert's face, and it's a pleasure to see them. Huppert is not an animated actress; register the emotion with the slightest lift of an eyebrow or a smile. <br /> <br /> Besides the pleasure of seeing an experienced actor stand out in his profession, there is nothing in him. This movie that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, sadomasochism and weird behavior, "La Pianiste" could work for you.) Apart from these attributes, I could not find any redeeming value in it.) <br /> <br /> Buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth. People who compete at the highest level (musically, athletically, whatever) start out as strangers, and become strangers because of the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> It's not worth a trip to a cinema to relearn this life lesson <br /> <br />
