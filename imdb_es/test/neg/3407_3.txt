I love seeing a good giallo gory. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. It is long. Very long. The story is in bad taste and makes little sense, even if it is very obvious. The script devotes so much time to the murders and the girls, but it almost does not devote time to the murderer. This leaves a big hole in the story: we could see a group of young women bathing together, but we do not have a description of why the killer decided to kill those girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we're still in the dark when, why did the murderer [bored] decide it was worth going through the effort of firing those bad girls? It's so ingenious that I could not get in a bit. <br /> <br /> Regarding the appearance of the movie, again, boring. Nothing memorable about it. Actors? Boring. The script? Laughably boring. The whole "torrid" love story between the teacher, the blond and the student was really embarrassing. On what planet do they live? Music? Boring. Skip it.
