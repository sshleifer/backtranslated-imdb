A tedious mix of puerile efforts for humor with a romantic relationship with melodrama does not give this faintly made movie a taste of reality. When the action begins, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment, there he discovers his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who tells Reno "Well, at least it is with someone he knows", which results in Reno's decision to never have another roommate, this decision was communicated to the viewers by means of an abandoned voice-over. The plot continues after ten months in which we find that Reno complies with his word to avoid roommates, although this seems to be a question that is due to the question of his lover of those who live, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom has matrimonial plans generated. The plot moves briefly to a lazy Hollywood strip club, where Uncle Charley of Reno, in love with a "dancer" whom he finds eminently desirable, despairs at the club bar after seeing the unadorned charms he shows the object of their affections. It is evident that Charley had been aware of the defective condition of his heart, because he created a videotape during which his comment bequeathed his large residence (and mortgaged) in Hollywood to Reno, and we see that the latter decides, contrary to his vote , interviewing applicants for two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following an inane sequence that involves strange tenant candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly do not surprise them to live with them in their home, they, unknown to each other, each one selects a tenant of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly calm towards the choice of his partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) seem to have an unclear point of view for their existence other than a highly auditory fornication with a wide range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy marks the harmonious relationship of Reno and Holly . Reno is determined to patent and market a type of sports travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial venture is of great financial importance if he intends to advance his marital plan. Unfortunately, the predatory team of Chad and Nicole, whose action is supposedly tied to lust, is likely to interrupt any future intention of Reno's wedding. The direction is loose, clearly far from satisfying the basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides a scarce material with which actors can work, and improvisation becomes embarrassingly flat. As a result, the interpretations are not distinguished, they are not helped by an irregular edition, while the way of working of the camera changes as abruptly as the light of the tail of a firefly. Filmed on a low budget and at the location, only a minimum of skill is required for the design processes, but a greater measure of value could have been placed on the unpleasant D.J. Background soundtrack, usually at full volume and almost always invasive. Much of the discussion has been stimulated by the final sequences of the film that apparently are not expected by a viewer based on what has happened before, but in reality these probably comprise the only reflective parts of a poorly improvised script, and the Offers are fair for almost observable work, despite the poor quality of production as a whole.
