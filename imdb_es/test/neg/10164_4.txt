Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at the Half Way House at just the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a large number of corpses inside, including a man who was supposed to send a message: Ed Rogers. Owner of the establishment. He is observed by the niece of the dead man Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where he remained unseen during the butchery. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, in which action moves rapidly from one place to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and seems pretty innovative in the Lone Star Westerns era of this 1930's. <br /> <br /> Pre-Gabby George Hayes is at hand, without whiskers, and this is the first time that I see like a villain. In fact, he took some scenes to realize that he was in a double role, first as the hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", who communicated through pencil and paper, and became Marvin Black, leader of a band of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the murders in Half Way House, in an attempt to force Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Another basic player is also here, Yakima Canutt as a black henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima played a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne scent, "Neath the Arizona Skies." <br /> <br /> There is a good amount of time in riding between the gang of Black and Sheriff Posse, as the character of John Wayne maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, save the day by securing the thirty thousand dollars of Sally Rogers, at the expense of destroying the House of the media, where he exchanges some dynamite cartridges for the booty in a safe. The greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six shooters, and the explosion is an appropriate ending for the villain. In his best attitude of "Aw shucks", John Wayne falls under the spell of the beautiful Sally Rogers, and, unfortunately, Randy does not travel alone!
