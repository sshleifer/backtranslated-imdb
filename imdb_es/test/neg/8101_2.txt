I probably have to blame myself, but I'm sure I expected more from a movie that bears the title of "Black Dragons" and revolves around secret conspiracies of World War II, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This movie is a boring failure with an incomprehensible structure. The real plot (which is basically quite ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explanation near the end, but the problem is that you stop worrying much earlier. We see how the horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed just before World War II and ?? Especially after witnessing the end? Surely it is a premise with a lot of potential, so it is a pity that it is not elaborated better. However, there is a great dialogue that I can not resist sharing! Man towards woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can beat you? It's the only way to leave this place!" It is the only highlight in a generally boring movie. Bela Lugosi is charming ?? as usual ?? but his ghostly performance alone is not worth buying this movie. If you're interested in seeing other scary performances of theirs (in movies with decent scripts), check out "Invisible Ghost," "The Corpse Vanishes," "White Zombie," and, of course, the Dracula version of 1931.
