I hate that people in the movies go back to the screen. It is one of the main reasons why I limit myself to DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I would have had to get up and SCREAM "HE IS NOT DEAD HERE, MORON!" <br /> <br /> The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature Mr.Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to an audience is this. Let's say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a weapon. It's holding you for most of the movie. You turn the tables around and begin to strangle him. Whatever you do, keep strangling him until he is DEAD! Do not strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with that! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too soon, walks away and forgets Mr. Kidnapper until ... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it over our hero again. At this point I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him too.
