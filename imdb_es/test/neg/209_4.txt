Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have joined together for a much smarter effort, because this slips into Category B and could have been done with unnamed actors and a much smaller budget, since anyway, 2 armored trucks and a waste The warehouse could not have leaked too much. Since the writers could not come up with an intelligent stealing plan, they focused on the dramatic nature of the situation, but there was not much to exploit there either. Fishbourne and Reno do not contribute anything to this movie, except for the interest of the media, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is fine, but this was a walk in the park. The options of the main character, Ty Hackett, are quite uninspired and the final, with the "reward" is quite childish. Loss of time, money, actors and so on.
