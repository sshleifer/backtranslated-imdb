"I guess you're here for damage to your mental circuits." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson made me see this ... he mentioned it in his book "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself: "Why would Mike Nelson make me wrong?" Now I know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure that anyone who has worked on this movie is probably allied with old Slewfoot, or now it's cursed, from the CEO to the guy who drove the catering truck out of the studio. Do not look ... for God's sake ... do not look! Not even making a copy and showing someone else is going to curse you ... I'm damned now, I understand this. I accept this. But save yourself ...
