A study in bad. Bad direction, bad acting, bad writing and f / x that will teach you that it is better to update your computer before filming. It's the kind of movie you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with dad's camera when you were young at heart. But YOU certainly would not show it in public when you're sober again, right? YOU would not even see it. Avoid at all costs.
