The reason why this movie sucks, have these people read a bible? Everything in the movie was about Moses, God stood on the sidelines. That did not happen! God directed everything, told them where to go and what to do. Also people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived in Canan and betrayed God again! They did not roam for 40 years and then suddenly they found it, it was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the movie would actually take a Bible first, they would say "oh, no". Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like an imbecile who was playing with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was with them all the time and he wanted people to see that he was taking care of them. How dare they say otherwise, not even close to the passage. And Moses was kept out because he was angry with people and blatantly disobeyed God! He sinned badly and was told that he would not be allowed to enter because of that. When did Moses escape and shout to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Actually, read your story before inventing what you think is a good idea. Also, all of this God stayed away for the most part and had them do it themselves, it's not true !!! God did everything for the people, he provided them in every way and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. Everything we have to do ourselves is true somehow, but then it is not how it worked. Yes, today he does not work directly for everyone to see him, but at that time he actually killed people after the golden calf! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible next time Echo Bridge or do not make another Bible movie!
