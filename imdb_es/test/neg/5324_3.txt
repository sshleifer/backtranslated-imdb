In fact, I saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the film I was disgusted because I was wondering why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie. The film was confusing and had no flow at all, was choppy and made me want to throw a stone to the TV. I could not connect with the characters, so I did not care what happened to them (I usually love the characters because I can relate to their personality or their problems). Then I read the book and I loved it. I often read the book again, and the film is gathering dust. I would like someone to make a Koontz movie that would follow the plot of their books, then the movies would not stink so much. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU NEED TO AWAKEN MONEY!
