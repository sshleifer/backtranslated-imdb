After a meteor lands in "Boston" (actually somewhere on the Isle of Man), a hideous, fangled alien monster is released from a local girl's school, causing chaos and turning the students in creatures like zombies. This movie is apparently a loose (and stressful) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it presents the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to credit the 1986 version, you could see it. This is not start with all the problems: the performance, especially the main teacher, was very, very bad. This movie is supposed to take place in Boston (we know this because the filmmakers had the clever idea of ​​putting "Boston police" or "Boston gas company" on everything), but they all seem to have rather confusing British accents (at least I did not try to use Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big faulty mess. The best example of how silly writing is is when it is established that you can convert the student zombies back into humans by removing a necklace that contains a piece of the meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, they run around throwing zombies-students in their place. Beautiful. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the weak 1995 horror film "Grim", clearly does not know how to control his films. The movie is terribly boring in some places. The lighting is horrible. The movie looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of remarkable blood. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature coming out of a dark corner and dragging someone, while we hear that they are "horrified" screaming in the distance. This convention never worked well in the past, and it certainly does not work here. The visual effects were impressive. The opening sequence of CG in space seemed to have been created in Microsoft Slideshow for the love of God! The "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was just as horrible. Okay, I consider myself a fair criticism, so I'll give credit to who corresponds: the effects of the creatures were really great. I love the close-ups of slobbering and slobbery teeth! <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, "Breeders" is a terrible and cheap horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
