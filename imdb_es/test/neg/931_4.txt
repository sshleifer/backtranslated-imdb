First it was Zu Warriors by Tsui Hark (2001), which is visually innovative, but missing from the acting and writing departments, now this film, which is visually almost as good as Zu (although it is no longer innovative), but it is still worse in the departments of acting and writing. It's really sad that there seems to be an almost total lack of acting and writing talents in the HK film industry. I suppose you need to understand the Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues in the film really are. It's like some delinquent kids talking on the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, actors and actresses look like delinquent children and can not act even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy directed at the younger generation in HK, but have the young people of HK really become so cerebral that they can not appreciate anything other than youthful and vulgar acting / writing? If that is the case, I am ashamed to be from HK. <br /> <br /> I would like the HK filmmakers to learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a film that is visually stunning, as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments . And stop using young singers / idols / heartbreakers as actors because they can not act like many of the fans that they can have in HK!
