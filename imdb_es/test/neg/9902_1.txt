I can not believe that I spent almost three hours of my life watching this. This must be one of the most incredible, predictable and cheesy television movies I have seen in a long time. I expected some good special effects and action, instead, I spent all my time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH, GO !!!" to the screen. The dialogue is superficial and obvious, the performance is sometimes contracted and as the story progresses, is not it simply funny how EVERYTHING happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending ... Now I have seen more than my part of disaster movies, I'm actually a big fan, and I think they can often achieve completely unrealistic things as long as they are done in a fun way, but it's definitely not that. This is just an insult to smart viewers around the world. What were you thinking when they made this movie?
