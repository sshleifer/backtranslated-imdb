I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but this movie seemed long, boring and free. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most pleasant character (the only time I liked was in "The life of an insect"!) It says a lot. The character of Rene Russo was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotyped. To say that he was two-dimensional can be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help to make it real.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (involving the museum caper and NOT to Rene Russo), this movie made me want Estaban at home watching televised golf.
