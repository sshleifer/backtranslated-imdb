This movie was Flippin Awful ... I wanted to recover those hours of my life. For the love of God, stay away from this horrible crumb movie at all costs. It is not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings of this movie are quite generous for a movie of vomit like this. And where do I start? The fools A ** children in the movie ... The plot or zero story? ... The scenes of garden of varieties / frat boy-esquire of palms on the towels? Or the VERY badly acted, the adolescent insinuation angst? $$$ # @% @! My God, it NEVER ended! ..... I remember that I thought I would have preferred to kiss the cinema and then sit through this again. <br /> <br /> But what are you waiting for? Most people with the mental capacity to seek comment, will not be the target audience here at all, so SEE Pirites 2 again, or Jet Lee, if it is about oneself. Look, this movie will cost you only your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. Listen to the warning.
