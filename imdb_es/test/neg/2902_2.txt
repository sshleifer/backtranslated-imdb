... and child is the deafening collision. The spirit of a recently deceased ninja is taken over by a lineman, she undresses even the intimate clothes, pours tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it, perform a seductive dance and then he will kill the policemen he killed to the ninja that is possessed by. Only to be hunted by a ninja one-eyed master. As in real life, huh? Encouraged only by Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his refusal to put his obnoxious children in this), you really have to see this to believe it. It is the definitive mixture of genres totally in disagreement.
