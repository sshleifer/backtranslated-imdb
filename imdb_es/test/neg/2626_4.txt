"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the Japanese World War II prisoner of war camp of that name. The short story between past events and the present, when veteran elders plan a meeting. This is a very publicized and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget ran out ($ 6.5 million Australian dollars); historians and veterans criticized its authenticity; and critics criticized the uncomfortable mix of comedy and drama ("Pearl Harbor" tones). The writer of the series John Doyle (half of the successful comedy team of Roy & H.G.), has tried to defend himself with comments about "the characters are composed of real people"; "The troops used the comedy to face the situation"; "It's only based on real events"; "One of our actors was really there", etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many fantastic fictional and factual dramas have come from the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Paradise Road", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Jath" and "A Town Like Alicia". The black comedy has often been used successfully in the dramas of P.O.W: "Life is Beautiful", "The Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "The Colditz Story" and even "Hogan's Heroes". So, why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - The performance in "Changi" is uniformly excellent, music and cinematography are good. It is the writing and the direction that have disappointed him. Each scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the scorching sun, I thought: "Did not I see Alec Guinness do this in" Bridge over the River Kwai "?" Sudden flashes of surreal song and dance brought Dennis Potter's "Singing Detective", but without the finesse. This loan happened so often that it smelled like lazy writing when cutting and pasting, instead of homage. The constant interconnection between past and present stories prevented me from concentrating on any of them. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool; here I moved away from the characters, where intensity was required. The "business" is exaggerated: all conversations seemed to include "the stone of the bloody crows" and that's what it said "I understand the point, I know they are Australians". Cultural stereotypes also extended to the British and Japanese, like a young Japanese officer; British officer tense; Japanese commander wiser; Fun lovers, Australian rogues, etc. I thought I was watching "Hogan's heroes on the river Kwai." After 3 episodes I'm disconnecting.
