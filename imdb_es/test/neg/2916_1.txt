Possible alert of Spoiler, although there is not much that to spoil on this film. I saw Project A, part II, which had not seen the first movie. I do not think I've missed much. Project A Part Two is not only the worst Jackie Chan movie I've seen to date (yes, worse than 'Fantasy Mission Force'), this movie is one of the most incredible movies the world has ever seen. It falls short of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' on the sleep induction scale. The plot twists and knots like a 50-foot ball of yarn with which the cat has been playing and is finally left dead. The "humor", if you could call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman, who despite how many people tell him he is not funny, is determined to get out of his bad mood no matter how painful it is. a movie. . And this movie is painfully bad. The plan involves Jackie Chan as a Navy officer recruited by the police force to gather "all known criminals." He rounds them in the first half hour of the movie, and I prayed for a quick ending that I did not get. Why the film bothers to progress from this point, I have no idea. The film is prolonged again and again without any purpose, without a plot, and the humorous attempts that fail so miserably make Carrot Top look like a comic genius. The Kung Fu in this movie is lame, and forgettable. There is better Kung Fu in that movie about the 3 Ninja children. Project A, part II, is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, but a complete waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung that have made movies a world superior to this one. While Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain death, he enters 'Blair Witch' mode by asking (and wishing) `Will he die NOW, so that the film can end? ` An example of how ridiculous this movie is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A gang of pirates (who do not look at all like pirates) throw axes at Jackie. Does Jackie take one of the rebellious axes and break the chain of handcuffs? Do not! You see that that would spoil the "hilarious" gag of him being handcuffed to someone else. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her, and notice that not even they will laugh at this movie. If you are sleepless, this movie will surely make you sleep. Do not operate heavy machinery while observing plan A, part II. Possible side effects include headache, tension in the retina and death from boredom. 0/9 stars
