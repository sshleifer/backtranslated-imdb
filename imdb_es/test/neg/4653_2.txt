All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaaa-sie!" Little Timmy, or whatever the boy's name was, moaning his little towhead toward his friend from Border Collie. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to movies (or was it the other way around? I'm clearly too lazy to investigate here), and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to make a "this movie has gone to the dogs!" word game, so I will not (although technically I did). But in a way, he has. Lassie (playing Shep, man's best friend) gets the highest turnover. THE DOG GETS TOP BILLING. Now, I'm not familiar with the way actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it develops in my mind: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, in the credits, it will be ", and with Lassie as Shep! LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr MOVIE MOGUL: Ha ha, boy, calm down, calm down! LASSIE: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo MOVIE MOGUL: Well, I think I see. LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL: Oh God! Drop my arm! Top billing! The best billing for you, now let go of my arm! <br /> <br /> So, the dog get a higher turnover, and with the rest of this cast in shock, I guess it's understandable, we get the adorable grumpy old Jonathan the seeker, his young, weeping and seemingly orphan friend Tommy, the evil loser Lin Taylor, and the adorable old man religious Grumpus Pilot Pete The flesh of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences, so you save I missed the real pain of watching the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while he is on his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin who is obsessed with gold, and Jonathan, for some reason, gives Shep the weeping wee-bitch Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees him, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy complains, it's cold, and Shep carries out an elaborate plan to get back at Lin, what he (or she?) Does. End. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a deep and disturbing need to see a Lassie movie (even then, there has to be a better Lassie movie that is), just avoid The Painted Hills. When he is not crawling, marvel at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar in style, perhaps, to Keanu Reeves, always with the same facial expression, only the body moves), setting the obvious using several minutes of film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with their white-actor-painter "Ugh! How! Me Running Bear!" stereotypes, The Painted Hills is suitable only for Lassie fetishists or people who have some sort of connection with prospecting through their days as an old canasilla seeker for that glistening gold vein.
