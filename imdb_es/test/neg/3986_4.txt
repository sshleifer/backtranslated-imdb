Poor Shirley MacLaine struggles to lend something to this sensational and uncomfortable movie, but it tramples on the sentimental feeling of a movie that is not based on reality. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Curtis Hanson? Did you have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? Hanson can make an effective drama punctuated with comedy, as shown by "Wonder Boys." So I do not know what happened to him here. This is the kind of film that does not want to accept that life is messy and delicate, and that clean and orderly ends (however implausible they may be) can be a good closing shot, but they are completely false if people see the The film has gone through something remotely similar to what the characters in the movie went through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I created a game to express the plot points before they happened, for example, "The old man will teach him to read and then he will fall dead". Bingo! This is one of those movies where the characters give small speeches that summarize their emotional problems, which makes you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are so aware of what is causing them. Toni Collette (by the way, a good actress and one of my favorites if I do not have much to work with here), gives a speech from the beginning about why she buys so many shoes and never uses them, explaining them in a flash of neon. Uncomfortable connection reason for the movie. At that moment, I knew what it was for and the movie was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
