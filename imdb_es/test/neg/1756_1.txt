The two protagonists, an Englishman and an Australian who film a history of the American Civil War in Romania, do not have the slightest spark among them, they are incredibly incredible as lovers, and they are totally unsympathetic. There is no history, characterization, practically nothing to keep the eyelids apart during this endless festival of holes. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly, practically chews the fence posts, but at least seeing her embarrassing herself provides comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a decade too old for paper and she has no idea what's going on. Jude Law's imbecile role could have been played equally by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander through the forest with a stupid appearance while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show. Not that it mattered, because all guest star roles were completely unnecessary, since they did not advance the supposed plot in an iota. And as if all that was not enough, the author felt that it was necessary to throw some kung fu jumping horses. What was that?
