"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the strange sense of behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in the unpredictable life of Clark Kent. When a poisonous flower finds its way to Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and, when it affects Jonathan, he becomes ill-tempered and violent, however, Clark manages to prevent him from erupting until his father finally faints. good. so far so good. The next one is Lana. the episode was good until that moment, since the flower makes her try to seduce Clark. at the last moment, he rejects it but the damage is already done. This episode causes erroneous impressions and is not suitable for people under twenty, due to its adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect that the flower has on Pete) was good, but the central part that was the alternative personality of Lana, was not the most challenging, and that ruined what he could have been a brilliant episode. I give this Episode two.
