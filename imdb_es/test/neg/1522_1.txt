Possibly the worst movie of the existing genre. It was advertised as a comedy, but it is simply tragically pathetic. I do not think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they specifically asked for it. It is the mood of the toilet at its poorest point, I would even avoid watching the trailer. I just went to see him because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you will be in love with this. Whoever wrote that was biased or seriously deranged. I am still baffled at how honestly such a statement can be believed. I rarely leave the cinema, it really takes a lot of effort for a movie to have that effect on me: it did it in just 30 minutes.
