This movie is about a woman in love with a friend of her boyfriend. As of that moment, he has to divide his time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. <br /> <br /> This movie feels as if it has been made on a minimal budget. The majority of the film is set in a floor with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits only make momentary appearances. The costume designer does not seem to have much to do, since the actors wear very realistic clothes and, in fact, most of the time they are naked. <br /> <br /> The film is very complicated, which should have compensated for the deficiencies described above. However, the dialogues sound too compound and clumsy. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue is a person who says a very long prayer, and then the person says "Me too". After the frenzy of agreement, the dialogue descends into a mess of salad of disconnected and confused words. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film that I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet that expresses what it is. Not only men who can be infidels. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment.
