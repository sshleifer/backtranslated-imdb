First, the first thing that came to mind after I finished this movie last night was "Why the 8MM 2 title?" Because I saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the plot of the first movie? ? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to enter the porn industry and that was not necessary in the plot, because after seeing the end that I will not spoil, it just did not make any sense. . <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his girlfriend are in Hungary and realize that a woman who swims naked in the pool area is very attractive, so when they see her in a club, they decide to have fun little bit. and have a trio of steam. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is sent photos of all of them who have the adventure, for fear that it is made public and endanger their career, they pay the man who sent the photos, the diplomat goes crazy and "kill" the man. leading to a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl with whom they had the adventure, but things get deeper and darker as they go into what they got. <br /> <br /> What could have been a good thriller, resulted in an inexplicable and not well thought-out movie, which was sad. As I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first, so do not fall into the trap. It's just a sexual thriller that does not make sense, but it's good only for those nights, because, frankly, this is one of those movies where it's so close to pornography that it could be classified as a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
