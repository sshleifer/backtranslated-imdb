What a great cast and what a pathetic film attempt. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive ... absolutely ridiculous. One of the most talented and beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse still, she supposedly dyes her hair in the middle of the movie, but it's obvious that she only wears a cheap black wig bought in a drag queen costume store. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building where the main actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is badly photographed, to boot. It looks like an overweight freshman who has cowering in too many buffets in the cafeteria of everything you can eat. I was so anxious to see this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I'd rather see Nastassja read the phone book, with her OWN hair.
