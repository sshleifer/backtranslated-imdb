Oh, well, I thought it should be a good action, but it was not. Although Jeff Speakman stars, there's nothing to see. Only two fight for almost 1.5 hours, yak. He talks a lot and everything is so artificial that you can not believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want a good action, do not rent this movie.
