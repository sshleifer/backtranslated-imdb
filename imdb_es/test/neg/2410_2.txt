I really did not know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I certainly expected it to be a little better than what I got. I knew that the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the illustration on the cover of the Subversive DVD looks beyond the genius and I can not resist. For a long time (in fact, too long), this film gave the impression of being an unofficial sequel to Porky's with frenetic, vulgar and offensive jokes. Five mega-dorks, one of them who looks like a young and exact clone of Jim Carrey, desperately want to be members of a fraternity house, but his last initiation could be a bit exaggerated and dangerous. They drop in the center of the city with provocative markings painted on their faces, simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war. It is not long before they face Splatter, a warrior apparently half man and half machine, who leads a gang that I never knew who or what they were. Was it a government experiment? Cyborgs? Imitators terminator of a distant future? Does it matter to anyone? "Future-Kill" is a strange amateur movie with a stage that passes from one subject to another without any form of logical or narrative connection. The plot takes vital elements of the great cult classics such as "The Warriors", "Escape from New York" and "The Terminator", but the end result is a gigantic science fiction monstrosity. The costumes and special effects are pretty unfortunate and there are a lot of cheap and free nudes. The acting is terrible, but I'm willing to blame the delayed dialogues instead of the cast members. One to avoid at all costs, despite a really great DVD cover. Resist it!
