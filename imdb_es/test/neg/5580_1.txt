Once in a while it's good to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent the actor Keanu Reeves is in comparison. The premise of this story is good: the teenagers go out on a boat, the meteorites fall in the water, the aliens kill the teenagers. What do I not like about that, if you like thrillers? But I should have known something was wrong when I read that it was only 75 minutes long. I thought: "I hate to judge movies for the time they spend, who says a movie has to be 90 minutes?" But once I took the DVD to BBuster's house, I was surprised by the horrible quality of the production, the acting and the direction of this completely amateur piece of junk. The only reason I saw it until the end was because I do not have cable TV and I already paid four dollars for it. However, there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is really decent, and far exceeds this dreck. First, special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the aliens: the costumes looked interesting (rubber suits), but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you can not really see them! And almost none of the actors was convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I must say that the DVD case was manufactured with much higher production standards than the film itself, which felt like a scam, so be careful when renting other DVDs. Save your $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
