Although I had previously seen it on Italian television some time ago, this time it seemed to me that it was a surprisingly tolerable potboiler, driven by an international cast of familiar faces (including a bewildered Joseph Cotten as the Baron) and, unlike many other films of the subgenre Euro-Cult, a plot full of incidents instead of lethargic rhythm. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a little seedy and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an enthusiastic scientist who still strives to create life forms from corpses (one could have thought that he would have already become an army of them and not keep fighting to perfect his technique), but Mrs. Neri looks good in and out of the garb and the reliable Herbert Fux probably stands out as a lusty robber / blackmailer .
