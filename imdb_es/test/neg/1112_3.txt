Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: an empty house next to an abandoned mine in a forest with a tragic past; The family moves home and strange things start to happen. The creepy little children begin to appear here and there doing things of small, spooky children. But that's where the cunning and potential fun ends. This group of children was sealed in the mine many decades before, and now they appear wandering through the forest (bad makeup) with weapons in search of meat to eat. Oh, I understand, this is a ghost zombie movie. Hmmm ... although I can appreciate that someone try something new with this genre, this simply did not work. What was the motivation of the children when trying to devour meat? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine that all the filmmakers gathered around the daily shots laughing because they felt it was going to be a terrific / terrifying movie? I discovered that, after thirty minutes, I felt the familiar resignation of having wasted my time in another modern crap-fest. While the acting was good and the scene / cinematography of good quality, the script itself suffered what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre. A group of children who walk through the mall is more afraid than this group of poorly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, and although I can appreciate the story, I may have even enjoyed it if I had read it. Instead of looking at it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is called Wicked Little Turd with greater precision.
