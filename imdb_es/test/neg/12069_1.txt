BLOOD FIELD <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> While walking in a forest near the Camp Blackwood desert, the site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier, four young city dwellers are attacked by a masked psychopath who kills his guide (Courtney Harris) and lurks them in the woods with murderous intent ... <br /> <br /> Loss of low rental time, filmed on a camcorder using the sequential 3D format of the Nu-View field. There is a plot, at least, but the script adheres closely to an established model (with obvious hints like "Friday the 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without adding anything remotely new or interesting to the formula. Director Brad Sykes, also responsible for similar three-dimensional efforts such as THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002), cites the early work of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as key influences in his career, but while these filmmakers challenged the mainstream with his efforts without budget, Sykes uses video technology simply to imitate his cinematic heroes, resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. Apart from the 3-D format, there is NOTHING here to justify anyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
