I really was waiting for this title. It sounded and it looked fun. The idea that someone who made a movie of corny monsters of the 50 could have been worth some laughs, but this title just bores. First of all, there is almost no Froggg in the whole movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit down for more than 75 minutes of dramatic drama and dialogue to catch a glimpse of Froggg fucking a girl with a bare chest. Why? In addition to that, the film lacks any funny plot. I mean, give me something that is a little more interesting than just a couple of people talking. I wanted to see some hot girls looking for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cute dragged to their lair in desperate need of rescue (Creature from the Black Lagoon), I wanted to see some silly action scenes the Froggg goes on a wave of murders, or maybe escaping from a silly trap. Something exciting! Geez, have fun, be creative! Who wants to sit through endless and tired scenes of dialogue in a creature film? My advice to the filmmakers: to move forward, their concepts are good, but their execution must be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most importantly ... put more creature in a movie of creatures!
