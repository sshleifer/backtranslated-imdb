This could be for those who have been in summer camps, but it sure is not an entertaining camp. I went to one before, but it did not make me scream with joy. Instead, it made my head hurt. <br /> <br /> The first thing you noticed is that Bill Murray actually had some hair in the 70s. Yes, and he did not mind running a bit. But for him to run a lot, you would need to give him a woman to pursue. <br /> <br /> It's not that some of the maneuvers can not be fun. For example, the joke that runs with one of the counselors who is always waking up in another place due to the movement of his bed. Instead, it is that jokes and acrobatics were misconfigured and executed. It just was not fun. <br /> <br /> For someone who loves comedy, this is a pain. Others are stuck to her for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it does not come close. "F"
