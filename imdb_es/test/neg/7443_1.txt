The violent sequel to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never Again, The Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, as it is almost humorless, and is extremely bad, and should have been rated NC-17 , due to scenes with babies involved in shootings, people who threaten to brutally kill very small babies with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old boy who uses a lot of explicit blasphemy, gives drugs to many people at random, shoots and shoot graphically and killing police and SWAT officers, opening fire on police officers when there are many small children and small children present, and a whole group of children who use profanity and hit the store owner (who is a man very old) from an electronics store. Stealing and destroying many items there. This movie gives a new meaning to the term "terribly bad", but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible. In general, a good movie.
