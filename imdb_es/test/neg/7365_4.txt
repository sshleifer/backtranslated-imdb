In general, much can be forgiven in pieces of the time that ask us to remember important historical events and to spice them up with enough loving interest for the story to continue. BATTLE OF THE BRAVE addresses the 18th century struggle for control of Quebec (all of Canada) between the British and the French, with sidebars forming the new America. It has the characteristics of an epic of fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of the writer Pierre Billon (whose script deserves a Razzie award for the worst of the season) and the scattered, unfocused and confused direction of Jean Beaudin, this film is a failure - a tedious movie of two and a quarter hours. <br /> <br /> Even a cast of excellent actors - combining Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur, adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu as Le curé Thomas Blondeau, and the likes of Irène Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in wigs of the period), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolfe - does not help. Veteran actors like these must have shrunk before the crude lines written for his characters! It covers all the mess with a musical music by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film that should be avoided. It's sad to say such bad things about an expensive project, but be careful ...
