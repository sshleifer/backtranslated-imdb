I can not believe that they have even released such a movie. The only good performance came from the water in the movie. This has to be one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The only terrifying part of the movie is the bad acting, I give this movie a 1, I'm very kind. , this movie deserves a 0. <br /> <br /> The story, and if you can call it the plot of the movie, it seems to have been written by a high school kid. Anyway, you must ask yourself if you could have been better with better actors. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to be shown on television. <br /> <br /> AND, THEN, LOOKING AT IT, IT WILL BE A LOSS OF TIME.
