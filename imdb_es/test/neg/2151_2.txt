I'm not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was a mockery of a Western "B". The story line was regular, but the filming, editing and acting were simply bad. In addition, the background music was irritating endlessly, too loud and non-stop. Many times the dialogue about background music could not be distinguished. I'm in SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and I do some shots in Old West with them, and a lot of the actors are members of this group, that's why I bought it. If you're not interested in this group of people or that sport, chances are you do not even have this little bit of interest in helping with the movie. The performance of even the veteran actors (particularly Stella Stevens) also left much to be desired.
