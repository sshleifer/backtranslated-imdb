I'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey's work, but this is a low quality movie. If you think it seems interesting, or if you saw it and liked it, go see "The General" by John Boorman. It is basically the same type, but it is very superior in all aspects (and it does not suffer the glorifications of Hollywood).
