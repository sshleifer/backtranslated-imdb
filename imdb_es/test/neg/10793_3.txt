Exploitation of the adventure of the abysmal pulp in the gender of the jungle woman. Lousy audio happily hides silly dialogue. And it's very bad for a movie about people who do not speak English. There are no adventures to find here; It is an adventure in the jungle with fangs and a wild animal attack that occurs in a flashback. <br /> <br /> Three pale-faced mounts roam the African desert and encounter tribes of hungry Amazons fighting against them. These wild women have left the Stone Age only to invent the makeup, shoes and hair removal technology in the armpits. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd", the ladies insist that they will fight against men and burn the weakest. <br /> <br /> The only thing of interest, as if there were any doubt, is the assortment of young women dressed in skins of animals intelligently designed as the bathing suits of 1951. A lot of struggle and dances badly mixed with movements Stripper of the 50s without strips. Not naked or appreciable violence. On the other hand, you may be humming the catchy native song for days.
