Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews published by supposed critics, I was surprised to discover that almost all the initial revisions, 38, rated this film with a 10. In comparison with other great films, these critics considered that Quick and the Undead is a better movie. that, The 6th Sense (8.2), Saving Private Ryan (8.4), Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8) to name a few. We expect these shills to use their next Lasik procedure at a discount, as far as they know, because it is completely obvious that these revisions have been falsified. <br /> <br /> They made me believe that this film presented a unique concept in the genre. of making zombie movies. Unfortunately, when looking at Quick and the Undead, it is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who participated in the production or who have a great interest in the commercialization and financial success of the films. Nothing confirms it in my mind more than to hear that a part of this film was filmed in Texas, and, by chance, the first praise publications of the film are mentioned. The culture of the movie Zombie / Horror B in general is an indulgent group, but this film is sadly beyond redemption. The characters are recycled and the plot is deficient. The quality of the film was not bad enough to be labeled as a camcorder, and at least they used a film-quality camera. The acting is horrible, the star tries unsuccessfully to leave as Clint Eastwood wants to be a clone. Christ on a bicycle! Even the name of the main actor is Clint. He was just terrible. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood is that the leader is using the "wood" of Eastwood's name in his acting style. Zombie makeup was above the quality of the Halloween party, but it was not fully applied to the undead cast members. Assigning zombies were not invented in their hands. The plot was so preposterous that it made me wait for a power cut, a spot on the DVD disc or that the zombies would call their attention to the director. Maybe the movie has been valid for some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Luckily, I used my free rental coupon to watch this DVD. Maybe this movie will be rescued by Nott Entertainment (with an appropriate name) by releasing a special DVD for collectors, which will tie loose flaws and deliver the promised goods? Somehow, I think NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Hopefully in its next release, The Flesh Keeper is really a "guardian" of a movie ... and not a fifth generation recycled version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Friends crossed their fingers here ... but only if you care.
