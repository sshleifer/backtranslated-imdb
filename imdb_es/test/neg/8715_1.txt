It is surprising that some people saw this as an art. We saw it as a badly filmed movie (shaky hand camera and all), (generally) misinterpreted, without scripts that looked more like a high school movie project with children experimenting on making black and white films. Injecting mounds of poetry instead of a story does not make an art film. When we saw this in the theater, people started having fits of giggles (including us) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent and meandering disorder. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our sweets and popcorn, we would have left the theater with the other two dozen people who packed their bags and went out in search of something more interesting to do!
