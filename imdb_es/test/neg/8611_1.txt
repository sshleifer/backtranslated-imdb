This movie is very bad. The hero can not play. You see too much that he learned his walking movements by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He only walks to places and leaves ... As if the story were so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring scenes of "resemblance to suspensions". <br /> <br /> The dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lot of "hello" and a few "hangs up" in the first part. <br /> <br /> The blood is orange like the Mercurochrome that you put in the blisters of children. And the scenes do not follow themselves. A bloody neck in one scene, a clean neck in the following. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yes, I mean, what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial arts? Where? Is that martial arts? Look how hesitant and slow are the movements !!!!! If kicking and getting punched is called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee. <br /> <br /> The only good point I have found is in the fight scenes: they do not play with zoom and quick change of scenes that gives you a headache in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are great. That was just to make money. Nothing else.
