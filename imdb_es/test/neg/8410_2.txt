With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works like a low-rated horror, but as an important follow-up statement to the original, it wobbles miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start to look promising during the opening credits of the telefilm ... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black crib with the cross protruding and inverted; the kitchen knife that Rosemary took to Castevette's apartment and dropped it in shock (the utensil protruding from the hardwood floor is shown); and the emptiness of Bramford himself, without tenants or furniture (the voice-overs can be heard here from the dialogue of the previous film). It is also interesting Easter egg hunt in which the titular child participates (eggs and baskets are also black). Once the story begins to roll, it never "rolls" ... And what happens to Rosemary when she gets on that bus without a driver and they take her to God knows where she is? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a poor substitute of Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as the southwestern whore who raises the child, "Adrian / Andrew") direct this cast of almost stars, with Ruth Gordon repeating his role as "Minnie". <br /> <br /> Although it's not a total failure, this type sequel should have been released first in book form, so maybe we could all have been a little better informed ... And it's not totally in the dark. A fairly recent follow-up novel, "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate follow-up of Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
