Beware of Seagal fans. It does not do action scenes until almost an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal RUNS AWAY of numerous fights, letting Ja Rule lose each battle convincingly. Actually, Ja Rule could be a budding action star, but Hollywood needs to be let at least reach puberty (what should happen in a few more years ...)? The girl in this atrocity looks like a backup singer of Christina Aguilera. Return to Seagal. When it is finally released, it is your double of risk (PADENADO DE FORTALEZA to look like the swollen Seagal) doing a lot of work and taking the cataracts. I do not remember any aikido, either. It's just your standard shots and strokes that you would see in any turkey martial arts direct to the video. Not even "so bad, it's fun", either. Just bored ...
