I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and that's great, but that's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this film is cheese. I never really understood the plot or why the boy was stealing girls. That does not make sense, but hey ... why they were in a random club was also curious. Many parts of this movie do not make sense, but in general I was interested. It was confusing on many levels ... maybe I'm not indie enough for this movie, but judging by the final scene B, they ran out of money, just cut some things and forgot the plot. Its low budget and so it seems. I like the fact that they used small special effects that were bad, but they did not use any that were of quality. I would say that this film is the bad script par excellence, with a good production. It's definitely not as random as many movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle just do not make sense together. In effect, I would give an exception to the final battle when all effects were 1950 on my butt. Sparks of models and similar. See if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. The theater of mystery science has a candidate.
