Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who avoids the murder of a senator, but in the process finds a conspiracy and has a tracker in the queue. The tracker, by the way, is doubled at the Phillips termination. The most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheeseball action movie is, of course, Robocop and even though that movie had some imagination and real energy, it only has a real-life kickboxing champion who runs away from a robot. The movie is not so horrible, since it is empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set to be cut by several shots. Don Wilson, as always, is terrible in the main role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (poor)
