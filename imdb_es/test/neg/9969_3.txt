OK, last night, on August 18, 2004, I had the clear displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a screening of the film The Manson Family at Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. This is what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious theft of every film by Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam that I have seen in my life. Second, in a brief question and answer session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the real members of the Manson family or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he did not want to have anything what to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) in the trial, having seen everything from his living room on television and in the news (and I suppose in the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter, which imitated directly through the narrative). . So I had doubts about the questions, I asked if he was trying to present the version of outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll and not necessarily the true story. This question, obviously, angered the already erased director who started shouting "Fuck! Shut up! This is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh **!" <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I did not even think how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the film's motto: "You've heard the side of the laws of history ... now listen to the story as told by the Manson family. " Excuse me, if this man has never talked to the family and considers them liars with whom he does not want anything to do, how in the name of God can he tell them the story? This is the most ridiculous statement I've heard! The film was obviously aimed at the public of sex drugs and rock 'n roll that had no trouble attracting the small and dimly lit theater, and was even more obviously engendered by sex drugs and the rock' n roll mind of a man who He could not even watch his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to go for more beer or shout a kind of Rocky Horrors call line to the actors on the screen. This film accomplishes little more than distorting the public image of real events (which helped shape the state of America and much of today's world) in a sort of fantasy Slasher / Comic Book / Porno / Rape dreamed by an obviously superficial individual. br /> <br /> The movie was definitely very impressive to watch. The soundtrack was refreshing, as it contained real samples of Charlie's work with the family outside of his album Lie. The edition was pleasant and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of the most modern music videos. All in all, this film would have been a much better addition to the catalogs on Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or, for that matter, to the minds of the intellectual observers. I felt like I was in a midnight Rocky Horror watching the way the audience dressed and behaved (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good, with the exception of Charlie, who looked more like a drugged enthusiast of Dragons and Dungeons rather than the actual role he was playing. The descriptions that the film gave of him were full of energy, throwing ten things at him and being very physical about it, but they did not coincide at all with the slow, lethargic and chubby representation that really showed up. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie basically explains itself when Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) states at the end: "You can write a lot of bullsh books ** or make a lot of movies from bullsh ** ... etc. Etc. "Case in point. Even the disclaimer "Based on a true story" is a dead giveaway, which indicates that somewhere beneath this psychedelic dump is the basis of a real story with content that will make a difference in the world. All you have to do is a bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the shit, or really, maybe you could just avoid everything and read a book instead. <br /> <br /> All I can say is like that, when the movie was over, I got a free beer, so I'm glad I went, but not so much that I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut up the shit for asking the director a question. Peace.
