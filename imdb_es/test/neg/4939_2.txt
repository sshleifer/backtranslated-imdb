Hi, today I saw this movie in the middle (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it would be worth seeing. Also the comments here were pretty good, but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly realized that this movie is not close to 5.6! It's just boring. You can describe the movie with a few words and it is also just the story of the standard horror movie with all the scenes of standard horror movies. I do not know why people still like those movies or why those movies vote better than a 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> A lot of people who come from somewhere or go / drive anywhere. They meet in some way on their trip, strange people, but hopefully they are nice, so go out with them. Then, a very important scene for each horror movie "Oh, my cell phone does not work oh my oh also ... it's weird, but we do not need them, so enjoy our trip ..." uhhhhhh, our strange person is A better weird psychopath we all sit down and scream for a while until he starts cutting off parts of us or killing some of us. After a while, the group of victims has a weapon or the opportunity to escape a rumor that they never think about escaping or even killing the psychopath if they have the opportunity, they only talk about what to do until the psychopath recovers his weapon with some of the few. of the standard tricks they got in those movies and everyone running as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... ah, and in the end it becomes really exciting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes, some of the victims they can escape wow great movies ... Okay, if I had never seen such a movie, I would say it is a movie that can be seen, but if someone sees any movie of this type, it should be just a boring waste of time because almost everything in the movie. You know it even before you see it, because every time it runs like the standard horror movie. .... mmm maybe there is a Windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can simply press some adjustment buttons and get the new type of movie Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
