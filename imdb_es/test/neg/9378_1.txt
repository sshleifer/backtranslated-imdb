August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Knights: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the greats of all time and I've been a fan of him since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor I had not read reviews or had prior knowledge of the film. The movie surprised me a lot. The scenery and the views were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my opinion, this was not one of his best movies, it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. For me, going to this movie was a waste of time. I will continue going to your movies and I will add your movies to my video collection. But I can not see spending money to put this movie in my collection
