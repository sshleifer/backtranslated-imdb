Sir, this sucks. There is a particular type of film of sexual revolution of the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This movie is an example. I lost count of how many times women are slapped, beaten, whipped or whipped in the movie. And then there are all the times when the women in the movie fantasize about being slapped, beaten, whipped or whipped (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it's ostensibly part of the safe fetish game. Other times it is not, but will wait in vain to see the heroine inform the authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we heard that his rapist gave him a lecture about his inability to "get carried away." <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie reeks of misogyny (speaking as a heterosexual, white and married man in his late 30s). , is not a study of studies on teenage lesbian women with a chip on their shoulders, so you do not get the wrong idea). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only good thing about this movie is that it provides a clear reminder of how bad it is. Things were really for women only a few decades ago.
