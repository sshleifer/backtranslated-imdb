The only reason why there is a question mark in parentheses is NOT because I have not seen all the movies released in 2001 so far. It's because this movie was only PARTIALLY made in 2001. The rest was stolen from OTHER dinosaur movies by Roger Corman, Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's "Aliens" that it's not even funny. But I love it. I can not explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the sets, I liked the cinematography, I liked how they borrowed from "Aliens". It's a little ironic that Cameron, at one point, was a student of Corman, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I'm the owner of the Carnosaurios trilogy on DVD, and all I can say that for the first part is that it has moments. The most I can say about the third is that it took me five years to find it. <br /> <br /> Now we have "Raptor", which DOES NOT continue that series. Instead, he borrows complete scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around him. And somehow, Roger Corman was able to get Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now, I'm not saying that Roberts or Bernsen are in any kind of career. But both were in a moment what could be called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Of course, the actors react to the effects that they will not even see while filming all the time. Here, however, they are reacting to mismatched images of movies that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "Carnosaur 1". Apparently it made a lot of sense to recover the original boy. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old dinosaur models of "Carnosaur". Apparently, after this interview, Corman decided that he would not even do that. And it's not like I could not find an FX team to do it. The script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story should be based on pre-existing archive images. <br /> <br /> Do not compare this with Ed Wood. Ed did better than this. At least he only used Bela's footage once, in a movie. There are ways to incorporate footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes this technique poorly seen to a new minimum. Even if you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
