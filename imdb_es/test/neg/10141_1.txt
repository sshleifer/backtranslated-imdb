This really is a "good" series ... everyone in it is pretty good. But I can not take Reba. She is trying to be funny, but she just is not, and then she has a stupid accent !! If they took it out of the program, I'd love to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I have been watching the program in 10 minutes and, as I said before, Reba is destroying the program. however, the 20-year-old boy (I do not know his name) but he's so funny, and he's really saving everything ... <br /> <br /> so here's the recipe for a great show. kick Reba and then put the 20 year old in the lead role. <br /> <br /> I really hope someone agrees with me and thinks (like me) that I should kick Reba from the show and put another person in the lead role
