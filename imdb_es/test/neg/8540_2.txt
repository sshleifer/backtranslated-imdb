Good old Jess Franco! The always reliable choice of director in case you are looking for a low demanding sleaze, a blatant exploitation and a 200% gratuity. Jess, once again, really surpassed himself with this "adventure" in the jungle. Let's face it, this movie is basically an excuse for the actress Katja Bienert to parade in topless. Actually, it is a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film shot naked in front of a whole team and, in particular, before the eyes of the pervert Franco! And it was not even the first time, since the duo had already done "Linda" together. Anyway, just in case you asked yourself: YES, "Diamantes del Kilimanjaro" has a plot, although very imbecile. During the opening, the sequences of an airplane, aboard a rich Scottish man and a girl, crash in the middle of an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because never in a moment of the film did they even try to consume human flesh. The hateful Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows to become the beautiful and sparsely dressed White Goddess. Several years later, an expedition arrives in the middle of the jungle to return the girl to civilization and ... Even more important: steal some of the legendary diamonds of the tribe. This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco obviously could not be bothered. Why filming chase sequences in the jungle or bloody cannibal rites when you can point your camera to a hot young girl sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings simply seem to be filmed in someone's garden and there are a lot of images of National Geographic wildlife edited awkwardly to fill in the gaps of continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" as an ingenious, feminist and adult version of Tarzan. Yes, of course, they just put that phrase there because the character of Katja Bienert changes from one tree to another using a couple of times.
