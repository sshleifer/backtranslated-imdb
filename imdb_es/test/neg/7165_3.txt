I liked some of the characters, but our advantage was based too much on a charming smile. I did not care about two tricks about him. He made bad decisions and I really did not care since he did not look like either. He seemed quite unintelligent. There were a couple of moments that offered the opportunity to get a human perspective (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the film. The love interest was acceptable and the other characters were slightly interesting, but the plot twists too much and left me wanting in many points of the film. In the end, I asked myself why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are some timidly comical moments, but in the end I did not care. I can not imagine a higher rating of the movie. - 3 out of 10
