Unfortunately, this is not as good as any of the other films in which Jim Carrey (producer and protagonist) and Brian Grazer have worked together, but it's worth checking out some snippets. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) believes that they are promoting him to a better job. That is until the Dynocorpe company sinks and closes. Now Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni), and their son, of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can not raise the amount of money they really want. Then they start to steal some places. And then they decide to steal the guy who rode Dick, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ridiculous bits are when Carrey is in the elevator singing "I Believe I Can Fly" and the bit when he ties someone up in a robbery and is talking to a voice changer (sounds like a fucking robot). Good!
