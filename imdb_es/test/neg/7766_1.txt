The first time I saw this, I retreated in HORROR before what was presented as modern and liberated women. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not relate to the idiots whose lives revolve around sex without love and the acquisition of Gucci. , Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The worrying thing is that some may really think that this is how women live in New York. It definitely is not. These women are incredibly superficial and materialistic, and, as another critic said, they act like addicts to gold. <br /> <br /> This is not a condition of a liberated woman and I am glad that she has left. 0 stars and simply INCREDIBLE
