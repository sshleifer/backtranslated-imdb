For a film that was the most watched in South Korea for most of 2004, it was a big disappointment. It shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make films that are too emotional and melodramatic. The film lasted more than 130 minutes, but in reality it did not happen much and everything that happened was practically what was expected, the plot was transparent. Of course, if one of them was Korean, maybe he would do it more, but for me he did not do much. Suffice to say that, as often happens with Korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the north and south of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train a squad of elite assassins of prisoners sentenced to death to assassinate Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A tedious plot does not bother me much if the characters are good, but unfortunately that is not the case. The case this time either. They are stereotypes and most of the performances are mediocre and, all too often, exaggerated, as is often the case in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and less to showing us how hard and cruel the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that does remind us is that one of the two less serious errors is still wrong.
