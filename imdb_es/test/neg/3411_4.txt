The first of the three Aztec Mummies films is the only one that, in my opinion, was never completely dubbed into English. The film was cut and used in pieces by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make The Face of the Screaming The Werewolf.) He appeared in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere .) The longest of the three films, a good part of this film composes the two later films that use this as a base for flash backs. The plot of this film has a scientist who performs a regression experiment to past lives that makes his subject travel back and discover hidden cameras in an Aztec pyramid. The group, as well as a sinister figure known as the Murci√©lago, hope to use the information to discover a hidden treasure. Instead, they discover a living mummy that has other plans. Long and long sinuous, this film has very little action to keep its execution time of 80 minutes (what is worse, the mummy does not even appear until an hour has passed). Probably the smallest of the three films, it's easy to see why this movie was cut, it's the only way to create a movie that does not induce sleep. Seeing the movie late last night, I found myself struggling to stay awake. It was a difficult journey and I discovered that I ended up scanning to the point where the mummy appeared. Given the option, I would take a pass and watch the last two movies.
