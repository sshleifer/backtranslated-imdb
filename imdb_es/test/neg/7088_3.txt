This is another of the anti-communist polemics of Hollywood of the fifties. The American unconditional Gene Barry, the lovely Englishwoman Valerie French and three other people were kidnapped by an alien and given clams with a fantastic and fantastically vague power. What will the earthlings do with such power? Throw it to the sea or use it to eliminate all humanity? Anyone who knows the American cinema of 1957 knows the answer to what the communists will do, but the story matures when Americans really put things to the test in the middle of the Pacific. Then, a scientist, only with the supreme power in the universe, proposes his own theory and uses it. His elegant attitude afterwards is nauseating, and the joyful disposition of everyone else is appalling. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the covers have a mathematical code that tells the teacher that they only kill "Confirmed enemies of freedom"! That's right: do not worry about the ethical dilemma of killing all those that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hurrah! Do not go! Silly woman - and you threw yours into the sea! LOL! Kiss Me Baby!
