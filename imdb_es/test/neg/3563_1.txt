Conclusion: very, very, very boring, however, I observed until the end, expecting some effect upside down, but the ending was worse, because it was nothing. The old black and white game did not help at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but this was not the case. The script, the plot, etc., were linear, they had no substance, nothing incoming. When you deal with the psychological, you deal with the analysis, therefore with the details, that unity-diversity formula ... there was no essence, there was no detail. Only one story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of the filmmakers ... well, this is not the only one.
