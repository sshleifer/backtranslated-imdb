It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to remove the Othello from Shakespeare, taking it to the modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to achieve it. However, there were extra bodies to help put everything in perspective. John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, causing the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, which finally ended in the death of Dessie. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. He did not give enough evidence for Dessie to be cheating on Othello, with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just made everyone a friend and gave a reason why she "was" cheating. In the play, it was much more convincing on Iago's part to make Othello suspect something. This change made the film more about anger for the wrong reasons, than it was based on the book. However, the movie had some good points. He turned the scenes of the army into a more racist group towards the blacks, where Othello is the chief head of the police squad. These scenes are made credible by furious crowds and fires. You can feel the amount of racism in the movie, more than you can in the book. This book shows the scenes of today by making it much easier to understand than the Shakespearean times in which it was written. In the play, Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets Othello's position. He never gets what he deserves and they never catch him for telling Othello the lie until it's too late. I saw this as a disadvantage in the film, because I feel that the villain is given his promotion treasure for lying, and in the book, Rodrigo discovers it. In general, the film could have done a better job depending on the work than what it did. I feel that the director of the film omitted some of the most important parts of the work that were mentioned or that are there to make the work flow, or that it is more of a tragedy. I would say that you must first read the book, to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you might find yourself lost and confused.
