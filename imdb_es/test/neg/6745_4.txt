I speak badly of G.I.J.:T.M. Especially because I think he lacked something that G.I. Joe had Yes. He had something that G.I. Joe did not like the celebrity cameos of Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The film lacked a passion for the characters that G.I. Joe had television series. Most of the artists of the announcers really sounded like they were dead and they were going to die at any moment. It's a good movie, but I would not say it was the best movie in the world I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe relied on what I would say that Serpentor beating Duke in his chest was not the best way to get Charlie Adler's character out. Neither was Golobulus reminded of the Cobra Commander why he was chosen to lead Cobra's forces and then he was mutilated horribly after he failed to deliver what Cobra-La felt was rightfully his. <br /> <br /> It was not the best way for the GI Joe goes out of series but it's better than nothing. :)
