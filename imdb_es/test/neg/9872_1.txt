It is true that, when I had the opportunity to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were quite low. They were not low enough. The school teacher, Roger Corman, somehow became the owner of the rights to produce Marvel comics characters sometime in the late 80s or early 90s, and handed it to Oley Sassone, whose Management work has been largely in television series such as "Hercules" and "VÃ­bora". With an assumed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, filmed and briefly released on video and then sent to the desert of a forgotten movie. There should have been there. However, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, these "Fantastic Four" settle into the ether hoping to cause a sudden blow to those rare people, so unfortunate and so foolish as to step on it. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very loyal to the source material, and that's the only thing they deserve credit for in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develops superhuman powers when the armor on their experimental ship fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes' Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to escape from her body. Finally, Ben Grimm ('credited' to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then known as The Thing. There is a prologue that configures a former Reed partner, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become his enemy, Dr. Doom, who organizes the sabotage of the Fantastic Four's space flight as an act of revenge for the injuries that blame Reed. . There is the configuration, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and, ultimately, a climactic fight. There are more details about the script badly written, but they are insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is a film that was made simply because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word.There is not a lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the rights legal to do it. Undoubtedly, the plot will be reflected in the anticipated big budget release that Tim Story will direct in 2005, but addressing a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic madness. The special effects that exist are mostly hand-drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original "The Great Train Robbery". When half of the climatic fight returns to be a complete animation, you are almost relieved to see a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were condemned to participate in this project. There is also very little consistency of style in this mess. Most scenes are recorded in light or wild colors, and the only outfits are the obvious pieces of science fiction. There is camera work, but mainly it is about keeping the characters focused on the screen and the minimum information flows to the audience. The edition includes leaving additional lines and using obvious wipes (at one point, there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). Spin editing is even used to complement poor special effects when The Thing is transformed. The only scene in which the transformation technology was used was shocking just because it was such a positive quality jump. <br /> <br /> Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks', only the most basic movements of the camera are used and there is almost no style. It worked for that movie because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his reach. 'The Blair Witch Project' caused some audiences to suffer dizziness because of the hand and spasmodic things that united that pseudo-documentary. When everything was said and done, it was an effective work on the terror of being lost and being consumed by a terrifying situation. There is no sense of history or theme here on a spoken or visual level. With these 'Fantastic Four', you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the filmmakers and the artists seem to be really trying to compete with other comic movies with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> Any movie involves a lot of time and work. It's so sad that both of them poured into a project like this. If you are one of the people involved in this, it is most likely that you became a stepping stone on the road to a film career (with better luck). Everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. For those who are curious to see this film, my advice is to only do it with a group of friends (so that everyone can point and say "you also saw it") that have been warned about the experience (so that nobody leaves hurt). of concussion), and perhaps you can devise a drinking game to relieve the pain between accidental laughter. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
