Acolytes presents an interesting combination of original concepts in the cliché of "screaming adolescent" with a more exciting rhythm. In a way, Acolytes is very successful, but in many other aspects, the film fails miserably. <br /> <br /> In general, Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the innocence and naivety of young people from endless horror films like Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other movies in which unsuspecting and relatively innocent teenagers , innocents, they have sexual relations, they run screaming and one by one they are uprooted by some kind of monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but they did not do so because of their own personal demons. In the end, he was left with the feeling that there were no (and maybe no) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film is also very much about following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of whether the main character would become the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Through all of this, the filmmakers also incorporated a lot of clichés, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mix of depth as well. as superficiality that I found intriguing. This, perhaps without realizing it, plays well with the characters that, at first, are very superficial, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex. <br /> <br /> Technically However, the movie has many problems. Cinematography, which is generally considered highly, seems to me quite sophisticated and too stylized, and uses 2/3 approaches formulated too rigidly. Many transitions that I felt were too stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also widely used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation to achieve a pretty twisted end, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. The methods used to solve the climax are cheap and poorly prepared, the motivations are not always clear, and the main points of the plot remain unleashed at the end. <br /> <br /> In general, the relative originality, the themes and the thesis of the film are lost in a labyrinth of poor technical execution, too stylized images, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap turns kept only for lack of information or totally incorrect. <br /> <br /> If the film was executed better, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.
