I've only seen most of the series since I left TV as background noise in my bedroom. <br /> <br /> I've been a Mencia fan, but this program does not really do much for me. From time to time he will say or do something to get rid of laughter, but he has an aura of sufficiency that ruins it completely. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his raging, angry man routine. That is not terribly frequent in this television series. Instead, he is simply cocky. I guess that reflects how funny your comedy is: stagnant and uninteresting when you're not in the right delivery mode. Sometimes I've seen him get into his program, but for the most part, he just sits there smiling and smugly, and it does not fit. <br /> <br /> But only my opinion.
