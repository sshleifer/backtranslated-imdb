So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher, who lost his partner in a drug investigation, surprise surprise, Colombia! Not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my last name), and now he's a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies make you believe, there are other things besides drug dealers and The cocaine that leaves Colombia! <br /> <br /> In any case, in a drug campaign that went wrong, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to confess, somewhere that I've never seen. I saw him go before in any of his films, before or after. Actually it was quite interesting. Seagal has a tendency to seem almost asexual by the way she never gets too involved with other women other than a plot device and the way in which the occasional seduction attempt, whether by a stripper or a lover, never wakes up the slightest interest. the. He is all bad guys all the time. <br /> <br /> But in the confession booth, he confesses he lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (I hope not Am I getting into trouble with God by telling you this ??). The priest tells him to go with his family, so he decides it is time to withdraw from the force. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is an exercise in the characterization of thin paper characteristic of Seagal films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretion about promoting their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher revisits his former high school coach, Max (a minimal effort from Keith David), and right in the middle of the practice, there are some of these head addicts locked in the stands They sell cracks to some schoolgirls with the look of a bookworm. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just had a protected experience in high school, but I did not know crack dealers and crack addicts were in school in the middle of the day. In any case, it's not long before Hatcher finds out how evil these guys are. Not only are they selling crack to high school kids, but the coach has been losing soccer players regularly for their drugs, gets involved in looks with Max, and since that is not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in his crack house. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's fine. We get the image. I am sure that they also torture the puppies and beat the old women, and maybe they also steal sweets from the children, just in case. Is it really that difficult to establish who the bad guys are? 13-year-old niece died at his crack house. Wow <br /> <br /> Anyway. The film not only does not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically comes down to insults, where the evil acts are assigned to them through dialogue, but they also do not know how to act. <br /> <br /> The leader of the drug dealers, is called Screwface, and I guess I should just tell him something about the kind of movie he is. Screwface is a cartoon Jamaican man with these bright and strangely green eyes, which I suppose should be an important part of his character because he spends most of his time on screen with half his eyes popped out of his head. His favorite means of intimidation is screaming really loud with his Jamaican accent exaggeratedly exalted with his face literally less than an inch away from whoever is screaming at him. This guy likes to put himself so in the face of the guys that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses do not touch each other. All I could think about was how the poor would deal with their breathing. <br /> <br /> Man, they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican, by the way. His accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that for most of the film it is almost impossible to understand them. It does not matter. No matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of your mouth is a kind of evil thing related to drugs, it's just the psychopaths that sell and kill people. The movie must have been a great success in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that the theatricality, particularly the bad ones, as I have described, is spectacularly ridiculous, even for a Seagal movie. They are so caricatured and strange that it is impossible to take them as something more than a creation of a silly fool movie, something that is slapped to provide food to whom Seagal can distribute his trademark characteristic of retribution. <br /> <br /> But there is also a strange mysticism in the movie that makes everything seem strange. For example, a mystic, I suppose you would call it, at some point throws some kind of curse on Screwface (if I remember correctly) by spitting Bacardi bites on a live rooster that is hanging upside down before decapitating it and spilling its blood on an image of Screwface. Hmm Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is this same woman who warns Hatcher that her family has been "marked for death" by these people, which means that they have some voodoo spell on them. Not to disparage anyone, but if they told me that my family had been cursed by people like that, I would laugh at that. Hatcher does not strike me as the kind of person who does a great deal of damned voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> But the configuration, as you can see, is pretty standard for a Seagal movie. Unique villains, I suppose you could say, although not very impressive. Definitely the rarest movie of Seagal's early career?
