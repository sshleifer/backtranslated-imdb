As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a group of actors who, well ... are not really actors, a lot of heavy metal music to complement the rap and, of course, a crazy leather girl with attractive appearance and no hips, and prevented us from passing half of the budget. . Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in those films? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first prison inmate executed has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> First level performance, in particular, any scene that involves a tragedy for the good ones. Seriously, however, the director tried, and achieved a modern and hard edge for the movie as best he could. He went to the well too often and HALF PAST DEAD got bored too soon. What else can you do when the inmates just chat while the hostages continually ask what motivates the main villain? A nonsensical action movie that amounts to little, if not "right".
