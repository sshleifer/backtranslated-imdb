This espionage melodrama has a nice cast, almost promising, and it should have been very atmospheric; There is a will, or an intention of the atmosphere, and also a lack, or a lack of it. <br /> <br /> Sheen plays a dissident who is now active as an agent, a loner, loved by women. But haughty Mrs. Fossey is your lover. Neill plays the gallant, generous and gentlemanly Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are essentially annoying; Finlay makes a cameo, and also other known actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; but, again, she always is. <br /> <br /> I will be your true friend and I will tell you. The film is low in suspense and in emotion, it is trivial and quite boring. The good thing is that you can see Mrs. Fossey naked. Apart from that, warm from the exploitation of espionage.
