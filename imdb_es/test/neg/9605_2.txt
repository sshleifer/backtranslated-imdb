Normally I do not bother to waste my time writing comments for trash like this one I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie yesterday on one of the Comcast Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can not give any rational reason why I watched this movie until the end. It always amazes me that attractive women are willing to appear in frightening movies like this, but I guess she thought that this movie would lead to something better. I hope she was right, for her sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a riot of direct laughter at too typical video, or just a piece of junk, according to your point of view. While there are some decent moments of action in this movie, they do not really connect well with the story, just as it is. <br /> <br /> The configuration, as I recall, involved Carol Alt as a depression. Housewife who believes that her husband, a policeman, deceives her. There was also something about her son's death in an accident, and she blamed him, but before the story went to a place, she shot him and killed him. <br /> <br /> In the same fateful night, an injured stranger comes to her door and she is taken care of, and almost immediately her house is being besieged by government minions and mercenaries trying to capture the stranger, who seems to have almost superhuman combat skills. <br /> <br /> This same type of material has produced decent entertainment many times before, especially in Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity, and I could have done it this time too, but this particular movie was disappointed by production values deficient and a terrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie really falls apart at the end, when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) who was programmed to be a cop, and after discovering that Carol Alt killed her husband, he tries kill her! The movie was not particularly good until this time, but the ending really ruins it when trying to turn a modest action thriller into an aspiring Terminator / Robocop. The film was a bit excessive at the end, with the insane cyborg pulling out the eye of poor Carol Alt before she finally bit the dust. What was the point of that? For that matter, what was the point of nothing in this movie? It caught my attention and it entertained me for about an hour, until the end, when it reminded me that I was not watching a first-rate movie. Actually, it was not even a second-rate movie. <br /> <br /> The final scenes seem to suggest a sequel, which I think never happened, although I have not checked it carefully. The web for it. Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to see any sequel to this movie.
