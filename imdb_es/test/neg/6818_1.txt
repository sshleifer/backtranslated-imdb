Completely ridiculous movie that mocks the process of admission to the university. While it is true that the SAT exams are not all to evaluate the admission of a student in college, what the film says is absolutely ridiculous and not worth repeating or seeing. <br /> <br /> College admission officers are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the whole process. The film is an insult to high school students who work hard, work hard and then have to go through a long process until they receive a letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have requested. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be rejected at all levels.
