I think this movie had very poor production value. The lack of action makes me think that they should mark it as an early docudrama. You may not have had money available for its manufacture. I feel bad that it was a mistake in the Major League for Jackie Robinson. <br /> <br /> I think he was much better than many of the white players of his time. It had to be really great to break the color barrier of the time. I can not say that this was a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> I wish there was more information about its creators. It is possible that they were limited by the quality of the actors who were willing to take on the project. Maybe there is no money to get good people.
