The depressing BLACK black comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who runs away from home on Christmas Eve when she discovers that her husband (Tony Goldwyn) has hired an assassin to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically, Farrow keeps running and is always with very strange people and gets into badly carefree situations. <br /> <br /> This was announced as a good movie when I saw her at Christmas in her VERY short career in an art cinema. . I found him sick, without grace and simply depressing. I like black humor, but this was too dark for me. What happened to the character of Parker in particular was horrifying. To make matters worse, Eileen Brennan is cast as a nun (!!!) later and proceeds to chew the landscape with gusto. <br /> <br /> The only salvation was Farrow's performance, it's much better than this. Image deserved It was also a relief to see the talented Stephen Dorff appear at the end. The ending itself was nice, but it could not erase what had happened before. <br /> <br /> "Comedy" sick, morbid and black. 1
