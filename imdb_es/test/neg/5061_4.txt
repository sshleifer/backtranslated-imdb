Angel-A is a change of pace for Besson; Monochrome, mawkish and quite mediocre. It is well photographed in Paris, although subtitle readers should keep in mind: quick dialogue and good photography can make you frustrated. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life". Despite their shared themes (the celestial intervention avoids suicide, the relations between angels and mortals ensue), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. Even moments of good action, tearful, descend quickly to the curling sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The film's flawed ideology irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for himself is constantly undermined by his own violent and promiscuous behavior; a "happy ending" that denies the supposed journey of the hero of helplessness to self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Verdict: It's nice enough to see but confusing moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine. 4/10
