The third film based on the work of Charles Belden entitled "The mystery of the wax museum" (1933) is aimed at the X-tasy generation. The twin writers, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other Slasher films, a promising start. Its condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not very difficult for the world's favorite heiress. She carefully reads "In Style", does a striptease of boys, talks in a cell and worries about a poorly conceived pregnancy. Your regular routine has been altered beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance, not so hot, during the parody of "1 Night in Paris" (2004). While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she jealously "searches for lip balm" in the lap of her boyfriend (Robert Ri'chard). Finally, the "actress" exposes the use of the word "N" in the sexual tape. The director Jaume Collet-Serra shapes his opinion on the issue of the twins, contrary to the theme of the past. Everyone exhibited opposite characteristics at the time, while a couple of good or bad can come out of the womb today. However, the latter does not rule out the first. The delivery is the luck of the draw. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Of course, the inmates share some similarities, such as art, disfigurement, submission and murder. However, a small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than on the outside. The "House of wax" by Collet-Serra pays homage to the actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves Van Gogh's clear puns to the imagination of the public. Still, the option to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. The unmasking of Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod receives second place, but the most terrifying in the history of horror films belongs to Lon Chaney in "The Phantom of the Opera" (1925). As far as the new contender is concerned, the consequences of separation surgery play down the effect. A surgeon should know that operating with Siamese twins heals them physically and psychologically. Your father needs to call a couple of colleagues - Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to pinch. Despite what the trailers said, "Cera" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
