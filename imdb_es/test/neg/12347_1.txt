A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposing opinions about Fujimori, but after seeing this film we agreed the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to talk about a foreign country where you were not present when the events happened, no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film. If you are really looking to learn about the history of another country, look at something made by natives of that country, otherwise you will not be able to get away from your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions on something they do not really belong to are abusing their power. To make it even worse, the director chose not to mention the shameful participation of the CIA with the Fujimori regime. He decides to avoid dealing with the only issue for which his country has a lot to explain to Peruvians. But this is not surprising because both the director and the CIA are violating Peru's sovereignty by trying to affect democratic processes at very different levels, of course. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping In Peru he would have financed a native to make the documentary. In any case there are numerous documentaries, movies and books made to the Peruvian on the subject. Such include "Eyes That Do not Come", "Days of Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: The Two Faces of the Same Currency", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. The director of the "Fall of Fujimori" should spend time analyzing the numerous problems in his own country or at least the participation of his country in the affairs of other nations.
