This film has no respect for the viewer's time. Take a 15 minute story and stretch it in 95 minutes. To achieve this, they have to use a very slow narrative and make everyone run with some unlikely frantic anguish. By the time this movie showed something interesting in the plot, I just did not care. The problem is not in the performance, but in the rhythm. The story is weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role are misplaced. His style of humor is not generic, so it is presented as a diluted version of himself. The number 23 causes great pain and frustration to people in the story, but the justification for this is never logical. At most it is a bit interesting. Jim Carrey has many more skills in a serious role than this film reveals. Do not waste your money watching this in the theater. Rent this movie if you have had trouble sleeping. If you're still awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it better than me. I also did not like the lighting and artistic aspects of film making. A lot of passive visual goodies were thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and did little to improve the already weak story.
