If you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but it seems you can not stay adrift, put this movie. The only good thing about this movie are the electric planes. Apart from that prepare yourself for some sweet zzzzz. It amazes me how stars with names as important as those in this movie can be part of one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll finish my nap.
