"San Francisco, oh marvelously desolate city, thank you, God, for destroying it and making our bricks fall on our collective heads, and for beating oblivion to tens of thousands of your innocent and obedient sheep, O Lord, who are so merciful. in your heavenly ways ... "These should have been the lyrics of the title song of this film so inspiring and absolutely meaningless. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite well, with Gable discovering a Cinderella with a highly annoying but highly appreciated operatic voice, and soon he is thrown into stardom. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if she "takes the time" to look at all that make-up and the brightness facade of the 30s, realizes that it is a little ugly. Too ugly to play this role, anyway. However, Gable and everyone else was flattering around here like it was a damn beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so humble, healthy, innocent, loving God, kind and generous, enough to make you vomit for a full hour. MacDonald plays his role (certainly one-dimensional) with the kind of "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh" that serves to annoy her instead of making her sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Tracy has been better, and had better roles to play this cliché priest, heart of gold, lover of God, priest who does not mistreat children (who fits in his "free time", as if the priests had something to do, how nice). Even the always reliable Gable does not live up to its usual standard; he is too animated and his character is too disinterested for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious Western "scoundrel" (although this, obviously, is the script's fault). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping-pong with Cinderella, using her as a ball. How? Well, first he's working (singing) for Gable, then he works for Holt Square, then he goes back to Gable and comes back very soon to Holt. (And, of course, both want to have her as a girlfriend / wife). And if the earthquake had not interrupted this parcel of table tennis, it's a sure bet that she would have been jumping back and forth another ten times, the little princess who is like her. <br /> <br /> There are many, too many, in fact, musical numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "disaster movie musical". What a fool. The things he sings in the "articulation" of Gable are fine, but when he starts emitting those acute and annoying moans during the segments of the opera, it was when I felt that my ears were unjustly attacked by the enemy. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may seem little, for those who have not had the experience of Vietoperanam first-hand with such horrors of audio torture, but it's like with dog years; The year of a dog is equivalent to seven humans. One minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog that urinates acid in your leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's more like a movie close to disaster. (I read that part of the dialogue in this film was written by a FILM DIRECTOR OF THE SILENT ERA Jesus ...) Melodramatic procedures, and only occasionally funny, are interrupted by the true star of this film (namely, the earthquake ), only after more than an hour and a half. When Joe, the earthquake finally shakes the city and our clichéd characters in it, I almost want to say "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe arrives too late to the film to save her from her growing mediocrity; The scenes of devastation are very good, but even the seismic part of the film is ruined by a very annoying religious ending. You see, Gable, who professes to be an atheist all the time (without using the word itself), finally finds MacDonald alive, after having searched for days, and suddenly becomes a believer because Cinderella is alive? How stupid! All he tells me is that Gable's character is an imbecile with a weak mind. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a very silly note, in fact. Gable, having said "thank you" to God for "saving" his little girl (and he kneels), "finds God (sees the light) and the little demon of the movie, Gable becomes a believer. fearful is the American ending ... <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody thought of asking this "God" why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place! The sad and unintentional irony is that Gable at the end he becomes an "imbecile," all the time he has mocked the "fools" who fall into the most sacred trap of all, namely, religion, and in the end he himself becomes one. I call it a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved Gable as a person, but I see it in a very different way: on the contrary: it only took a great Joe to turn Gable into a small believer, obedient, God fearing, who joins the sheep family of the world.And as if this intellectual fall of Gab it was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this first "seismic musical" ends with a real chorus of hairs (take this word as you want), noble and inspiring of hope. scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or maybe "God" fixed it?) sing together the title song with the hope of a better, brighter future without Joe . Hallelujah! If you are a "fool" for Hollywood sentimentality, do not skip this movie.
