I can not say that I was surprised by this atrocity when I saw her a couple of months or weeks ago (I do not remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed by the change of a nerd image, it's just an example of the unacceptable and despicable. , superficial, negative, partial and stereotyped, people in the entertainment business is, frankly, I am extremely angry. It was not all funny. A nerd is a stereotype and makes people feel very offended. <br /> <br /> Second, the people of Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a big house, a famous father, everything has it and Zoey is also rich. They never have to deal with the things that teenagers and teenagers have to do today, such as peer pressure and stereotype problems. Also, the actors are horrible. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be on a television show as successful as Zoey 101 (what's wrong with the world?), Has no talent as an actor. In fact, she is worse than Britney! The thing about Chase and Zoey was incredibly predictable, I mean, how could the show continue with the quotes of Zoey and Chase? What other problems could they have? Except for the fact that Chase does not get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! Absolutely worse 48 minutes of my television watching life. Forever. 0/10 (and that's being generous)
