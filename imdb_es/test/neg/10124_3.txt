When the naive young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser of Savory's Department Store, falls in love with a statue of Venus and gives a chaste kiss, Venus gets off his pedestal and gives Eddie more than he expected. This shrieking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the insane story and eliminate most of the first class songs. The purpose was to make a safe and popular film without too much investment while capitalizing Ava Gardner's upward mobility to stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie is lost in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not only naive, but wobbly and unlucky. Gardner is beautiful, but the only things that bring the film to life are Olga San Juan as the loving but jealous girlfriend of Eddie, Tom Conway as the owner of Savory and Eve Arden as the wise and astute secretary of Savory. It is a role that Arden could play in her dream, and she is good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a great star. The only point of a musical, however, is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was meant to be a kind of social satire, Kurt Weill, composer and Ogden Nash writing the lyrics, they created a series of elegant and witty songs and a masterpiece. Without satire, or smart songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the film becomes a weak fantasy comedy in which much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is made to death. <br /> <br /> The producers of the film not only released almost all the Weill / Nash songs, but they brought the film's musical director, Ann Ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that they survived. acute observation in the amorous romance. Ronell was not a hack; She wrote Willow Weep for Me. I wonder what he was thinking about as he replaced or modified the clever work of Ogden Nash. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is Weill / Nash's masterpiece. "Speak Low" is a love song as good as anyone has written. He has received one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments from Eileen Wilson doubling Gardner. Dick Haymes brings a chorus. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood who became one of the leading music directors, as well as a songwriter and writer. Yours for a song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made the business, like Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those of you who want to hear how little of the Weill / Nash score was recorded by the original Broadway cast, you may be able to track the CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is combined with Lute Song, another Broadway show that Martin starred in.
