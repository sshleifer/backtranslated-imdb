The emergence of Quentin Tarantino and his dubious influence on people like Guy Ritchie may have triggered the wave of ghastly British gangster films that have bequeathed us in recent years, but one of our most famous actor exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to the trash like this. I just wish you took a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal benefit that you admit you use often. It not only stifles YOUR talent, but also the promise of future originality of British films. <br /> <br /> None of the characters in this movie are sympathetic or remotely realistic, and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and a colorful language. Caine does not give the material more effort than it deserves. If this was intended to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace to "King Lear," it would have helped me greatly if I had been concerned about the ultimate fate of the directors, rather than simply wishing they were trapped. The quicksand of life and dragged almost immediately. <br /> <br />
