Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of the many great documentalists out there. Zak Penn is not good at that either, but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays a little with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always clear in his films, a kind of essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from the Blair Witch Project. Even though I knew it was a fake documentary, you bought totally in the world that the filmmakers created. It seems to the audience that everything is real, although, in the end, you are watching fiction. In other words, it was a fiction disguised successfully as truth. In fact, many early audiences who saw it, at Sundance and other premiere audiences, thought it was real. Penn, whose strong, by his own admission, is screen writing, probably should stick to that. The making of documentary or mockumentary films (and it is difficult to say where one begins and the other ends with this movie) obviously not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he is trying to sell as a legitimate documentary about the filming of a documentary, a kind of meta-documentary. Penn, however, confuses the audience and loses his confidence from the first moment when he enters the house of Herzog before filming Herzog's film, "Enigma of Loch Ness", about the myth of the monster of Loch Ness (a movie which apparently was never over (probably because of Penn's interference). Although Penn is apparently the director of the movie we're watching, he starts looking at the cameras and says, "What's the film crew doing here?" and he starts to get away from them, he does it a couple of other times too, he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, which will force the camera guy to hide in the shadows to capture fragments of dialogues between Herzog and Penn, it seems to be a trick, but that never gets clear, and Penn apparently intentionally keeps us in the dark. "This leaves the audience scratching their heads wondering," Who's in charge here? "If Penn is working against your own film crew, what kind of world are we part of? This is just one of the many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to only enter the fictitious world completely (I think) when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But when the monster makes its first appearance, we have completely abandoned the fictional world that Penn has tried to create, so everything seems silly and useless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating film and a real missed opportunity, since Penn has the opportunity to document a teacher at work, but he completely loses focus and becomes a movie about Penn and his clowning instead of filming a documentary. The presence of Penn begins to permeate and overshadow everything else in the film. <br /> <br /> Herzog's interviews are convincing and we really believe that he is not acting. We even started to wonder if Penn is cheating on him and the other members of his team, in the same way that the public is, but he is never sure of that. Penn, in his interviews to the camera, tries to be extravagant and involuntarily funny, like the characters interviewed in a guest simulation, but he only manages to be annoying. In a Guest movie, this effect is hilarious, whereas here it does not work because you're never sure what Penn is about. As a result, we, the public, began to dislike him as much as apparently the crew. Apart from the beautiful landscapes and the superfluous appearance, from nowhere, from a beautiful model, launched to spice up the film, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming quality (an unintentional one) is that it is a great example of why the audience is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of telling stories, it is doing them a bad service. That's just why I think this would be a good movie to show to film students. a kind of "what not to do" kind of movie. I have nothing against a film told in an unconventional way, as long as it is done with skill, with a thematic base to give substance. This movie is missing completely. <br /> <br /> I'd like to call it a courageous effort for something, but I'm not sure what it is, other than a complete disaster and, ultimately, a waste of time. . <br /> <br /> (As a side note: it seems that bad art always reminds the mind.) This movie made me think of the book "Picture" by Lillian Ross, Ross followed John Huston during the filming of " The Red Badge of Courage "and he documented it brilliantly for the New Yorker - in fact, it would be a great movie - if you want a great example of meta-art, read it.
