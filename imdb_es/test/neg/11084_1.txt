The movie says something like this: running, running, killing someone, a lot of going crazy and then one of the group members shouts "Put it together" or "Just calm down!" Repeat this as many times as the characters are. Among these things, you can enjoy a black and white screen. These are not fast but they last several seconds. I kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened, yes, it happens more than once if you can believe it. <br /> <br /> I noticed that another mentioned "Blair Witch: and it reminded me of that in the way the camera was swollen." However, this movie takes that to the extreme.Every time the characters move the camera is bouncing Sometimes you can not make heads or stories about what you're seeing, it takes us to enlightenment, it's too dark in some areas, I understand they're trying to make us feel like we're in a cave, but Helllloo ... I'm watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see. <br /> <br /> Then there's the ending.In fact, I let out loud: "Are you kidding?" (I was also watching alone.) Dumb, dumb. I think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to surprise us after so much boredom with a so-called "turn." At this point in the movie, you might have seen the "monster" picking up his nose and It would be a disadvantage, a "turn" has happened. You have been warned.
