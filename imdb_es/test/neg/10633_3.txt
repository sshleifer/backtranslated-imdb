I saw this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it amazes the imagination. It's badly built for one, also the script and the acting is just horrible. But even Johnny Depp has a lot of bad movies under his belt. The positive side of this movie would be Amy's singing, and even in that score I think you could have chosen better songs. Amy, of course, is beautiful to watch and if you're a fan of her, you'll probably see this title no matter what happens, but do not expect too much. I wish I had found more than I liked but it was painful to see them. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Duda.
