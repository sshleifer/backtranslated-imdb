Laughable. <br /> <br /> Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Overdose in style to compensate for poor writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV actually used to broadcast music videos and other shows as well. Reality show? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one of those shows? A caricature of the mid-90s? With a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothes. Aeon, played by charming Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a distant and cold rebel who is as skilled as a line dancer and as deadly as a snake viper. It has to be, if you expect to kick the asses of the totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but I hate the sudden influx of films with overdoses of half-futuristic dystopian technology like The Island (2005). ) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the stack). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original to show, so they compensate with the elegant style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. Therefore, the special effects are sensational in Aeon Flux, which allows you to gain some points, but scratch the surface and literally there is nothing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all the performances in this movie are atrocious and some really hurt me to watch. The character of Charlize Theron, Aeon Flux, is interwoven with the most corny character of hard chickens and it seems that director Karyn Kusama can not decide where to go with her. Should I make it more distant or more emotional? She does not know. We're going both ways! Imagine taking a shotgun, the load full of character developments of different types and shoot in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The film Aeon Flux presents all the 'obligatory' ideas in a dystopian society: individual against society, nature against science, emotion against cold reason, etc. You've seen all this before, and better done on that. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even look at Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this cheese feast unconcernedly unprepared for as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
