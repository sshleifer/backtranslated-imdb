I saw the first two nights before arriving at IMDb in search of information about the actor. I saw the rating of 9+ that surprised me since I was not so impressed by what I had seen. (As a reference, I think Lonesome Dove was the best western TV show, I grew up next to the MGM lots in Culver City in the 1950s and I feel some respect for the Western genre). <br /> <br /> So I saw the first brilliant review and decided to read "more". There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summarized my feelings about the lack of development of the character, poor editing, the feeling that had been filmed in the universal lot (MGM is no longer) and the general impression that not It was like this. I'm going to get closer to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than 4.0". <br /> <br /> This made me wonder about the process that produces a rating of more than 9. If people who give years 10 and 9 do not take the time to justify their vote, are the polls full of people with a monetary motivation? For a long time I have used IMDb as a tool to project films and I thought it was the best available. Now I'm not so sure.
