This movie was very disappointing since several elements of the book were poorly made. The main story is the same, but there are several flaws that damage the film. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles is injured at the beginning of the story in a preseason game at Texas Tech. This means he will not achieve anything during the season and Chris Comer appears earlier in the team. <br /> <br /> 2) The game against Marshall was lost in Marshall. The team described as Marshall was actually Midland High, one of Permian's main rivals, and here's the proof: Marshall High is the Mavericks Scarlet and Silver color, Midland High is the Purple and Gold color Bulldogs. Look at the jerseys and you'll see who he is. In addition, the real Marshall High football team is overwhelmingly black, the team shown mixed racially as Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Permian only loses with Midland Lee for a point in the district game. Midland Lee loses with Midland High and Midland High loses with Permian. These are the teams that configured the launch of the coin as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie returns to the team as reserve for Chris Comer and, after not gaining playing time in the Midland Lee game, retires. The team is completely at halftime and never stays on the sideline or goes to any game again. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End, who used # 85, not a Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition, Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) Coaches end up appreciating Chris Eat as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more up, As the staff also prefers, this is partly why Boobie leaves the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at the Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium where UT plays in the state semifinals, not the state finals. Carter wins the state title, but is forced to resign due to an ineligible player. <br /> <br /> The performance is done quite well, but if you read the book, you will see that these failures are quite true. I am also tired of listening to all the PC hypocrites who complain about the representation of the Dallas Carter football team. The equipment according to the book is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the film shows. People say it's a racist representation, but when you read the book, you see a real description of the team. The story is very altered giving this film a score of 3.5 / 10.
