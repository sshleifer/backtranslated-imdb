This movie really sucks, sucks really hard, this movie should be in the bottom of the 100, but it's so bad that almost nobody has seen her vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time that "Hands - the Hands of Destiny " I should have it in position 1 (horrible), but the reason why I put 2 was for Eve, the village girl who, in addition to some scenes of nudity, I thought about voting for 3, but as if they killed Eve I went back to 2. It is that films like this should not be financed by anyone, since they did not even bring fame or other productions to the main actors, great falsehood, haha, the story of a mining ghost that kills "Mansalva" and after put an end to their misdeeds, reappears, because with the end they screwed up very ugly. <br /> <br /> FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful Eva)
