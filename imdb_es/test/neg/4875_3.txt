It's not worth watching this movie, at least not in a movie theater. The story is difficult to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something that happened 3 years earlier). It is difficult to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or it is just so bad / strange that sometimes it seems. Sirens and American lights on the Swedish police cars are just one example. The performance of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as always, but I think that Jenny Lampa acting like Jasmin acts very badly. Zara Zetterqvist acts quite well, she has not been seen as an actress in Swedish films for a long time. If you still want to watch it, wait until it is released on DVD or shown on the television.
