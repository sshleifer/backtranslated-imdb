"Paranormal state" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I enjoy seeing what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, I know that the entire show, along with its developments and story lines are completely set. They go to really enchanted places and I suspect they talk to real witnesses. Normally, when I see it, I feel that I am not watching nonfiction, but a real movie that is contradictory with reality. Personally, I would not recommend or recommend anyone to see this program unless you are a basic scare seeker. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stay with the "ghost hunters"
