Well, this movie could have been good if there was an argument behind it. The title did not even fit after the first ten minutes. The wind did not have much to do with the rest of the movie. the performance was unsatisfactory and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. <br /> <br /> As for horror films, this should not be classified as one. This was a disgrace for fans of horror and thriller everywhere. I hate being so hard, but I felt like I wanted to recover the time I spent watching this movie. Hopefully there is no tracking of this. This film must be enclosed in a vault and never be thrown to the public for viewing.
