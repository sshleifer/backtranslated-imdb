Like the beauty of the jungle, the beautiful smile and the sensual aspect of Jessica Alba loom over the film, but unfortunately they are the only two things that are worth watching this movie for. When in theory we should be attentive to the narrative. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the ground and it's hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she does not add any of the spark she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. From Dark Angel, it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy (but what eye candy!), And is the only reason to put it in movies. <br /> <br /> The dictionary concept for sleeping is silly and boring. implausible, with little development of the character (or character for that matter) that makes us want to undertake the execution time of 109 minutes with this world. Despite the short run time of the films, it still feels too time consuming and too laborious. <br /> <br /> It seems a shame that talents like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer and Bob Hoskins are wasted on a carefree narrative that hardly raises a pulse. This film seriously loses a trick, an exotic stage, a cast more than capable, with a beautiful picture and the opportunity to use the themes and dualistic concepts of "civilization". But there is little narrative to talk about, no drama, no sense that we are seeing a love story, more a story of lust and a woman happy to please men without any doubt. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba freely allowed you to sleep with her, do you seriously think you could concentrate on learning a tribal language? There lies the big problem, both in the suspension of disbelief, as well as what are limited and reduced female characters. Take, for example, the fact that the character of Jessica Alba experiences the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, however, all we see is that she looks lovely and curvaceous a minute, then charming and curvaceous, with one baby, the next. br /> <br /> It is a sad state to see a movie with the promise of not living up to its potential. I could endlessly write the faults of the movies, but it hurts to do so. The film looks good, the premise could have turned into a lovely movie, but unfortunately it was not like that.
