My husband brought this house from the video store, so he could see something while he was stuck at home. The kind of illness where you could never focus on a book, but a kind of silly, light, romantic sounds good (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he had good intentions. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as some others post here too) was that the house MUST be fake ... not only is it isolated on the beach, but it is moored in the loose sand mooring, and so close from the ocean that the waves of the waves go directly below the house! This is so obviously dangerous (in the country of hurricanes, in THE FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure that the filmmakers simply had all the CGI (or used the magic of the movies to put a cute B & B in the surfing). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you, thanks to "teh interwebs", I can say that the house, "Serendipity" is very real, it is very close to Rodanthe and, except for some ornaments and bushes, it appears mostly as He does in the movie. You can rent it yourself, out of season, for $ 1710 per week (or approximately $ 3850 in summer)! Go for it! But ... curiously, the house has serious problems. The second thing that surprised me after I "washed" was "what about the pipes / electricity? In that swell?", And, of course, was condemned to "Serendipity" for an interruption in the sanitation, caused by an overheating of the ocean. . (They are being rebuilt). <br /> <br /> And the house is not from the "Civil War". Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing "clich√© black best friend" (ungrateful role for an excellent actress, last seen in "Doubt"), is not remote enough that her GRANDMA could have built something in the War Civil! HELLO! That was 150 years ago! Try great, great, great! (Actually, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously recently). <br /> <br /> The basic movie is based on the typical cry of Nicholas Sparks, which means a lot of coincidence and foreseeable triviality. It is also very aggressively oriented towards "women": we, women who love B & Bs, antiques and trinkets ... who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Do not give us the plot, or the development of the reflective character; Simply install some mechanisms and activate the love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a patient during routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so she immediately wonders why the surgeon is guilty and not the anesthesiologist. HELLO! Where is that boy? Why does the wrong doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and he's staying at the remote B & B ... who should be there? Why the ONLY PERSON IN THE INN? ... Diane Lane! She is a lonely divorcee, with rotten children and an ex-husband who wants her back. While trying to decide on that, the best black friend of the cliche has her substitute as hostess at the B & B. <br /> <br /> Now, in the real world, if this happened, the doctor would look like this. Ernest Borgnine ... and the lonely divorcee, like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his holidays taking care of 22-year-old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about following a diet. But this is not the real world; I'm digressing. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses everything, falls in love, a hurricane hits ... they make love, they fall in love, he has to leave, he dies and she cries a lot for that. The end. <br /> <br /> There, I saved you from it; Now you do not have to torture yourself or any male acquaintance (spouses, children, boyfriends) to sit on this gut. Very tired <br /> <br /> Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect diminutive woman (whom the filmmakers seem to love to choose) because she is so pretty and thin that most women would want to look like her, but 45 and not exaggerated, so it is not threatening) is constantly covered with large canvas shawls. This would make sense if she was chubby, but she is not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, someone throws a nice Paisley shawl on this movie. So we do not have to see it. Conclusion: read a book, unless you're too sick. If you are too sick, go to sleep.
