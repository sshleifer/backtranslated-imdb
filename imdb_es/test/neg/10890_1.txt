I only comment on very good movies and about total trash. My goal is to help people who want to watch great movies to spend their time and money wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to prevent people from wasting their time in the garbage, and I want to make known the fact that the director / producer of these garbage movies can not get away with it for long. We will discover who you are and we will vote without money - and portfolios. <br /> <br /> This movie clearly falls into the garbage category. <br /> <br /> The director and writer is John Shiban. It is always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. Maybe he wants two paychecks. He should not get any. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else about him, forget it. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot, others have already done it. I'm a little worried about how much the director likes to get close to the poor girl's face when she's crying and screaming. These long-duration shots are a bit disturbing and can say something about Mr. Shiban's mood. Maybe I should get psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough is enough. It sucks, do not waste your time on that.
