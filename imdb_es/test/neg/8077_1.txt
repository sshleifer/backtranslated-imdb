This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. The story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography does not fit the tone of the film, the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do a good job of ruining the rest. People simply do not act that way in real-life situations. My question is: Who would finance such garbage? <br /> <br /> The film begins where some miners fall down the well of a mine after a firefighter does not save them. Next, we join some cyclists in a forest who are doing stunts on their bicycles. A boy falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter arrives to help them. Meanwhile, someone starts a fire. Some more tricks on bicycles. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I lost my time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
