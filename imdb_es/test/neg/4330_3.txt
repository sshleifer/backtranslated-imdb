This movie has an incredible cast. MGM took some of their best actors and starred them in a movie with the generally adorable Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star in three greedy bachelors who live in the same house. While they have amassed a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish idiots. One of them has the idea of ​​donating some property to buy a good name (like Carnegie), but it turns out that the property they want to give away actually belongs to O'Brien. And, as an orphan, they volunteer to be its guardians and thus be able to give away their property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also an absurd secondary plot that involves the fairies, directed by the wonderful character actor. Henry Davenport. And, given that O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her scandalous accent), she and the little people make up a large part of the plot. Frankly, I totally hated this part of the movie and wished I had completely abandoned it. Instead, the story could STILL have been about how sweet Margaret melted the hearts of old men; this would have worked. But ... the "little people"? Sheesh! In general, the actors try hard, but the stupidity of the plot and the way they tried it made me tremble. I noticed that a lot of people liked this movie - I think I'm just a grumpy old man! I found the movie horrible, hard to see.
