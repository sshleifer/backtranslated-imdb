"Eaten Alive" is much easier than "Cannibal Holocaust" by Ruggero Deodato, but it is also a much more foolish film. I mean, sometimes it can be hilarious without wanting to, but the plot is so idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience in the end. The tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) joins Janet Agren (The gates of hell, here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungle of New Guinea for Agren's sister, whom the leader of a religious cult has washed the brain (Ivan Rassimov). On the way, they witness (sometimes real) animal tortures and some cannibalism. As directed by Umberto Lenzi, the film is so exaggerated that it is difficult to take seriously, but if you enjoy the cinema trash with more than a few involuntary laughs, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
