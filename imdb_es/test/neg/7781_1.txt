If you want to waste your time completely, since your idea of ​​a carnival adventure is not the best: remove a lint from your navel or clean the wax from your ears or stack your tiles. br /> <br /> On the one hand, forget the VHS cover. There is NO body in this movie that looks so attractive (that is, the Indian girl). Someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is THE most exciting thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> To put this in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds after the movie, I knew it. I was scammed. <br /> <br /> I ended up seeing it because 1) I paid 99 cents after all and, 2) possibly, possibly a bit of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched bread. <br /> <br /> There was not. <br /> <br /> Good grief, Fonda. I know you were difficult for the roles when you did this, but this is below you.
