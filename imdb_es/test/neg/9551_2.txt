This is one for the Golden Turkey book. It's another of those "put on a show" movies. The dialogue is turgid. The music is terrible. The costumes can be the worst of all. And the choreography of Nick Castle is hilariously terrible. Look at it, oh you who love bad movies. Only Perry Como is tolerable.
