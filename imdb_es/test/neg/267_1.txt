What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought it would ever come to this? A gigantic mess that is half lost and can not be retraced. I was surprised how bad this really was. Really! I have never seen the ending correctly because this movie is simply unbearable. I'm a big fan of the first one, but this is an unconvincing excuse for a sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the theft if they were going to return the money? The movie is just boring and, therefore, I can not sit through this. It really is bad. Just stay that far, repeat, as far as possible from this movie. It's not worth anything.
