The acting was terrible, the cheesy, the fake, the effects of the CHEAP green screen were ridiculous and the creatures were absolutely delayed. The only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laughs that I received when seeing such a bad movie, then I became very angry because I realized that I spent 4 dollars to rent it. Why would a movie like this one be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make any effort to make movies? I'm just writing random things to fill the space, because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should do it. Annnndddddd there!
