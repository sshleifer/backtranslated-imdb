After watching the TV commercials for this movie, I went to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. In the end, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've spent. The Wog Boy did not really provide a story line with enough substance to keep my interest and the predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes did not fill this void. <br /> <br /> A scene in which the two 'Wog Boys' dominate The only track that impressed me was the dance floor of their local nightclub. The only character that was worth seeing was 'Nathan', played by Stephen Curry of The Castle, and his fight with the opposite sex provides most of the few laughs. <br /> <br /> A word for this flic is boring. Save yourself time and just watch the TV commercial while you show the only laughs on it.
