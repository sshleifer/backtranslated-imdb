I wish I had read more reviews and more opinions about this film before renting it. A waste of money. A waste of time. Very little dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The plot and the plot were weak. The only thing that was good was the cinematography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, he will spend so much time trying to resolve things, due to the lack of dialogue, which will rewind the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It was a disaster and it will make you feel like a disaster. <br /> <br /> Say, what the hell was that, when the movie ends?
