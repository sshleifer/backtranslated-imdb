After surfing the Internet, I found the "Homefront" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone got excited, the DVD set I received was recorded by an amateur tape recorder from their television 15 years ago. Resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect the old re-recorded video to be seen. Even though the commercials were edited, the final credits of each episode still have announcements for the segway in the ABC news program "Nightline", complete with the main news headlines of the early 90s. bad image quality, the programs could be seen and the sound quality was good. <br /> <br /> For the credit of this program, the casting was almost perfect. Everyone was believable and it really seemed like the role. His performance was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf plays particularly well Kyle Chandler (seen more recently in the remake of King Kong in 2005). The period costumes were very authentic, as were the sets, especially the kitchens of the 40s with appliances and vintage decoration. The direction was also creative and different for a television program at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes interspersed with conversations about the same subject among other characters in different scenes. The dialogue of the different conversations remained fluid despite the cut and the fourth between the different characters and locations. That requires a good address and editing, and they made it work in this case. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this series again, I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a good show, the story lines and arguments are disappointing and confusing from the start. On the one hand, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When the Second World War ended in 1945, there were no more battles, so obviously there was no longer a "house facade" either. Interestingly, the first episode of the "Homefront" show begins in 1945 after the war was over. That's like filming the first episode of "The Island of Gilligan" that shows how they rescue the shipwrecked. The whole premise of the namesake of the show is completely lost. I still clung to the possibility that the rest of the series is a flashback, but no, the whole show takes place from 1946 to 1948. Also, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately represent the historical events of the end from the 1940s. For the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a vehicle with little veil for an ultra leftist political agenda. The show is located in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the ongoing issue of racism makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr., who play the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil "whites" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if it is not ridiculous. The racism card has been played and played in Hollywood for over 40 years. We understand. We are also tired of having our nose rubbed every day. The issue of racism is also unpopular among viewers and is the kiss of death for any program, as it was for "Homefront". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotyped "frightened / angry black family". The tremendously exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a member of the KKK or something like that. The issue of racism could have been addressed in this program in a single episode with a simple blow to the nose or a fist fight in which a fan receives a well deserved beating, and leaves it at that. Dedicating a large part of the series to the issue of racism becomes really very fast and is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> In another ridiculous plot, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as a character of Ebenezer Scrooge who is against pensions and increases his interest in the trickle of acid in his employees. The workers rebel and take the factory in a blatant pro-Communist propaganda message to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this series had great potential. Writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941? 1945 as suggested by the title and showed the difficulties of food and gas rationing and work of 14 hours a day in the war factories. Of course, the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting abroad would also have added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing special guest stars as military or USO personnel who passed through their city during training or en route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities of good stories and plots are endless. But no, the Homefront writers (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting argument. Instead, they completely missed the point and drifted into a strange and irrelevant obsession with racism and left politics. It would be unfair for the actors to condemn the entire series, but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.
