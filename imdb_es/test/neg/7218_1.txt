The original Road House was a classic movie of the 80s, which, although it did not have a prize or a performance worthy of a prize, was a very funny and popular movie, in large part due to the presence of the star Patrick Swayze and the great distribution. with some excellent fighting scenes and goodies. <br /> <br /> 16 years later, and MGM / Sony tries to recreate the magic that left us all by quoting a line and reciting the three rules of bouncing ... with a movie that quotes the best phrases of the original and recites the three rules. <br /> <br /> If this movie were made by an amateur fan, it would look like a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular films. Like a professional film, it falls directly on his face on the Bargin Bin DVD, with its continuous reuse of lines and the plot of the original film, becoming an annoying sign of lack of originality instead of references to the original. Having said that, with new lines like "I'll kill you like I killed your father," it's no wonder that the writers have decided to repeat much of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew that this was never going to be anything special, being a Direct DVD, but at least I hoped there could be a couple of new ideas and new things included to live up to the name of Road House, but get is simply a remake of the same movie in 2006, with a bit of narcotics added. <br /> <br /> If I were the director, I would have eliminated all references to the first film so as not to stain the original. and its characters. As it is, we have the character of Patrick Swayze who is now supposed to be dead (killed off the screen lamely by Jake Busey) and his brother and son are now the main characters, who strangely have completely different surnames. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was that Dalton's 'son' was driving the same car as his father did, a genuinely great tribute, but later it was ruined by making the car reach its end EXACTLY from the same way his predecessor did. That is a good example of how this film goes too far by including sequences and ideas from the 89 movie. <br /> <br /> Also, of course, who can forget the legendary moment in which Wild Bill promises to kill Shane "like me, he killed his father" and then proceeds to try to dispatch him in a completely different way. Amazing writing there. I see that Schaech appears as a co-screenwriter. Adhere to the performance, or preferably to nothing. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this is a good movie if there is nothing else to see and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half, or if you have not already done so. I did not see the first Road House, but the hardcore fans of the Swayze classic will be totally disappointed to the point of being insulted by the amount of scam this movie is the first. As someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he will not see this one!" Stick to the original Road House and relive the good old days of Swayze!
