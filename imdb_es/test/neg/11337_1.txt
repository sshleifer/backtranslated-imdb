Did you think after "Traumschiff Surprise" that German comedy can not get worse? Can. This comedy is another attempt to perpetuate the stereotypes of masked gay men as a good comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... The real message of the film seems to be how gay men are so different from heterosexual men. . Absolutely stupid, of course. Even gay sex is considered less valuable than direct sex. This movie only tries to serve direct audiences who want to laugh at stereotypical gay men. Well, do not waste your time in German comedy movies!
