This is probably the most uncomfortable movie I've seen. I saw it because I have a weakness for Leon (in my opinion, everything Besson has done has been just horrible, with the exception of Wasabi's script) and Jean Reno. It is a test of how bad this movie is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and affable actors without effort (it is true that he is starting here) can not make this film, nor the moments when he is on the screen. Everything is very school: in black and white, without dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while being chased by an unstable camera. And, as expected, none of that is entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's not a "Mad Mad French" as some people say (actually, I think they mean "Mad Max 2"), it's a superficial comparison. based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic environment, and it's exactly the kind of commentary that is expected from someone who does not know what he's talking about. Mad Max 2 was beating fast, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth it, Le Dernier Combat is none of these. <br /> <br /> I know it's supposed to be great to like the black arty and ... white French films and equally great to say that you saw in them something that other people did not see (or you managed to pass without feeling sleepy), so I would not trust anyone who likes Le Dernier Combat, because you do not see anything worthwhile at all; He asks so much and does not return anything. I found myself drifting after about five minutes and never did anything to get my full attention back. Anyone who can sit without being distracted, is not human, or, at most, is psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to look "cool").
