Yes, a long time ago it became a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. More or less. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with a high school, but there are many guys running around with an orange jumpsuit, so I guess that way it's like a prison. Although not really. When Sasha, the character of Steven Seagal, is admitted to prison, he stands in line and moves to another line so he can talk to his friend, as if he were in line for security control at the airport. Then, in a short time, he and his friend are throwing punches, hitting a couple of security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You add a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second shot. Oh, and there are guys who wear hats and handkerchiefs and all that. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You can not dress like this in most high schools in the United States. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ja Rule, I must say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before watching this movie, I saw one of those TV shows about the best celebrity fights, and how number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the life of a real bully, and Ja Rule. Who had not done it. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, all I could imagine was 50 Cent laughing at his ass. Every time he appears on the screen, Ja Rule looks like a 9-year-old troublemaker. <br /> <br /> Anyway, go back to the plot. It is funny. Sasha is an FBI agent who works undercover and he agrees to be sentenced to prison in order to be behind the criminal organization. He was sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity disappears instantly. Nothing else in the film matters after that, it becomes a string of meaningless action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. <br /> <br /> Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes into the "New Alcatraz" roof at any given moment, accidentally releasing all inmates. And what do they do? Everyone leaves their cells and plays basketball in the middle of the block of cells. Without as much as a basket. They had a ball, but that does not matter. The scene is so stupid that they could have been playing hopscotch. <br /> <br /> Therefore, a man is being sentenced to be the first person executed in the state of the Alcatraz enforcement chamber, evidently not for stealing $ 200 million dollars in gold, but not to say where he was hiding once he got caught. <br /> <br /> Hello, good thoughts, people. If you can not get information from someone, kill them. That is a great way to learn the truth! So some gangs enter the prison planning to stop the execution and obtain the location of the $ 200 million for themselves. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the $ 200 million is in bricks of gold. I doubt they realized how difficult it would be to turn that into a bargaining chip. <br /> <br /> There is also the problem of the prison director. It's a hard-talking guy who thinks he's a neighborhood color, who reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once he talked about people in California who talk about all the difficult things, calling themselves houses and that kind of nonsense and all kinds of similar nonsense. These people go to Mexico, says the comedian, and they say: "Oh, my God, people live there, it's like a total hut!" <br /> <br /> The best thing is when the Supreme Court of the United States Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can not carry their weapons inside their prison, "I do not care if she is a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States! " <br /> <br /> This woman could crush him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, the Supreme Court judge who is taken hostage in the film tells the villain he is 53 years old. It's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is being slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for the company that produced this movie (and that's why I saw it), and I still have nothing positive to say about it, except, of course, for that scene with Ja Rule being whipped for that Asian woman. <br /> <br /> So read my review of Malena and she will. see how sometimes I disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this film, Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he wrote: <br /> <br / > "I imagine the flyers" in the MPAA congratulating each other for a good day's work, since they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun film 'Bowling for Columbine' an R. " <br /> <br /> The way to go guys
