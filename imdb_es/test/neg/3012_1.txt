This show is pathetic. I can not even begin to imagine how someone with an IQ greater than that of a split pea soup that has already passed its expiration date can go through this garbage for a full half hour. It is one of those rare programs that is so horrible in all aspects that, honestly, you can say that you are less intelligent simply by seeing it. I did a study and found out that the average person loses 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they see this program. That's only surpassed by another abortion of Comedy Network, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and practically a draw with Girls Will Be Girls. The VIP keys owe each and every one of us an apology. Every time I see this parody of a show, I feel sad for society. How is it allowed to continue?
