First of all, the nature of the film is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked like Mongols and camels, but that's all that was Mongolian. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, although a scant performance. But she is beautiful, which redeems a little the lack of performance on your part. <br /> <br /> But, I could not understand what this fantasy piece of 1.30 hours created by Doloroso was for. Mr. Bodrov. The plot totally lacked a sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was almost no story at all, just a series of scenes little linked to a group of boys dressed in "Mongolian" clothes, who spoke a bit of tone that is supposed to sound like Mongolian. Most of the actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were filmed in China, Kazakhstan or Russia and there were many disturbing comments about what it is like to be a "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the scenes with dialogue are slow. The battle scenes are laughable. All the supernatural pathos is scarce and, obviously, is there only to compensate for the lack of history. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him, he has no idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He seemed drowsy, soft, stiff and pitiful for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> And I do not even want to start with the issue of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. Seeing Chinggis-khan half the film as a slave, seeing his first two sons being born of other men, seeing his wife selling himself to the Tangut merchant ... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? One could make a great movie about it. Where is the story of Temujin's rise? From his childhood, from his relationship with his family, from his brothers, from how he struggled to survive among the powerful enemies of his family? Where is Van Khan, who helped him a lot? Where is the representation of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relations with the other nations that surround them? <br /> <br /> Where is the development of the characters? We totally failed to see what reunited Temujin with Jamukha and what separated them and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast without wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongol tribes and create such an organization an effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we did not see any of that in Bodrov's creation, not even a glance.
