This has an interesting way to handle a camera, <br /> <br /> especially for a DTV movie - the version I saw was in full screen <br /> <br /> - but it falls short in the department of scenarios. First you get <br /> <br /> around 20 million talks, talks, talks in a post-style "Trainspotting", then it's the city of Slasher. And then comes <br /> <br /> the most dishonest trick I've seen, much worse than <br /> <br /> "April Fool's Day", where it at least made sense. So, everything in <br /> <br /> everything, is the old song and dance: the interesting director tries hard, but he deserves a better movie. Funny: generally, are the actors who desperately need <br /> <br /> something better ?? Skip anyway, for your time.
