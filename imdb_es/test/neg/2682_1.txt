Well, wait, let me enter this street, there are actually some idiots on this site who consider this to be one of the best, if not the best, Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was as good as the original. Pah, what nonsense do not believe them. I've seen every Halloween and, unlike some people, know what makes at least one good horror movie and this S rain is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Frankly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the person who wrote this or go home with a hunting rifle. Seriously, the aftermath of Halloween in general are almost all garbage, two were garbage, three were stupid, four are fine, five are fine five, H20 is fine, painful Resurrection. However, in many ways, I consider this to be the worst of a lot of very bad sequels. Why? Well, let me embark on a kind of peroration, not so much a review but a rant about why Halloween 6 The Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies I've seen in a long time. OK, where should I start, ah, yes, the plot, oh, boy, the plot. Basically, the plot is a mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It's really stupid what it really is, the movie tries to be flashy and intelligent, but it's piled up in a way so horribly done. Why does Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? Pretty simple explanation. Micahel likes to kill his relatives, that would be enough, but no, we have to have a man with black and mysterious cults, and signs of Thor and total shit. God is so bad that it made me want to cry because he really did, the writers have tried to add something to the character of Myers, but in reality they have managed to do the opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit <which is a completely different color by the way, Myers is simply not the same type of the original or even two, maybe even four. That's another thing, why has Myers become a parody of Jason Voorhes? I thought it was meant to be the other way around, however, Myers is very similar to Jason, all he does is kill people bloody. In the original he mocked that his victims took their time and, as a result, everything was much more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people. I mean, in the half hour space that we had equaled the number of deaths in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh, and Myers in this seems to have a very big head, I mean it's huge and that puts on a lot of weight. What else is shit, oh yes, the return of Tommy Jarvis, that's pretty bad, in fact, all the characters in this movie are, of course, Dr. Loomis. I can not stand the child, I wish I had understood, it's really irritating. Our heroine is boring and not interesting. And his whole family is a terrible group of actors. The mother is trash, the brother is bad and the father, I mean, was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for the love of God. Actually, he was more evil than Myers. By the way, his death is one of the most abysmal I've seen, I think even on Friday the 13th there would not be something so ridiculous. What else is garbage? Oh, yes, Tommy Jarvis, I do not know the man's name, but he really can not act, he does everything he can to be serious and all that, but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish I had died, in fact, if everyone had died, I would have been pretty good indeed. There's Dr. Loom, a Donald Pleasence horribly aged and dying everywhere. Despite being on his last legs, Pleasance continues to stand out in the short amount of time it counts. It is a pity that a cornerstone of this franchise has had to say goodbye in this way. What else is garbage? Oh, yes, the part where the radio DJ gets it. First of all, how the hell did Michael get into that van when he was at his house five minutes ago? In the second place, it was only a meaningless death that can increase the count of corpses, but it is just another of the nonsense that adds to the foolishness of this movie. In fact, it's death that said it all for me, since it did not make much sense for this movie.
