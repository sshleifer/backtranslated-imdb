I guess the favorable comments on this page come from people who have never read the book. Unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood overcame itself by destroying this one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure. Where did the woman's love interest come from, except that she replaced the cat, or why did our Rogue Male acquire a useful family in Blighty? In fact, the vast majority of the book has been clipped and replaced by its standard rude love. history. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was completely eliminated and our Rogue received a name (none of them appeared until the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. Joan Bennett beats Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins for miles and this is a small way to save him. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, the British should probably avoid this. Trust me :)
