Fred Williamson, one of the two or three main stars of blaxploitation. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three leading female action stars in the United States. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine the movie THE WORST that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this film was made in 1997 and both went from their best, but that does not mean they did not have what they needed, they only needed the help of good writing and a good address. They do not even have here. Rothrock can throw a couple of kicks near the end, but this movie is so atrocious that you probably will not be awake to see them. (*)
