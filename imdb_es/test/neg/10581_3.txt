Here is a parody that is guaranteed to entertain people in the IQ range of Homer Simpson. It's a cheap shot to all the great superheroes, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it does not end there; It progressively worsens until it disintegrates into a pathetic set of stick trollops by the truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in the plot, you only have to watch Spiderman under the influence of a heavy narcotic. What you get is Dragonfly Man? A wonder boy, who loves the girl next door, suddenly inheriting super super powers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but do not do it. 'Take my word for it! For children, this is fun; for adults it is a great movie to leave the children.
