There is a lot of ketchup, but not much sense in the third continuation, supposedly explanatory, that accumulates in the visual effects naff without any effect. The good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which Pinhead terrifies Pinhead (Doug Bradley, expelled from mothballs for the umpteenth time), in which they terrify several members of the same family (all of them, interpreted deficiently by Bruce Ramsay) . Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches, but he does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a dish of the sick. The incoherent plot does not manage to adequately fill the short execution time of the film, although this may have more to do with the interference in the studio than any other intention of the filmmakers.
