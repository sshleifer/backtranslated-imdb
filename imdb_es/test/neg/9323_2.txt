I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite movies. But some fans of the horror movies were in a premature racket when their original version of the prequel EXORCIST (DOMINION, this is the one you are reading at the moment) was dismissed by Warners, and when Renny Harlin was replaced by fir stuff. Upload and create a new version that was "more terrifying". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and automatically became judgmental about hating Renny Harlin's take on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) even before the first frame of the movie was so easy to play. And I should know; because I myself went to the theatrical premiere of START with stubborn arms crossed, and prepared for the worst of the absolute, I was sure I had to come. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Harlin's BEGINNING was much more serious than he could ever have conceived, with Stellan Skarsgard performing well as a young version of Father Merrin, who was struggling with his faith in God. It was not a great movie in any way, but it was not even close to the garbage I had prepared for, well in advance, unseen. <br /> <br /> Well, now I have finally seen the true trash version. - and it is the DOMAIN of Paul Schrader: PREPARING THE EXORCIST. It was implacably trivial, uninteresting and insipid. The priest with Stellan Skarsgard's problems was not as interesting as it had been for me in the Harlin movie, and the actor himself is not so good on paper. For all those who pointed out the obvious CGI effects in START, guess what? They are also here in DOMINION. Do you remember the stupid ending of Harlin's performance (which I also agree with the rest of the movie)? Well, you will find that this Schrader ending is not much less lame. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I am annoyed by the foolishness of those who appreciate this film. It's better than Harlin, saying that we are "delays" or "we can not appreciate the subtle cinema". As a person who despises Stephen Sommers' 99 MUMMY, and that I am a true fan of the very suggestive and discrete old horror films of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not the case with me. At least there was "a certain degree of terror and exorcist-type events at Harlin's BEGINNING; This here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified insomniacs. It's going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans trying to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUELING THE EXORTIST was as good as they had already decided that it would be done in advance; Just when they were already predisposed to criticize Harlin's BEGINNING at the time they learned that the name of Paul Schrader was soaked with the White-Out.
