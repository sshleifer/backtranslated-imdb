I can not believe how bad this "movie" is. To begin with, the film is about the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising outlook. Unfortunately, that is as interesting as it gets. This looks like a direct DVD release ... or so I think. This is basically a matter without production, probably with the worst edition (with a constant "fading to black" between all the scenes!) I have seen in my life and the performance that will surely make you tremble. Why Lance Henriksen chose this is completely unfathomable. And the film takes tracks from almost every other film genre, from "Blair Witch Project" (The video scene) and "Predator" to "Alive". This supposedly is based on real events, but the only truth that is found here is how bad this movie is. I'm usually not a harsh critic and believe me, I tried to enjoy this crap but I finally did NOT do it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this DVD. <br /> <br /> I will try to put it gently: this movie is PURE trash and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask for a refund to BLOCKBUSTER. <br /> <br /> And Lance, what a shame! 1 * out of 10 *
