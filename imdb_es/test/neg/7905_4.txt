This movie was not very funny. It was not too horrible either. Just a fun ride aboard the Soul Plane. It is a black property flight service with a disco, a beautiful bar and pumping managers. The plot takes you through the idea of ​​a black plane (not of race or color, but of "style") with the same style of black humor. Sometimes, there are some cool weird scenes like when the main character uses the "normal" sink in the "normal" plane. Check it out. However, there are moments of calm, and I find it more in the character who played the soul pilot. Look to know who he is. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold joins the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is a movie to watch when you play poker, when you're drunk or you're just going crazy.
