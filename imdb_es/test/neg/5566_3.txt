The actresses are pretty and the sets, although simple, pretty good. Apart from this, there is nothing to save from this movie. Incredibly badly performed, dialogues between fools and tears, too much expected plots, many mistakes and inconsistencies (for example, a pretty girl receives blows to the head by a morning star and not only survives, but just with a scratch!). .. so that it is short because it is not worth more, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
