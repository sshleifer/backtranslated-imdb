I had never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad that I had no choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid World War II historian, I do not even know where to start about how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbine with bayonet ears from the Korean War, missing reeds and K98k cleaning bells, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could go on forever. He added that it is loaded with defects, literally has no argument or climax, and acts on par with the theater of his local high school. The epitome of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good films from World War II to waste your time on this garbage.
