Although the embryo could have been an examination of bioethics that can provoke reflection, it degenerates into a stereotyped parable of Frankenstein, explaining the monotonous lesson that there were some kingdoms in which man should not enter or study. Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent aborted babies from dying. After succeeding with a dog, it immediately launches humans, violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility, with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. Your experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and part of the training of the animals is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastic. Although a message in the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the scientific work presented seems unreal even in the 21st century, much less in the mid-seventies. In addition, the scene in which Carrera can find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering by simply writing a question on a computer is ridiculous.
