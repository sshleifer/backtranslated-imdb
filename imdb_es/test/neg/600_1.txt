This film is basically a poor version of the old urban legend of the nanny who receives unstable calls that tell her to check the children, calls the police who track the calls and finds them from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simple that a small child could have written it. There's not much suspense, it's clear that the killer is halfway through the movie. At first, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. What's up with that? The movie is as typical of slashers with an original storyline as a Beatles concert. Even by the low budget slasher standards it is cheesy. Do not waste your time with this. nuff said
