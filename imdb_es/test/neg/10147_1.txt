Now I have seen everything. Just when I thought I could not be more pathetic and cheesy than "Woodchipper Massacre," just when I thought dialogue and acting could not be worse than "Nail Gun Massacre," just when I thought "Do not Go In The Woods" I would keep his title as Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, and then "THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY!" appears in some way, this cheap and miserable manure manages to avoid lasciviousness, but it's still terrible! I could not believe what I saw, for once, I can not complain about excessive nudity (or in this case, anybody) in a slasher movie, but even so it got me angered by embarrassment to rent it. I've never seen such a horrible performance before, dialect, direction, writing ... I could go on forever with this list! Here is a quick summary: <br /> <br /> A mental patient somehow escapes from the asylum, dresses like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and goes while the doctor's daughter has friends. at night. Then the most stupid wave of murders begins (scammed from other movies like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween ") on this side of the universe, the characters have a negative IQ, which suggests they are not human. yes, no, since they have the tendency to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, since the slasher likes to show their use when he raises his protector to the camera in too many scenes, it's only 80 minutes ... how many times Should we look at that model before it consumes the whole movie? ... which, I suppose, would not be such a bad idea in this case.There is a time when I thought maybe, just maybe, the director would do it. make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas, it was not going to be! And then, to insult even more, there is a stupid sub-final of super-oversight and a final conclusion even more stupid.That probably does not have much sense, but I would hate to give the few scenes Fools of movie history to those two or th. Fools ree (like me) foolish enough to rent these sewage. <br /> <br /> I hope that by writing this, I have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I get on my knees and beg anyone who is still thinking about renting this: PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT DO IT! This is a fan of the slasher genre speaking; I know what is good for you! The only real victims in this stupid, absurd and senseless are the poor idiots who have sat around the toilet tank! The scoring of Zanatos ... since there is not a scale of negative points, I have to give it a 1, but a 1 below the average. Avoid it at all costs .... please!
