Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we are talking about snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value, no budget, no gore, Z-grade actors, etc., this movie was a terrible addition to the film industry of terror and should not have been done !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew that Linnea Quigley was in it, and of course, she makes her obligatory nude shower scene, which is lovely, yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the film itself ... ...... I fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire to finish it, it's very bad. OKAY. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I'm an avid fan, I'm a MASSIVE fan, I love low-budget horrors, I love everything, but I hate this crap, so I think that will tell you everything what you need to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give you this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a total ZERO !!!!
