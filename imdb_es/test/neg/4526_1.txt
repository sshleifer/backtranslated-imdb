Do not believe in the hype. If you have high hopes or anticipated this movie to some degree, you may feel disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can not save this stupidly written and poorly written spy movie. For purists (fans of the original television series), this film has little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except for their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is something more than a bad shadow of the TV version. For those who are not familiar with the original TV series, you may not feel disappointed, but you are likely to get bored. There are also some cheap Hollywood political shots (really pathetic and so typical for an election year). We left after the first hour and we were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
