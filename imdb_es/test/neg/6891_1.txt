This movie was so predictable and badly performed. I really can not recommend it to anyone, not even for involuntary laughter. It is simply bad. It is pure hell of movies for television, the cast does not seem so bad, but they act terribly. Just stay away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.
