It is a terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful, since all aspects are terrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of the best actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are completely wasted, and although they give good performances, one wonders why annoying Mark Kasdan's script is a complete disaster, and Martin Campbell It has the narrative jumping everywhere, but if you can not follow it, take it as a blessing. There are too many crazy and meaningless scenes that just do not make sense. The music of Jerry Goldsmith is not much help either. <br /> <br /> Even if there was potential in the plot, director Campbell's approach has ruined it completely. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
