Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of a movie: a good story. The characters are not very original and are not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role he has played in recent years and repeated in "Festen". It seems as if he thinks that acting is being angry and screaming at other people! The film does not make much sense and is not very funny, although it tries to be "crazy" and "weird". If you are going to do a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?
