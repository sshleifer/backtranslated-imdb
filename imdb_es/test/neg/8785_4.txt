Whoa I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, when I was eight again, in 1996. Back then, CGI movies were a rarity; And the good ones even more. Also, back then we were listening to things called CD players. But I digress. Before I liked this movie a lot, since then, and until I see it again, I have fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. But, again, I'm rambling. <br /> <br /> Then, I saw it again. This really is not one of your best, I can say now, eleven years later. I have seen many more movies and I have gained a little more knowledge. Now, of course, the voice acting is good, I'll give you that. The story ... it's fine. I mean, we see it all the time. MUCH. But it works. The musical numbers are what irritate me. This would have been more at home in the eighties, with this kind of musical numbers. In '96, most children's films had epic numbers, like the Lion King (which came out a year earlier, but whatever) or things like that. Here you have show songs, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> The animation also hurts. Sometimes, choppy, and in others, completely changing the style and format with the change of a shot, it is very difficult not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All dogs go to heaven, but this could have been waaay better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
