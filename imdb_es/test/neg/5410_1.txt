My wife and I enjoyed bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of those. That was bad but it had some redeeming qualities. It makes you wonder how an actor who respects himself approaches lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> This is so bad that now it has taken its place as our standard for evil. It's not just a bad movie, it really sucks. There was the mixed attack force, the "Indian" riding in a black cape and using a SWORD to shout aloud. He knocked down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points where it did not rise above the pitiful. We could not find any redemption features except one. Those were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no development of the character, no point in the movie. Someone in Hollywood needs to be fired.
