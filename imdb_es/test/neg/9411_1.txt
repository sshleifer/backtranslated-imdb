Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director could convince his cast with his empty story that does not tell us anything new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature student". The characters are not even interesting or friendly. Artistically it is so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be attractive. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character without success. Pity because sports betting can be a really interesting topic that many could relate to. But I can not have a full commentary on this movie, since I left the theater 20 minutes before finishing. Everything was so predictable that it was a waste of time ...
