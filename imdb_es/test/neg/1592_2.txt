The only reason I have not given this film a horrible rating is because I feel it was such a horrible movie in all aspects that it deserves at least a 2/10; for not trying. <br /> <br /> The plot is the least of your worries, as they hit you in the face with superior language and scenes like 'the hole in the ass that sings' in a poor attempt to shock and dislike. Seen as the main objective of this film is to impact and the main body of it did not achieve this, the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this surprisingly useless film and fulfill its goal of being the dirtiest movie in history. Br /> <br /> A very low budget movie, very badly performed and the dialogue is surprisingly bad. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10 really!
