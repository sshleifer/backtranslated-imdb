This movie made me so angry! Here I am thinking that here is a new horror movie, one with a sense of intelligence and then the movie starts. The landscape, the delivery of lines, the disguises, the fake gore, should I follow? There are porn movies with better dialogue than this. I understand the concept behind the indie movies, but by God, this was not just indie, it was a high school book report filmed with a camcorder and the cast are all friends and family. This is a movie that was condemned from the beginning. Maybe if it were 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly. But it seems to me that someone hung a rock around the neck of this albatross and was sinking at a constant speed.
