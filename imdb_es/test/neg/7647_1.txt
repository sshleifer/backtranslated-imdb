Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies I've seen in my life. It looked like a movie made for television. And a bad one in that. I can not believe that people continue to hire Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing John Sayles to make films. One night, my husband and I met this movie on TV and got so bored that we ended up cleaning the house while it was on. . . And it continues to bore us! It made me think that the critics have been so gullible with Sayles' previous films, such as Lone Star, which they praised at the time, but did not contribute much in the end. Spend your time in something better. Anything.
