Well, I have to agree with the critics in this case, that everyone said "leave him alone". Why did they have to make this new version of 1960 "Psycho", I do not know. I guess they wanted to reach a new audience and color and modern actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialogue was the same and the history was the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I applaud you for not having finished this with a lot of blasphemy and nudity and making it a poor quality movie. However, if they were to keep everything the same, why bother when you were not going to get better with Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did they honestly believe that Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche, with her short male haircut, is going to be better than Leigh? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were nice here, but it's the black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so spooky to begin with. It's perfect for the story, not a lot of greens and roses! Once again, I suppose the filmmakers bet on an audience that never saw the original. <br /> <br /> This was just a stupid project that should never have taken off.
