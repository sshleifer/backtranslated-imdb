A clumsy young man returns to the west after being educated in the hotel business through Boston; he quickly learns that his friends in the old California colonized by the Spaniards expect him to fill the shoes of his late father: that of a romantic thief known for kissing his victims after stealing them. The colorful and silly production of M-G-M has a lot of talent before and behind the camera, but it never takes off. This could have been fun, second-string material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra seems lost and embarrassed in the lead. The combination of outrageous comedy and musical interludes is hampered by the mise-en-scene (Sinatra is photographed singing in a moment in a mirror, but one does not focus as much on his performance as on realizing how strange the star reflected in this way!) Kathryn Grayson is the daughter of the Governor who falls in love with Frank, and her soprano trinaje makes her singing scenes become self-parody. Apart from the cinematography of Robert Surtees and the decent artistic direction, this "Bandido" remains without a kiss. * since ****
