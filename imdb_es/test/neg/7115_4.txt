Just an hour ago I finished seeing this my friend. As fans of Dragonball, we think that this movie is so bad that it is good. We will say one thing: without sixpack beers, now there is a way to survive through this movie. This movie must be seen with many Dragonball fans to laugh at. The best character in the film is Mr. Horn, his makeup, his laughter and his behavior create the unforgettable experience. What we liked in this movie, was the fact that the island of Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character similar to that of the caricature is the Turtle Man. He is also a sexual maniac and also a kind of idiot.
