You have to give it to writer and director John Hughes. With a huge success behind his back in the maladjusted / adolescent vein, he managed to extend to other areas of comedy, finding in the negotiation a great ally in the comedian and actor John Candy. Here, Candy, a dumb adult, becomes a better person after agreeing to take care of her brother's children; It is a safe formula designed to please both cynical teenagers and their parents, and it is not surprising that the film was a winner among the theatrical audience. Even so, Hughes relies almost completely on Candy's charm to get over the stage, and one can get tired of repeated gags with the front and center of the star. The children are comedians, the other adults without form, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too exaggerated to play Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later it became a television series, which is appropriate since the material was already perfected for television. * 1/2 of ****
