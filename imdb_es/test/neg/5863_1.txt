This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life: it has no good feature. <br /> <br /> It seemed like it was done in about 20 minutes with the other time full of title graphics. <Br /> <br /> The leader man was transformed from the door of death to Superman. I felt cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I could not recommend this movie to anyone
