Oh, another movie with motorcycles, the gang of the angels of hell and Steve A-Lame-o as the driver not so great. This movie is not based on history, but on a lot of drinking, smoking marijuana and many stupid acts. Steve's interpretation of a dying cat during his "I love what I know" serenade made me vomit for hours. Cute girl on a bicycle (rrrr) does with everyone! Fats did the best performance since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also encourage you to try to understand what Banjo says. "You are playing with private actions." This is people writing screenplays. <br /> <br /> I liked the ending. What better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! You have to see this to detest it. <br /> <br /> DIE Jeter, DIE !!!
