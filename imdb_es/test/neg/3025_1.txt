Good sir. <br /> <br /> I'm going to say from the beginning, I only saw 20 minutes of this movie. As I am a Eraserhead fan, the "what, can not you see a strange black and white movie with little or no dialogue?" The defense does not apply. I just can not watch TERRIBLE rare black and white movies with little or no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens when you give an agonizing gothic child without talent and nothing to say a camera. and budget, and let him / her put on the screen as many senseless offensive images as possible. It was clear from the beginning that this movie should have lasted 5 minutes (assuming it should exist). The shots that should last a few seconds are prolonged for minutes, because the director has the syndrome "I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Own-Voice", and refuses to make another shot until the piece of Filming is complete. It has been seen. From the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating with the corpse of "God" (the opening scene of the movie! Happiness!), I knew it was only a matter of time until I turned off the tape. After at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled, with a rope, by a gang of mysterious men in disguise, I knew it was time to surrender. I rarely surrender in a movie. I sat through the whole of Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, though not happily. This did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave him. <br /> <br /> If you are a Eraserhead fan, DO NOT let simple comparisons with that film help you rent this piece of amateur garbage. Let me refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for an incoherent piece of black and white rarity that can be seen and enjoyed.
