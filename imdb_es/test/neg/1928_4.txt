.. that separate good and memorable films from movies like this one. It is not entertaining, touching, fun, interesting and, at times, it feels a bit subhuman. The directors act as if they were from another world, in the worst way, when they are supposed to relate to each other and to the public. <br /> <br /> It starts conventionally enough. The rich kid gets a new car for graduation, but the dean says he can not have the car until after the ceremony. In spite of everything, keep enjoying and stop at the restaurant on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick discussion with the local yokels. Wise-asses the waitress / girlfriend of the yokel head. Surprisingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn the restaurant they left three minutes earlier (are not all diners five feet from the gas station?). <br /> <br /> They said they had to pay the price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of the water' to stay in the city is to devise the scenario in which both children have to help in the reconstruction of the diner. Worse than that, the child rich in staying with the family of the child not rich ... in the room on the attic. That 'room over the attic' has rescued many people who need a bed ... <br /> <br /> The rich child, inexplicably, is treated well by the bride, who never mentions that he almost killed her. This does not bode well, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. You do not know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls in love with Kelley (Chris Klein), or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee completely intolerable and Josh does not register much impression. The character with more life is the judge who condemns Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. She gets at least one funny comment, which is more than anyone. Everyone is so grumpy and humorless that you will feel a little silly if you think about smiling while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The ending is a way to finish the piece, not the most original, but at least it was finished. I do not enjoy tearing apart a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world really loves, but since I'm not one, I have to do it. The best I can say about this movie is that it is not petty and, although it does not manage to compel, its innocence and its home, the corny dialogue comes from a nice place. 4/10.
