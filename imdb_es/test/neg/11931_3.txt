Joan Crawford is convincingly disfigured when our story begins and, of course, it gets fixed. But she is a bad egg, exploiting a man, while living the antisocial philosophy of another. All this takes place in Sweden, which is really strange. Cause anything and everything memorable in the visuals, which is free of having to represent Anytown USA, but makes the viewer wonder why each remake, since it is overloaded and is not specific for the need to Americanize everything. There is a plot, a plot, a plot so talkative that it could drown in it, and to make things worse is a framing device that adds brightness to the film. Photography is occasionally nice, with strange angles and miniatures built in pretty well. But it is overloaded without having attracted you once.
