Honestly, this may be the worst movie I've seen. And I've seen Spider Baby, and not this Earth. Heck, I've even seen 200 motels. Having discovered the series of Freaks and Geeks and surprised by the acting ability of Linda Cardellini, I reviewed the reviews here and decided it was worth a try. That is the LAST time that I will trust a revision in IMDb. I did not realize that MORONS was writing critiques of IMDb while they waited for their calls to be answered on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that mere words can not express the misery of its state of vomit. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really funny, if you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Watch this movie, but PLEASE DO NOT BREAK!
