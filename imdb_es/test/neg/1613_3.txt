This film takes the plot behind the sci-fi movie "Doppelganger" (an astronaut of our Earth who crashes into an 'against-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the totalitarian vibrations of the Cold War in that world) and tries to turn On a pilot for a television series. However, everything sank without a trace, and television is likely to be better. <br /> <br /> All present are perfectly adequate in a form "made for television". Cameron Mitchell fulfills his solid habitual performance. The same goes for Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of John Saxon, a poor man) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence represents a threat to the foundations of the "World Order" on Earth. <br /> <br /> But low budget and low energy and inconsistent scripts and lack of real imagination in the designs and cinematography keep this science fiction adventure firmly attached to the launch pad. <br /> <br /> I'll give an example: in the original template for this pilot, ("Doppleganger"), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and collide their ship in a truly frightening sequence (It was obvious that his ship would never fly again). Then, the two astronauts wobble helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the midst of heavy rains and winds, only to be knocked down and defeated by faceless men shouting through loudspeakers. <br /> <br /> In "Stranded in Space", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when the buzzers sound, things start to shake and the camera vanishes in a blackout (and as one friend pointed out, it was quite obvious that the actors were simply shaking in their seats, the director was not even shaking the camera or the device). I have seen episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that required more effort to establish the mood and atmosphere that this mediocrity made for television. <br /> <br /> And that, in essence, is what is wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just making symbolic gestures and hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of the science fiction Fan Boys fill the rest. I'm sorry, guys, it did not work. <br /> <br /> I am sure that everyone here is finishing their work in this and they walked away, and they never thought about it again, except as a list in their C.V. And that's what you, the spectator, will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you ever saw a television movie called "Stranded In Space," but it did not make a lasting impression on you, and you can not remember too much about it.
