I was surprised by director Antal's Kontroll in 2003. His first project in the United States, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is its second feature and although the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the cast of actors with quality actors should be able to offer. Antal could have made a great movie of theft, but instead goes for an action movie. On the other hand, I could have made a good action movie, but it does not really work in that department either. <br /> <br /> What you have left is an unlikely situation after another, a group of badly drawn characters fight over a sum of money. If you look beyond the clear cinematography, the cast and the tight music, you get what could have been a live video below average with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.
