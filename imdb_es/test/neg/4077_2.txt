I mean, I went to this movie with my expectations too high. I thought it was going to be fun because it's the sequel to Bruce Almighty, which is really funny and stars Steve Carell, who is an excellent comic actor, but hey, he stunk. <br /> <br /> The film is announced as a sequel, but in reality it has nothing to do with the original, since the only people who repeat their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but the character of Steve is completely different, he is not the imbecile who was in the first one, he's a good guy. . The story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very bad cameo)) have talent, but none of them seems to use it and it seems that There is in the movie just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now, the plot obviously has shape after Noah's story, but there are many wrong things in it. , I do not know where to start I guess the big problem is that everyone around Evan thinks he's crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, receives help from animals from all over the world, build a giant arch in a few weeks, in real life people would not make fun of these guys after that, they would say it's the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also the special effects are good, but what the hell? Is it the biggest movie ever filmed in Evan Almighty? Did you really have to waste such good special effects as stuffing for this fucking movie? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy, as he has stayed away from three of the worst sequels ever made, Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a big disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
