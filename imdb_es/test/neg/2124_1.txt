There really is not much to say about this. It is really very, very bad. The acting is bad, the script is bad and the editing is probably one of the worst works in history. It is so careless and choppy that it only serves to confuse the audience. There is no real plan to talk about, mostly a really fake monster fish that attacks Europeans trying to pass themselves off as Americans. Pass on this.
