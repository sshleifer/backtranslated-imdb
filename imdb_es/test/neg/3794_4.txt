I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere of it, in the small cinema of the Triskel Arts Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found that "Strange Fruit" is an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low-budget movie that's expected! In general, the performance (particularly of Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and the direction are excellent, and the script is extremely entertaining and stimulating, with some nice configurations and an ingenious dialogue. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit sudden, without a conclusion being given to the characters and events once the ending came to an end ... but maybe that's what the filmmakers were looking for . It certainly made the movie more disturbing. I liked the fact that the main character never reached an agreement with his mother on the screen: it leaves you wondering if he will ever do it, since in real life sometimes these things are never resolved. This was a good option, to leave it unresolved instead of sentimentally wrapped! <br /> <br /> Intense and suspenseful, "Strange Fruit" is a hugely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what writer / director Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He and his colleagues are a talent worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I hope "Strange Fruit" has a wider release soon, as more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with something original and insightful twists about homophobia and racism in the South of the United States. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
