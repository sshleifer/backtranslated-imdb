THE EXPERT, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Dull, characters, boring situations, boring direction, boring actors, boring cinematography, boring music. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wants to be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below his average television drama. And there are some typical scenes of "Speakman pummeling bad guys" here and there, but the main aspect of the film is based on some kind of credible drama, which is totally incorrect for Speakman or is so misdirected that it just does not work with the star of action In the end, this confusing movie looks and feels very anodyne and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is music. The composer is an aspiring Jerry Goldsmith, with his pompous and melodramatic punctuation, which simply does not belong to this type of film (boring). It is as if the producers knew they had a very boring product in their hands and asked the composer to make the film feel more attractive and dramatic with his score, which makes the whole film look even more confused, awkward and boring. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this, even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.
