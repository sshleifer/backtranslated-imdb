Stay away from this movie. The fact that you are reading reviews tells me that perhaps you have already been corrupted by the horrible situation that it entails. This is a truly horrible movie ... so let's go to the problems. Writing and direction: I would not be surprised if they were managed by a group of senior students who were watching "scream" and "I know what you did last summer" too many times. The holes of the GIANT plot abound; Although I can not congratulate you on this movie, it is good to know that you are finally trained to go to the bathroom. Actors (or the lack of them): only the best for this movie ... the best extras you've ever seen on a screen, starring your debut as speakers! As a disclaimer, I must bear in mind that I am able to see and enjoy almost anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still laugh and smile during Bubble Boy (yes folks, it's true); So when I say that to avoid something, you KNOW I'm not kidding.
