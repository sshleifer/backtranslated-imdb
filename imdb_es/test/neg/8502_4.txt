Other critics seem to have had this film in high esteem. For something done by an eighteen-year-old film student, I'd say bravo, but that's not the case. If you want to see a good movie about graffitti, stick to documentaries. It was filmed with the same quality as a domestic digital video. The two main characters are sad actors and once again that would be fine if it were a student movie. The plot follows a lone artist skating around Portland writing graffiti. He joins another and they skate together creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between them that is never really discussed because this movie has almost as much dialogue as an image of Charlie Chaplin. This film shows the gravity that street artists give to their form, and the music is good, but in general I would not call it a movie.
