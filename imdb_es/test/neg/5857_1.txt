I saw this movie last night, a satire of the reality style shows that seem to be doing the rounds right now. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I absolutely hated it. As interesting as seeing the painting dry and perhaps with one or two moments a little funny. <br /> <br /> Maybe it had something to do with me, I'm definitely not a fan of the Survivor and Big Brother type, but if this had been a video / DVD or if I'd been watching it in the movies on my own, definitely I would not have endured more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
