How do you take a cast of experienced and well-known actors, and create such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers in an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they arrive at first base with their plans, everything quickly falls apart. With an argument like this, you would think that it could not be so bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie, we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday people. They joke, they laugh, they have drinks together, etc. Then, suddenly we learn that they plan to steal their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is absorbed by the scheme due to the cold and cruel world, although he is a decorated veteran, a good guy and a reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then, in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys almost all become psychopaths crazy about money, willing to kill each other for money. In the last scenes, Mike, (Matt Dillon), suffers a suicide attack for the sole reason of killing his old friend. The viewer has no indication before this end that these men are so ruthless and bloodthirsty. It is absolutely amazing and the "B movie" is almost too kind for this kind of cheesy plot. I would say do not waste your time. Too bad nobody has given Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before taking this photo.
