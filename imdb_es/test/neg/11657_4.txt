This movie seemed like it was rushed to premiere for some reason. It is definitely not a well made movie. So amazing. The scenes where the president (Holbrook) was in the center and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be an opportunity for ordinary people to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life. If it were not for blood and blasphemy, it was filmed as a television movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. The talents of Holbrook (president) were never realized in this film. Shatner's performance is fine. The production values ​​in this movie leave much to be desired. In general, I think most people would be better off if they did not waste time looking at this issue.
