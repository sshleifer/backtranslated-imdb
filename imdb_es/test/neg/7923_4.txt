Movies like these do not need sequels. Part of the advantage of Don Bluth distancing himself from Disney is that he did not have to suffer his endless tirade of cash and unfocused sequels. But apparently, it was a brilliant idea for someone to make a sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven," so we understand this. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and is not really that good. Most of the movie is just a bad excuse for a sequel and it's not as dark, different or entertaining as the original. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the future generations who are going to have to suffer infinitely sequels like this, without even knowing what it was like to have a moment when Hollywood was not totally dependent on the successful movies as a crutch to throw the garbage banal. <br /> <br /> Please, no more sequels of children's films that I do not need.
