I can not believe that someone paid to make this movie. Stupid, unreal and stereotyped. Since the takeoff of the massive 747, the pilot removed the regulating valves to increase the speed. then you have 5 people armed with fully automatic semiautomatic weapon fire without a single bullet reaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. Then, once under the belly of the plane, a stray bullet hits a FUEL line and we see that the fuel escapes from the side of the plane. The acting was horrible and forced. There just did not seem to be any direction. I've seen some pretty horrible B movies in my life but with the names that were in this movie, I felt extremely disappointed.
