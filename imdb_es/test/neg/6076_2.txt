I made a big mistake when I saw this movie. That's the lottery of going to see movies, I suppose. After five minutes, you knew it was going to be a mess, and I struggled to stay in my seat: the old feeling of "losing two hours of your life". <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning all the thread of "historical accuracy" reviews, the script is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have been extended to an hour to give a plausible idea, Real development of the plot. Instead, he moved from one "dramatic" dramatic event to the next. Having the girl crying at the beginning of the movie does not make sense because the audience has no emotional connection to anything at this time. And all that walking towards the sunset through the long field of grass at the end, what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Even the excellent Ed Harris could not save this one. You could almost feel his pain in some of the lines he had to pronounce. The most fabulously scary was, for no apparent reason, that he looks at the girl while she copies her work in her apartment, looks up, everything goes a little fuzzy, romantic, an illumination (or I'm dreaming), and he says, with authority in your voice, <br /> <br /> "LAV√çEME". <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes it, with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? That is hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there was the music. The long session in which was simply the direction of Beethoven and the Ninth Symphony that left the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waited, they waited, they remained silent for what seems an eternity. And then, finally, launching into a huge sound. It was spooky wonderful and I dare say it, it filled my eyes with tears. <br /> <br /> So that's where the movie captured two stars. The only part of the film in which Beethoven came to say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
