This film is about a mysterious love letter that changed the love life of 4 people. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is interesting, and the movie could have been fun. However, this movie is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are not entered correctly at the beginning, so it becomes so confusing. The secondary characters come and go without adequate reasons, as if they existed only for a particular scene and then disappear into the air. The pace is terribly slow, it makes the 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and fun, but this movie spectacularly did not either.
