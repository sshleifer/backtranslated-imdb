I found this movie in a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing about this is that Camp Video acquired the rights and enrolled in 1986 in the credits. Anyway, enough of strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary at all. Even calling this horror or a "thriller" is laughable. In this 80-minute movie, maybe there are only 5 minutes in most of what you would call horror, and that was the performance, because it was HORRORible! Leaving aside word games, the writing of this movie was also absolute rubbish, just as special effects and makeup were ridiculous. No wonder this is such a dark film, probably the director has spent the last 35 years touring the country looking for all existing copies and burning them in a large pile so that no one else can be subjected to it.
