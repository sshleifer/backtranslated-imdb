Thunder Alley finds Fabian excluded from the NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another driver. Stanley Adams might want to put him on his running team, but the other drivers are not to have him around. <br /> <br /> Desperate for employment, Fabian hooks up with the owner of an automotive stunt program Jan Murray, who is paying him peanuts and trying to cash in on Fabian's bad reputation. He has to take it, but Annette Funicello, Murray's daughter, offers another reason to stay. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian's struggle to return to the NASCAR circuit while juggling Annette at the same time. and her current friend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has everything about Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helped by the shot to the spot on the NASCAR south tracks and the good images of the NASCAR races. Not helped by a rather silly story that delves into the real reason for Fabian's problems and their unrealistic recovery from them. <br /> <br /> Even NASCAR fans could opt for this.
