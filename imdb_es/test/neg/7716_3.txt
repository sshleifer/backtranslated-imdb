If you have not seen the first one, you should at least know someone who has it and you should know that it was painful to sit down. There was simply nothing good to say about it. So, what is different about the second one? Why bother to make a sequel to a movie that was unfortunate? This one does not take himself too seriously. He knows he was made for television and does not try to impress with an excellent or serious dialogue. There are times when you try to get 'serious' or 'intense', but these moments are so cheesy that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all the elements of Uwe Boll and any hint that this originated from a video game (apart from the course title). Do not enter this movie waiting for something worth mentioning to your friends unless you are in the camp, in the lame zombie movies, or who are interested in making a game to drink with this movie. Take two shots each time the character of Ed Quinn mentions his dead brother! Take a shot every time a bullet would have been better in a zombie's head instead of pumping three in the chest! etcetera etcetera.
