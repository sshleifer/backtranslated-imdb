I'm not prone to ranting and, to begin with, my expectations were low, but why did I think it was a good idea? The fact that he has a camera, some big and ugly friends for the actors and the delusions of talent does not mean that he has to go out and make a movie. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, that is, I should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this garbage found a dealer to help him escape the limits of a cubicle of 3 by 4 feet. It goes from bad to worse. Speaking of low budget, a torture scene consists of a guy who throws a cup of coffee while tied to a chair. Obviously, this is very painful because the big baby screams in agony ... maybe he ordered decaffeinated! The acting is worse than the wooden one (I could possibly see a tree for 30 seconds before getting bored completely, if you can see this garbage for so long, you're a better man than me!) And the fighting scenes would be at home playground of kindergarten. Do not touch this movie, unless you enjoy the pain (in which case you should try to spill warm coffee on you). I would like to say that it is so bad that it is good, but in reality this is just horrible.
