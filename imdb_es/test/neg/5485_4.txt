This is my first Almodavar movie. I will confess that we chose it mainly because we knew that this had the attractive perspective of Antonio Banderas in the gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's all this film has to recommend it. I consider myself a very sophisticated spectator, I like European films, "art" films, and in general I can recognize a quality film even if it is not my particular taste. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a complete blank for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it "hilarious comedy", but I did not laugh once. Loose and uncomfortable, with a lot of useless dialogue. I do not understand this at all ... it seems like an amateur effort. Can someone light me up?
