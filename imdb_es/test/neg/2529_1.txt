I can not believe it! Were they crazy about filming a movie about Connecticut in Southern California? For God's sake, there are palm trees everywhere. In one of the initial scenes, a boy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald", it has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES". (Referring to the newspaper Stamford, Connecticut). Maybe the filmmakers should have investigated a bit, I mean my god, at least hit the name of the newspaper, or film in places that look at least remotely like Connecticut.
