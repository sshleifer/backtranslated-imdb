The first 10 minutes of the film make fun of sequels and movies of pg-13. These are the 2 reasons why the movie is so bad. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo", which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time you do this, you will be really angry. Travolta is not very good, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. However, they are not the kind of humor one would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie. If you have not seen it short, you probably like to be cool. If you liked to get a short film, you will leave the cinema wanting to kill the director and the screenwriter. Wait for the DVD
