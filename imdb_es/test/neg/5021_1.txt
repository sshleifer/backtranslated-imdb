"Inuyasha" was horrible. This show was amazingly superimposed, but this is nothing more than a tedious group of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless, the story is boring and endless. I think it might have been interesting if I had better writing, but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in showing Inuyasha and his stupid friends. fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and many circles around the same thing over and over again. The script is cheesy and silly and the animation is poor. The design of the character is very ugly, I do not know why everyone loves it, they all have the same face! : Big eyes, tiny noses, a line like the mouth and the typical anime haircuts. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and silly. This has to be one of the most overrated animated shows ever made.
