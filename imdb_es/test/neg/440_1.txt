This DVD lacks its vocation as a Heineken roller coaster ... This is a great example of why no one should go to see a sequel with a director / writer different from the original. Two hours of this turkey left me asking for repetitions of Exorcista 2. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughs. It's not a decent scare. The script was just a disaster and I felt bad for the actors who had to interpret it (they must have had sick family members at home or coca monster habits or something like that). . So, naturally, the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to scrap the makeup FX and make CG werewolf instead. These CG werewolves made me laugh a lot more than any of the "comedy." It was just a total lack. If you want a night of entertainment, re-rent the original. Or take a film class and make your own horror movie. You are bound to do better than these fools.
