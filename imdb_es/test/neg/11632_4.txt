Some changes for the better (special effects are more elaborate), others for the worse (Scott Grimes, a nice boy in the original, has become an uncomfortable teenager), but in general this sequel is on par with the original. that does not say much The PG-13 rating is questionable; Although the film does not give any fear at all, there is a bit of brief but rather explicit gore, and a bit of nudity out of place.
