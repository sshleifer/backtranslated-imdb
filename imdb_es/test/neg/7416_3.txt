Hi everyone, I just wanted to give you some crazy facts about this movie. Actually, I was one of the Make-up FX artists who helped create the "beast" for this movie and I have to tell you that the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we recovered the first photos of the series, we were all talking about how embarrassing this creature was in a movie that would probably be quite poor. <br /> <br /> What really happened was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and shoot a large part of the creature again. The sad part was that Jason died a few weeks before that, so the renewed creature was not as amazing as the original. <br /> <br /> For me it was quite sad because this was Jason's final. film, and somehow he was tricked of his final fame due to the bad repetitions. Anyway, I thought you might be interested a bit, and if you want, you can go to mmmyeah.com and see some pictures "behind the scenes". <br /> <br /> Later, Jeff
