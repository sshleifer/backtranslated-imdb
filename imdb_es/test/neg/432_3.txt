It is likely that this sequel does not save you. It is not a sequel. AWIL is a classic. But this movie is as far from being a classic as you can get. What a joke Special effects that are not very special. Horrible dialogue , without acting. and a ridiculously ridiculous, fast and unconvincing subplot, (not to mention fleeting) added with about a third of the film left. I mentioned that the story is not so convincing. However, it is too stupid to be funny in any way. The grade you currently have (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My rating for an American werewolf in Paris: a 3.5 / 10
