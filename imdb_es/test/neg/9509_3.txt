It's true that the only reason I saw this movie, since it's been about a decade since its release, was by Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his representation of my second favorite character in this work. In any case, this film is as gritty as anything that Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the work have been left out. I understand the address / editing options, but I do not think it really does justice to the work. Maybe I'm too purist. I would have to direct the people (who have read this far) to Branagh's version, if it were not for I despise their tendency towards excessive dramatization. Anyway, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, were not we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all he has done is show that he wants to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> ... Perhaps the only Shakespeare-worthy performance here is Scofield as The Ghost.
