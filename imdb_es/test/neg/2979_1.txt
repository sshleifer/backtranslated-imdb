This feels like a long-lasting treatment of a comedy-routine that could also have been said in a short ten minutes. In addition, the technical credits are sup-par. The film really feels like a diploma project from a film school. <br /> <br /> The cast is a mix of experienced theater professionals and talented newcomers, but the problem is the superficial script. Their lines feel constructed, exactly like the material of a television program. <br /> <br /> The director does not take his protagonists seriously, so we are not moved by his problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film has been marketed intelligently and offers a unique point of sale, but in the end the film disappoints at all levels.
