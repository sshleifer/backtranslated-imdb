What a horrible movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to have been born and raised in Canada, but he had an Indian accent thicker than his parents! Is it me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the girls in Canada dress up as whores? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed as strippers. Do not waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the scenery in beautiful Vancouver. I wonder why Bollywood is going through a depression? It's for movies like this. I miss the old days when Hindi movies were really entertaining. I could not even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the Hollywood style because it just does not work. They need to maintain their roots because that is what makes Indian films entertaining.
