I just saw this movie just for Sarah and I also give her these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Acting was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a movie that continued to contradict itself. The film was neglected and unoriginal. It's not like I'm waiting for a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. This did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think about the general plot, the less sense it actually has and the more holes we find. It's really a shame, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being a little hard giving the movie a 4/10 but given the actors involved and, again, the obvious writing talent of SARA, this movie really should have delivered much more.
