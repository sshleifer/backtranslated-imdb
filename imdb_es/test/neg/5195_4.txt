If I had known what I was submitting to, I would have fled the theater. The movie is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. Despite the amazing images, the fascinating places and a subject that could have been fascinating, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I was not familiar with this period of Greek history and was prepared to experience a great movie. The hand of the filmmakers is heavy. It is not enough to see a train pass by; We must see it from afar, we must see it car by car, we must see the smoke, we must see it slow down and we must see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. In the same way, the characters that he creates never develop, never change. They are so stereotyped that we ask ourselves, are they destined to be Everyman? All the girls? All the musicians? Is there any point in this allegory? It's the most pretentious movie I've seen in a long time.
