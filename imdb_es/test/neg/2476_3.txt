None of this movie stands out as being big or terrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills him. The softness is not good. I can not say I expected something better from Will Smith, but I definitely did Kevin James from "The King of Queens", but lately I'm getting used to saying a lot of things. This film tries to make its mark as an ingenious romantic comedy, but never comes to the eyes of an ox. In fact, it never hits * anywhere * inside the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; The fact that Kevin James can not dance is something that would not surprise anyone with his guard down, and therefore (in a movie like this) is not funny. This movie constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong strategy at the wrong time. Some parts are fine (but I'm looking for examples in my brain), but I really think that this movie should be avoided.
