I saw the MST3K version of the movie, and this revision includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, it looked like it might be a cheesy sci-fi movie, but the more I looked at it, the more disappointing it got. The first reason is quite idiosyncratic: I liked much more the shy girl with glasses than the Wanda model at the end of the movie. More profoundly, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and the change of clothes replaced any real growth of the character. Instead of becoming a character who could take care of herself, Wanda relied so much on men to do everything for her as she was at the beginning of the movie. The performance could have been better (although I got tired of the cracks in the voice of Ireland, they were even in the movie! It's not that bad). The background was fine, but it was a bit silly (aliens = humans with facial paint), and I could have used more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just that I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the robots did little for me. The movie could have been better without them. <br /> <br /> In general (for the film itself, not for the MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was a good movie, for what it was.
