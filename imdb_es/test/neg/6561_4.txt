The weakest film of the "old" crew of Star Trek, this movie suffers from a horrible script and obvious budgetary restrictions, particularly in the badly handled ending. The bones of a good movie are here, and Shatner's direction is not as bad as it is commonly established, but the characters end up talking and acting out of the style that the previous 3 movies had carefully set. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the renegade Vulcan with mystical and mysterious powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for Deforest Kelley, who shines as McCoy's "Bones" in this his second latest film . However, in spite of how good these scenes are, they ultimately do not advance in the plot and end up feeling more like a distraction. A great score from the always reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite among the three main ones are not enough to cover the chasms that open up in the plot, and the downright embarrassing attempts of humor only serve to alienate even the hard hikers. In short, a lot of possibilities that, although it does not comply, has its moments. Watch out for the pool table at the bar fight scene ...
