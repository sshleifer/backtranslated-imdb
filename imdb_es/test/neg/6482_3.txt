The remake of roles of "The Major and the Minor" of 1942 makes Jerry Lewis participate in the role originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately, this anemic exit is missing much more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to pass as a child when boarding a train; It is successful, but deception leads to a series of comical and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the script, releasing musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another in his Second Bananas stable) and a secondary plot of jewelry theft (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who played the cunning teenager in the original movie, plays Lewis's love interest here. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 of ****
