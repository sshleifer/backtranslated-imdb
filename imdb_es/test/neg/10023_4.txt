Everything that everyone has said already sounds pretty true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Images of endless nature, bad acting. Apart from these elements, this is a movie that can be seen for fans of slasher that, in some cases, is considered a cult classic. . There is also a single three-minute banjo that shows Bostwick's ability behind the instrument. It's not bad if I say it myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the 'movie' are your salvation. The end still chases me until today. This can also have a short-lived advantage, since John Carl Bucheler makes his special effects. Some may know him through films like 'Troll' and 'Friday the 13th, part 7 - He directed both films. In short, this is not a film in which everyone will find something that redeems. In fact, at the Hollywood level, this can be classified right there with one of the most amateurish efforts of business, but for that handful (but very loyal) fanatics of slasher movies in the world, including bad performances and scenes of atrocious nature can be forgiven.
