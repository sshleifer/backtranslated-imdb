Well, <br /> <br /> First of all, as many critics have pointed out, this is a scam from the story of Martin Cahill, represented for the first time by the BBC and John Boorman's film "The General", which is a great movie and very, very superior to this one. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native British person, the cast of Kevin Spacey was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan, but it was totally wasted. The characters were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey, he did not appear as an adorable rogue, but as nothing really important or significant. <br /> <br /> Not much to redeem this movie. The best parts are the gags and the tricks that are cut from the other films that it starts. Compare the notes of this movie and "The General." I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
