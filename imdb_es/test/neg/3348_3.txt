A guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns to live even after death through telekinesis. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) has to spend the night there to join a group called "The Sisters". And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Stupid movie. I saw him in a theater when he was 21 years old and I was generally bored. The classification of PG should have realized me: this is a horror movie for children. A really stupid scene at the end has a body that breaks through concrete to hit a young boy! To begin with, the corpses are placed in HEAD first, which makes it impossible for the corpse to use its arms and there is no way for anyone to get through the concrete. When you're noticing silly mistakes like that, the movie is not doing its job. <br /> <br /> It has two good scenes: two of "The sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses that crowd them. In a moment, one of the sisters hits a corpse in the stomach: her hand goes inside the body and can not get it out! That scene has stayed with me ever since. And there's a little cute that involves a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which made my audience laugh). But the rest of the movie is a dark and opaque memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give it a 3.
