Bam Margera, of Jackass fame, is back with his own reality show, and not only is not as fun as Jackass, but he is also incredibly stupider. This has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived. Of course there are worse reality shows, but none is so mean or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera has done it in a big way, and her parents decided to run away from her fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his team of idiot friends all live together, and while Bam and his friends are breaking things and making mischief, their parents are usually at home being stupid. When Bam's parents are not at home being lazy, they are being tortured by Bam, especially by his father. To increase the mood, we are treated with his fat uncle, Don Vitto, who is constantly out of this and without paying attention. <br /> <br /> This program really is like a Jackass version ... toned. in the sense that there is no acrobatics, instead, Bam and his friends are just going to break things and do stunts and, meanwhile, the loud music sounds to make it even more impressive. This is not funny in the least. I can not imagine a more stupid show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence here. <br /> <br /> If you're a huge fan of Bam Margera, and want to see one of the many cash follow-ups / sequels of the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * outside of ****. 30 minutes.
