Several people recommended this movie to me and, after reading all the positive comments on this site, I bought a copy of the film on eBay. The acting in the film is normal and a little trite, especially by the family of cannibals, a sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is ranting and raving the burned corpse, speaking directly to the camera. It's one of those performances where you just shudder and feel bad for that poor actor. It is also evidence of some of the worst editions I have seen, there is a terrible leap in the middle of his "speech". However, there are some creepy moments and sometimes the music works well ... but overall the movie is not that good and I do not know why people think Wes Craven is a great director. So far he has not shown me anything that he thinks is brilliant, the only thing that improved with the Cravens films, production to production was his budget.
