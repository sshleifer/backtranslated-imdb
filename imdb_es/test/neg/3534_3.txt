This is Wes Craven at his worst! This is the worst of the horrors, if you can call it horror, you will always see it, especially from one of the horror masters, Wes Craven, Poor Direction, Poor Acting, Poor Set, Poor Atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of garbage of all the times. The bad guy is not convincing, you could not even feel sorry for him! The blood, and the horror involved in the movie is ridiculous, it's just nonsense! The only positive points I can think of are: It's starring Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but not even that cast could keep it from getting out of control and become one of the worst horrors of all time. If you still do not see it, do not bother, you'll just hate it.
