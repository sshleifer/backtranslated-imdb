Done and published at the time the Internet was getting huge, this is a story that Hitchcock would have loved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not present to do so, and from time to time we are left with a thriller of suspense but mostly silly, which is held (barely) next to Bullock's intelligence. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995 but it is already dated, and the amount of errors and inaccuracies regarding computers must be seen to be believed. And you do not even have to be a dot.com person to detect them!
