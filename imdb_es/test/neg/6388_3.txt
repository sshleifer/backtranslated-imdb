Maybe it's unfair for me to review this movie because I went out a lot before the end. That's strange, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream once, many years ago, when I saw him on stage. <br /> <br /> I think two things affected me: that shriek Twerp with the name of Shakespeare, Calista Flockhart and Michelle Feiffer sitting on a gigantic deck. Well, I guess you could say that it's supposed to be a comedy, but when the stage is fun and the actors are not, I'd say we have a bad movie in our hands ...
