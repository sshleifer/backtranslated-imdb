Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in in the 70s, this is the most spectacular of all. It is so elegant that you can try the dust of the sets and feel the heat of the lamps above. The thing seems a school work of very, very big budget or, in fact, a very low budget action movie, which actually is. It has been said on many occasions that this was the last of the gender entries, and I hope it is. The genre did not die peacefully, but in a horrible agony, in the midst of a lot of smoke, fake blood and terrible sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt like a child again, like a mad professor whose shirt stays snow white after the knights have crawled through the shit holes of the Underworld. What a sport it was, accept a part in this mixture and take it with such courage. <br /> <br /> Filmed entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by the soundtrack of fashion synthesizers, now unbearable, the main attraction of this film are cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in an adaptation of Burroughs, but they rarely manage to be so ridiculous, helpless or devoid of credibility. Sometimes, during the high action combat scenes in which Mr. McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the sound empty and empty when his head hits the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, animals explode and catch fire the moment they stumble and fall. In fact, there are a lot of unmotivated explosions as the movie (and genre) nears the end. And the lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworld accent. <br /> <br /> The triple account, currently on the market, presents this film and two others: The Land that forgot about time and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are pretty strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and, sometimes, even fascinating script turns. Do not expect any of these qualities of this movie. Get drunk with friends and blatantly laugh at what you see. After all, the manufacturers also had no shame.
