Destined as light entertainment, this film is really successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a script that quickly collapses. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as shop window mannequins in a department store where one afternoon they arrive late and lock themselves in them, after which witness, from its less protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurs on the street. The ostensible killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to observe the mannequins, as he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses of the violent event of the previous night and, when one of the Couple perched "shudders", the fun begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective who takes the report of a crime remembers Harry's criminal record, he becomes cynical. There are many ways in which a movie can be trite, and it manages to use most of them, including a mandatory slow motion scene of passion. In a low-budget study in Vancouver, even the procedural aspects of the police are displayed by heart. The always capable Gershon tries to do something of his role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, curiously, since he attacks his lines with an evident free rein. Although the film sinks into nonsense, the director of photography Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow his example, as he configures with the camera and illuminates some splendidly made compositions in which a viewer can focus while ignoring the holes of the plot and the dialogue without ingenuity. Hal Beckett brings a well-crafted score, appropriately based on the action. Nelson and Gershon, at the beginning, the aforementioned dialogue is something new and delivered well, but in a later context of continuity of logic and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or points of view, and the failures of post-production make the work go further than what should be expected for a basic thriller.
