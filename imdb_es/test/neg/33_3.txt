I'm sorry, but Jacqueline Hyde (do you understand? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst interpretations of this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first grader with learning disabilities not diagnosed <br /> <br /> Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion from a grandfather she never knew she had. Guess who? Yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over body and mind, yes, that Mr. Hyde! <br /> <br /> Despite some beautiful scenes of the skin, this film does not register any feeling or emotion that is not an uncontrollable laugh. <br /> <br /> As much as poor Jackie tries, she can not stand on the sidelines. Grandpa's special formula and the result is an hour and a half of lost time.
