I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club, you know, those modern, trendy places where you can find yourself late on Saturday night. Well, there is not an ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The score is ridiculous, the original songs are horrible, the singing of both main actors is continually out of tune (to be nice) and, at best, unprofessional. The only decent cinematic moments are the scenes of archival images. The jazz club scenes present a sophisticated dialogue stifled by too busy organ music. This Joey by Francesco should keep his work daily (unless his daily work is helping with movie scores). Is it possible not only to recover my four dollars, but also to pay for my therapy sessions? This movie, curiously enough, is so bad that you'll want to see it. Something like driving through a bad accident: you only have to look at least once. Just have the earplugs ready!
