The latest installment of the Karate Kid series is predictable, of bad performance and so bad that borders the pleasant. But not quite, it's just bad. In this installment, Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, as he has been in one of the many episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's friends from World War II. His parents have recently passed away and his grandmother is trying unsuccessfully to raise this young hell. In steps Mr. Miyogi to fix things. True to the formula, there is a group of neo-fascist thugs, called Alpha Troopers, who must be put in place and a new karate movement called Mantis religiosa. As I said before, this movie is a disaster, and should be avoided.
