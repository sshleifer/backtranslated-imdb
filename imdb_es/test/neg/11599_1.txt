The good first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful scene of drunks. He does it, they tickled me to finally have the opportunity to laugh. And there were other moments that seemed fun to me: Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective pipe and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery, trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by telling a stranger nothing sweet. <br /> <br /> But in general, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions imposed on productions by the Hays Code. But this was embarrassing and horrible to watch. Of course I knew they would end up together, this is a romantic comedy, after all. But it did not make sense, it happened too fast. Also, I can not believe the professions of love when I face such painful behavior, both physical and confrontational.
