probably the worst feature of the creature, boa vs python was a million times better than this, and it was not great, bad acting, negative effects and guess what DVD is one of those with 3 hours of previews before the main menu. Probably the least terrifying film, without blood or violence, people are stupid and still use guns when they do not affect these animals. Outside the Jurassic park, boring and not worth even looking, but I guess the stupidity of the characters is quite funny, so it would be a good comedy movie, but it is definitely not a thriller.
