First of all ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but she is not such a good actress frankly. Spencer, his brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly, on the other hand, tries to show her heart, but ... I'm sorry, it's just not good. Sam does not even get credit, I mean, ICARLY ... pretty self-centered, huh? Freddy is not bad, I do not have a comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude every time they go to shoot a web casting, they will scream all their lines. It's kind of a bad influence because Carly has a web program and if the kids copy this, she could be giving her own information and that's not quite sure. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that it has SOME fun parts of the show that make it entertaining. At least this show is not boring, it has pretty frames, quite strong. Many children will like this because they do not look for flaws. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad show, but it is not boring.
