This is, by far, one of the most pretentious films I've seen. It's a slap in the face of some Indians who speak English and look in the mirror. disgusting. The chewing gum version of the politics of the 70s in the plains of northern India. The message: the educated Indian who speaks English tried to save the poor beggars of India in all seriousness. ignore the fact that poor beggars are also capable of saving themselves. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, it's fine. The problem is that the love story and character development are based on a completely fraudulent version of the policy.
