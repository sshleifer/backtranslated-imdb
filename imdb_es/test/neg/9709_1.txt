This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice that has been filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a comment on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, so it disappoints the viewers who expect it to do justice to the novel. <br /> <br /> There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance to which Darcy mocks Elizabeth is not the refined dance performed by the nobility, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families belong, but rather it is the dance of the lower classes. The gentry would not have been dancing like they were in a peasant barn dance. There are also clothing and hair problems. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear hats when outdoors. Women of the Regency era were not so liberated as to renounce bonnet requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the morning meeting of Elizabeth (in a nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (without a tie and waistcoat) in which they admit their mutual love. This is an unforgivable freedom with the novel. No respectable young or gentleman would venture into the open air in such a state of undressing or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing of all with this movie is the mutilation of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue does not need the help of a writer who believes he can write as Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent, but he does not feel Austen's style either. The juxtaposition of the two styles is discordant. <br /> <br /> As for the performance, the best is Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties by making Mrs. Bennet less horrible than the portrait of Austen. Its representation is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is a disaster. His affected British accent is terrible and portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the twentieth century and not as a father of the late eighteenth century. The representation of Matthew MacFadeyn of Darcy is flat. I can not imagine anyone falling in love with their lord Darcy. Keira Knightly is a beautiful Elizabeth, but her interpretation of Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. Knightly focuses on Elizabeth's frankness, but her representation completely lacks an understanding of the social customs and conventions of the time. I would have done well to read the novel before playing Elizabeth and do some research on the behavior of the women of the time. <br /> <br /> If one is making a film of the time, one must be faithful to the novel. period. This movie needed a historical advisor who really knows something about the Regency period. I also needed a writer who would appreciate and understand Austen's text better. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decides to make a Pride and Prejudice movie in the near future to erase this abomination of our minds. <br /> <br /> The best that can be said about this movie is that it contains many beautiful scenes from the English countryside. Chatsworth is used well as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But beautiful landscapes and beautiful actors can not save this movie. True fans of Austen will run home to watch their DVDs of the much higher BBC production of 1995 with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text to erase this version of their minds.
