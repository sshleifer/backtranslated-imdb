I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie, but then I found out that it is a movie made for the television channel. On my DVD cover of 2 critics, one of the critics, Stephen Farber of Moviline, presented it as the best movie in the world. Year ... <br /> <br /> All the characters were simple and decent interpretations, except the character of the Brain, which never has the scope that the director wanted to keep mysterious until the end ... there was suspense until the end, but when you see the end that lady The police officer and the main culprit of having a lesbian affair seems to be a totally stupid idea. God knows what happens to DAVE, the main male character. <br /> <br /> The other critic of Mr. Brown's Movies said that Shocking and Effective but is not up to all the Hype ... that I saw after watching the movie. So I was partially in agreement ... I should have read this before I took the movie ...
