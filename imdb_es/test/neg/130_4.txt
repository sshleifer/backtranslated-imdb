To see the trailer, the movie looked quite interesting. The production of the film is also quite good: it seems that they had a good budget and it does not seem like a cheap movie. The acting varies from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the movie is weak. The film begins as if it were interesting and ends with a poorly executed spin, disappointingly boring. Seeing the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie look good, but everything that makes it is an absolutely boring movie to watch. It is as if they made a short film and then tried to force it to last more than an hour by filling the medium with an hour of filler material. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose a good hour and a half of your Life, watch this movie. Otherwise, get away from this extremely boring movie.
