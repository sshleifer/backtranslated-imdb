This is a big disappointment. The main problem is the performance. Sylvestre le Touzel is quite poor like Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very forced and unnatural. In addition, the camera work is very narrow in 1980, that is to say, narrow and agitated, in comparison with that of P & P of 1995, for example. <br /> <br /> The script is, if it is too faithful to the book, and there are some expressions worthy of cringe that should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In all respects, this is far inferior to the recent film version, which although took many liberties with the book, seemed much more faithful to the spirit of the book and was much more enjoyable.
