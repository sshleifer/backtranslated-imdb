A very, very, very slow movie, without direction on a distraught and adrift young man. I'm not sure who was more lost: the flat characters or the audience, almost half of whom left. <br /> <br /> Trying cunning with smart camera angles in black and white and white, the film disappointed, it became even more ridiculous, since the acting was bad and the plot and lines almost nonexistent. Very little music or anything to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales employees before they find the album. The cute scene promised, but it went downhill from there. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, what it means ... If it's a vacuum, it works, I guess it's empty. Wasted two hours
