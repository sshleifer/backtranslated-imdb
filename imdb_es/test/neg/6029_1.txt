This is the worst war movie I've seen, possibly the worst one ever made. I find it incredible that some people have qualified it as a 10. It has a surprising lack of even rudimentary traces of realism. Almost all the clich√©s of war movies appear in this film and are badly made. On the other hand, I would not have seen it until the end if it had not been so extraordinarily bad that I had fun.
