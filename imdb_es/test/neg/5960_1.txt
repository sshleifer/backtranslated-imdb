Do you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? The chupacabra is that. "Manos: Las manos del destino" is the worst movie of all time, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. He must also have the distinction of having the worst leading actor of all time. Eric Alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never made another movie other than El Chupacabra, gee, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is attacked moves very slowly and is really stupid. And, there are no cops in this city, only two idiot detectives - Hi! The cops appear at the homicide scene first, then the detectives come. And, apparently, the monster only attacks in the backyard of a person, and in a deserted area next to the docks. Or ... those are the only places where filmmakers can access the movie. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is the reason why the IMDb should allow us to give negative stars. This easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They must allow a rating of 0.
