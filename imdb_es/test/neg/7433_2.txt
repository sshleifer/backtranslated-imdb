I've always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked very good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently discovered that his father died and is expected to hear his will. He discovers that his father was a clown, because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and deliver it to a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small moments of humor, like the frontal tilt of a truck and Murray screaming, but in general, it does not make sense. Pretty poor
