THE SPOILERS FOLLOW, and I have not even seen it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder is related to the villainous property developer who wants to develop the riverbank, and Dickens was killed because he was trying to uncover a similar unpleasant plot. If someone who has seen it could warn me if I am absolutely right, you will have saved me the time necessary to see something worthwhile and the rest of us will know how to get away from this film and its enthusiastic critics. On the other hand, * it sounds * intriguing; but if it were good, would it really be given away with a Sunday rag? And what kind of history does Foley have anyway? <br /> <br /> ... Then, as a public service, I managed to sit through it. It's worse than 'Swept Away'. Really. I have read stories of eight-year-old children with more drama than this. Really horrible And I had half a reason.
