A clever story / general location for a story. The action is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The leading villain was a nice change, but it could have been better. "I love you" was more exaggerated than "you complete me", but at least Van Damme had the opportunity to show a little tenderness. One of Van Damme's best movies.
