Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else on the web. This is a good portrait, although I do not totally agree. Taran is a commercial type and, therefore, only from his perspective. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, looks like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this seems a pale reflection of that. one in some parts ... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara ... both are good! The first has a better talent for acting, although the second one is recovering very well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the character of Anthara. She is true to her art, is not touched by any unnecessary emotion and is definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist, in fact she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her with a scientist would offend her. Hey ... Donald Trump ... maybe you have to get rid of Melania, here's Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal ... is not that easy? Abhishek, on the other hand, is a practical guy, who wants money, power, fame, etc. Therefore, these two, although struggling to penetrate the film industry, can not get along, given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the film is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in his total execution time, in one scene! What's new? This film has a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different in RGV movies, this one is also different, it's too slow for their standards. In parts, drag one almost to sleep. <br /> <br /> Remarkable It's hard to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think that this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also, it seems that Anthara is a professional in yoga, she is too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor with each movie. I am sure that your movie star blood is paying rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music in general was above average.
