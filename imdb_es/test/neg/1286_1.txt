This film descends like a square peg in a square hole. A badly made plug. A plug so cheap that it could not even be produced in a workshop assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to press the plug into the hole for which it is obviously designed, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotten fruit and do not wash. Quigly is a similar peg. <br /> <br /> This movie is so frighteningly horrible that it could not even have been created. A film like this must have been the result of some accident of nature; a monstrous entity that froze in the corner of a damp office somewhere and multiplied and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at. Only science would be interested in such a thing; Anyone who is not interested in studying it would exhume it from this world. <br /> <br /> What comes down to this is this: if you're the type who enjoys violin, racism or first-year Coca-Cola recitals, it could only be your birthday
