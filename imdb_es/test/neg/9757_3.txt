Teenage Exorcist is one of those spooky movies for the video that makes the viewer give up expectations of decent entertainment for sexual antics, teen humor and empty writing. This movie delivers exactly what I was trying to deliver. This is a girl who moves to a house where once lived a Baron de Sade (hmmm) and was finally attracted to him through his own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. Well, there's not much here in the form of horror or suspense. In fact, one line of the film sums up pretty well what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her (the name is Diane, by the way, and she plays Brinke Stevens) after trying to chainsaw her sister. He removes a gag from his mouth and says something like: "This will not be the last gag we see tonight." In fact, it was not like that. The special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this when interpreting its comedic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are fun. Robert Quarry, the old Count Yorga, really steals his scenes like an Irish priest. He prides himself on biblical verses and Irish songs. However, you know you're in trouble when Eddie Deezen gets the best billing. Deezen does his schtick and has a couple of good times too, but the material is too worn out to be anything more than a teenager's second-year time. Michael Berryman, of The Hills Have Eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the movie. As for the other actors, well, they're all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. Stevens is charming with fishnet stockings and French-cut panties, but beyond that do not expect much more from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and she shows a little more than Brinke (a very charming young woman by the way) and acts Brinke for miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be amused in the midst of mediocrity. Again, it's not a bad movie to waste a little time that involves NOT thinking. If you are a fan of Robert Quarry, watch at least his performance.
