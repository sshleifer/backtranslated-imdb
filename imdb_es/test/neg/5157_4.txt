The Nest is actually another horror movie that works like a nature simulator that fails due to low budget. The acting is fine, and the stage is great, but somehow, the whole movie seemed a bit boring. The gore effects are not the best I've seen, but they are fun in a cheesy way. Cockroaches are common cockroaches that bite people. The Nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, Slugs is a must as it is ten times better. It's also worth mentioning that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another 'Nature Run Amock' movie called Deadly Eyes (also known as The Rats), which deals with killer rats, as you might have guessed. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this kind of horror movies, you might want to give this one a watch, but it would be much better than seeing Slugs, which is much more interesting and bloody.
