Gordon Scott did some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> As I looked at it, I shuddered at the bad, obviously the interior sets and the wood cloning holes sound as they supposedly crossed I kept thinking, "Sheesh! This is the level of a program of TV!" Then I discover that they were, in effect, three pilot episodes of a television program that were interwoven into one. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott leave (alone), away from the sets, in some of them. the scenes; and the fights have some very good moves ... but oh, oh, and oh in terms of dialogue. And did I mention the performance? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most humans. <br /> <br /> And that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of sewing to see a younger Sherman (ie, Scatman) Carothers acting like a native. But it's probably not worth the total investment time.
