Sometimes you just have to have patients when you look indie horror. If you can just play your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will be presented ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with the "Scourge of Satan". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" tries to drag us into a boring festival of snoring from a movie, without a real reward at the end. I suppose that the cinematography in black and white (and blue) must have been for a reason, however, it is never explained why most of the blood is blue, and this seemed increasingly annoying to me as the film progressed. The story itself is not that bad, and it actually had some originality and decent content, but the acting is just pathetic. This, combined with the slow pace and lack of any real gore (red) made the "Scourge of Satan" to be forgotten quite quickly. I will give a grade of "4" for an ingenious dialogue that made me laugh, but unfortunately I could not save this boring waste of my time.
