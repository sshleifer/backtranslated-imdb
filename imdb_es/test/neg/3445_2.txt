OK look, this show is the worst show in nick @ night. I love so many shows at nick @ night and I love them. When this show came to nick @ night, I was so upset. It's such a boring and corny show. Of all the times I've seen, I found an episode a bit funny. This show has some of the most graceless and stupid jokes of all time. This show sums up terrible. Give support to Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not in the least intelligent. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I do not think it deserves to be played at nick @ night along with some great classic shows. This show lacks intelligence, good jokes and style.
