I should have realized that it was a sign of what would come when the trailer for this movie bored me. <br /> <br /> Having seen several "indie" movies about the strength of the critics here, and then discovering that my opinion is completely opposite to those of other critics, I began to wonder if it is possible that I am watching completely different movies of these people, or are they friends or family, etc. of the filmmakers who try to "expand" their work? Hmmm <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing a tribute from a Pulp Fiction fan and 11:14, except that it is made with worse actors, a silly score (undermines several scenes) and incredible jumps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please stop trying 'be' Samuel L Jackon to the Pulp Fiction. Nobody can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please, propose something original. It does you a bad service to produce these things by posing as Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Just terrible, and I really can not see how anyone could say that this is a good movie. It's a shame that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on this, like movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. It is not close to these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it a 3.
