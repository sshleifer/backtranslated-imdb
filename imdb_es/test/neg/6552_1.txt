This piece of trash belongs to the basement of an old moldy mansion where you will never see the light of day again. The only thing that scares this garbage is the price of admission. I just had fun when the final credits started rolling and I was free to leave the auditorium. What a hole not mitigated; A total waste of 1 hour and a half. When I die, I pray that I may return as a ghost and give a fever to the imbecile who wrote this deception.
