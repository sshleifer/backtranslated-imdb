This is a "whodunit" below average with the clich√© of everyone in the routine of the living room. Charlie Chan is a Secret Service agent who performs government tasks, and must find who killed a scientist who works in a bomb to defeat the German submarines in World War II. There is little to recommend with this film, since neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot. Charlie Chan fans will probably find this movie disappointing. Who dunit Who cares?
