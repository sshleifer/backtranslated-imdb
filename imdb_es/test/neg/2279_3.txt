Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have arranged two different scripts before coming up with this little event: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. It results in a disconcertingly casual movie. Christine Lahti plays a reporter and cynical television reporter who befriends Mary Tyler Moore, an aerobics instructor, and will soon have dinner with Moore and her family, only to discover that Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is the secret from Lahti! Burns has a strange rhythm of stop and start in his dialogue that is neither realistic nor effective (only more and more annoying, because it does not seem to say anything important). Moore, a thin man like a rail, looks alarmingly fragile in his leotard, has a radiant smile, but does not convince Danson's wife, and Danson is left with an insignificant and ungrateful role (he is only there to be a cad). The film tries to cover all bases in a classic case of overfeeding (the role of women in the workplace, the television news, the family infidel, the working wife and the mother who want more, the feminine need to have female friendships , etc.)), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas, since Burns only examines half-baked problems. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of ticks, but he also lacks a purpose, and the plot of the plot only gets complicated. * 1/2 of ****
