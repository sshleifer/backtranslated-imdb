Welcome to Plan 9 From the outer space of Star Trek movies. Come on, hikers, admit it. This movie is so bad, so inept inept in all departments, it has become a kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Shat offers the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. "BOONES! Hi, Bones! Brilliant! This is not just Ham, it's several large pig farms in Kentucky. <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. It must be done under the commercial descriptions law to use that term. The Enterprise is a piece of cardboard moving in this movie. Really! Even the TV show Star Trek had better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock sings Row Row Row Your ship. After fighting for the meaning of the words !!!! "The captain, life is not a dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, you really must want to strangle Shatner for this. Could not The Shat give us his interpretation of Mr. Tambourine Man or harmonize with Nimoy in Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Very disappointed. <br /> <br /> A resemblance to Sean Connery plays Spock's stepbrother. Just because they could not get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it's like watching your grandmother drunk shame at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back! Shat spins her a few times as a WWF fighter, and ruins her. Yayy The Shat! It seems that Connery 2.0 was a bit vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock has not mentioned it previously in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently killed his father with pity, BUT AFTER THEY FOUND A CURE. Tell me this is not hysterically funny. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise of Platform 11 suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's antigrav boots are also incredibly compatible with Bones and The Shat. I should have also used them on humpback whales on Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what God pretends to be, but I assume it's really a kind of strange being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. Sean Connery, the second, asks God to share his pain and he dies quickly. Or something. God punishes Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses did in this scene. <br /> <br /> The Shat, after having killed God, quickly returns to his singing with Spock and Bones. In total now, Row Row Row Your Boat ...
