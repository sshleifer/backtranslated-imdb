I can not understand why two million Danish people sit every week to watch this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simplistic. There is a hard man, a hard woman and a sensitive man. The writers really say that they have modeled the characters according to Greek mythology! Give me a break! All the characters are, of course, bright cops. When I have seen this program I have longed for "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are brilliant shows, and "Rejseholdet" is a terrible copy. This program is a symptom of the disease currently suffered by Danish television.
