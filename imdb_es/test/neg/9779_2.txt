I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I am an educated person. This movie made me lose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for humanity or just for myself. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is poor, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. I should be scared, but it looks pretty normal. The girl in the movie is a clich√©. The only thing I liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene. And, by the way, the ending was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking in the box. In fact, I was thinking more of an ant walking in the back seat of the car. But it still did not surprise me.
