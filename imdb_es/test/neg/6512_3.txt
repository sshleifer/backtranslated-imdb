It's not a good action thriller because, without success, it tends to be the same water as the first Steven Seagal films, because there is not a good set. Steven Seagal plays the same type of character he has played from Above the Law. In my opinion, the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such a normal movie and belongs to a much better movie. Bob Gunton is fine as the main heavy. The best performance in the whole movie belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the killer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the reasons for the movie to see The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the brief appearance of the beautiful and voluptuous Nikki Cox. It's a shame that there are no more scenes with her in them.
