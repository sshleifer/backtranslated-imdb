This P. de S. was recommended to me by two friends who have a great taste <br /> <br /> (similar to mine) in the movies and who have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie, but this is a wind bag effort that tries to pass itself off as a high-level movie. If it is low eyebrow? <br /> <br /> redeeming the social value "comes to mind, Bill Pullman is trying, maybe a little hard, and except for the boy, the rest of the acting seems shy and a little lame. <br / > <br /> Save yourself from this and watch a double feature of "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher". <br /> <br /> As someone said, this would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch was not the daughter of David Lynch overrated.
