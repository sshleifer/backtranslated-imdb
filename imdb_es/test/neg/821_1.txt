I had already heard about Ali G in Madonna's music video "Music". I always think it's funny. (In fact, it really is.) Last year, I always thought about buying a VCD from "Ali G Indahouse." That's why some months later, I bought it cheap and started to see it. <br /> <br /> But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I expected it to be a great laughing comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really very bad. It also contains explicit sexual content and very crude humor. It did not make me laugh either, just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh, by the way, I have plans to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was really different in his film compared to his television shows, in such a negative way. Maybe he was not really well focused and serious enough to make this movie. The fact that there are some sex scenes does not mean it's too hilarious (because sometimes, too much is not so ridiculous anymore). For the first time, I was disappointed. That really made me sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 1 out of 10. Actually, I really want to give it a rating of 0. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I would not recommend anyone who wants to see good comedies that are not so explicit or horrible.
