This game is a good shooter in the first person. ----------- Wait ... <br /> <br /> But, of course, you have to tell a story about this genre, so it's a pretty innovative plot about soldiers who now run drugs To save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is the drug of choice that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, now just give us some fun and challenging missions, throw some new weapons and free-terrain vehicles that can be driven in our free time and I'll be very happy. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creator of this game decides to create a propaganda game, driven by the military, that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and democracy. The game has twisted the ideals that only reinforce the moral we learned when we were in elementary school, we are not told anything new, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then he pushed on a kind of ... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) how to defend the common good, given the ridicule about normality and abnormality, right and wrong ... GOOOOOOOOOOD WE GOT IT! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡MATE ALGO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can not, you are bound to endure extremely long gaps when completing the objectives of BULLSH! T as "Run to Helicopter" ....... "Go to group of Troops" ... ... Then, once this has been completed ......... CINEMATIC takes control. ........ You sit there for at least half of the game watching the little scenes of the characters, you are YOU CAN NOT jump, but sit and wait, sometimes when people are not even talking, we sit down and We wait for a helicopter to land. <br /> <br /> Bad game, by a group of programmers laughing! Do not bother doing another one because I'll see the movie!
