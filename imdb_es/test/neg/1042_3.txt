I rented this one by mistake, thinking that it was another movie with the same title, and realizing that I had rented it some time before. <br /> <br /> Fast plot line. A couple formed by an artist and a photographer rents a studio in Los Angeles to Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact that his brother Martin Sheen could ACT. They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is chased by an unpleasant-looking serial killer of the 1930s and his latest victim. Their ghosts live in the couple, first they improve their sexual life, but over time they become more threatening. <br /> <br /> What follows are sex scenes with cheap R-rating, cheaper emotions and a waste of time.
