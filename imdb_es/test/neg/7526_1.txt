H.G. Wells is turning. Without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Actually, this would have been a decent science fiction / adventure movie, if it had not been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simple bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great science fiction story but what many people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they are very young) It is full of social comments. The Eloi and the Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING THAT DECAYS AND DEGENERATES, a satirical blow to Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman ... in the novel, the Eloi are 3-foot-tall children with a mental capacity not much higher than that of an animal. The Time Traveler befriends an Eloi woman, but it is clear that he thinks of her more as a pet, and anyway she is killed before the novel ends. <br /> <br /> This movie first tries to give us a totally stupid background story in terms of "That's why you want to travel through time". The loving romance and the lessons to be learned are enough to make movie fans vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey into the future is marked by a future disaster. Okay, it's not bad, but it would have had more impact if we had been allowed to see that humanity generally degenerates, as in the book. I suppose it is more a reflection of the times, since George Pal's version had a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> The general story? Ugh A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too smart. The UberMorlock is a shame and there is no configuration. He simply appears in time to be killed. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused and in pain. (It was reported that he broke a rib while filming this). He also looks unhealthy and too thin, as if he had been sick for a long time before doing this. <br /> <br /> A sad and sad version of one of the movies. The classics of the world. H. G. Wells deserves something better ... MUCH better. <br /> <br />
