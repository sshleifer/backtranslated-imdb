The cast of EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE returns to follow Disney Pictures, but this time the focus is on Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer Yzma's trusted man (Eartha Kitt). Kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. Things go on happily until Kronk receives the news that his daddy (John Mahoney) will be visiting. Kronk is worried because he knows that his life will not impress his Daddy. One thing he has always wanted and never received is an "approved" from his father. A flurry of mistakes and a gigantic explosion of cheese in the restaurant leaves our friendly hero very much in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from your friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
