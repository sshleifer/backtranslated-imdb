My 15-year-old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable television. As someone who saw The Revenge of the Nerds in a movie theater, I found that this movie is an extremely predictable remake. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy to be able to accurately predict what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be embarrassed to write such an obvious remake of a movie from the early eighties. The title should have been simply "Revenge of the Dorks." Maybe the sequel is Revenge of the Dorks 2.
