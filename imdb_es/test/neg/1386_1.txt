In short, Mind of Mencia is the worst and unfortunate program of Comedy Central, and possibly all television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and I see many shows and movies there all the time, but every time the introduction of this show starts after a good comedy, I can not find the remote control fast enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia account Used, spent racial jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then point out the ethnicity of the one who just spoke at the hearing as if to say "they liked it, so your entire race like, and by extension to me too ". . Give me a break, Mencia, I do not know if those people are plants or not, but just because you go with a black man and give him five for one of your ridiculous jokes does not mean he thinks you're funny. It just means that you put it in the place and what else is it going to do, hit you on TV? It gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful and stimulating, which is evident in his commercials, but when one sees the program, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also states that only intelligent people get some of their jokes, but you do not have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you need to go to third grade, Carlos. The guy goes on to say that he says what others just think, but I think he will find that if someone thought what he says, they discovered on their own that it was ridiculous, and that's why they never said it. first. <br /> <br /> In general, watch 1 episode and finish doing it if necessary, because after having watched 1 episode, you have seen them all. Why Comedy Central continues to renew this horrible show is beyond me. If you are looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere, because you will find very little here.
