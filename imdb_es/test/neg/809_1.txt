I do not see this movie! It's ... repulsive! The beginning is really very good, but in the middle everything falls and I really regret having spent 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket. Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to win people's interest. Horrible image! The only bright spot is the splendid work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you follow my advice ... The image is garbage.
