Useless cartoons not motivated predictable The actors did what they could. The actors clearly indicated that they were ashamed to do this. There is no emotional connection. REAL SEQUENCE OF THE MOVIE "Who are you calling?" (sic) "The police" (sic) "You can not do that, Stevie, hang up the phone" (sic) "Jesse has a lot of money from drugs, you can not involve the police" (sic) "I'm not so sure that stealing money from criminals is a crime, even if they arrest him, at least he will be alive "(sic)" Listen to me, Stevie, this has not been handled well, Jesse is going to end up dead, now that phone hangs up ". (sic) The best friend starts loading weapons Brother: "Hey, what are you doing?" Unanswered. "Hey, I have a family to worry about." (Keep in mind that your child is sitting there watching all this). Then, more and more exhibitions <br /> <br /> Notice how in the previous sequence, at no time does the police say on the other line. "Hello, hello, Uh, we can hear everything you say, we're sending someone there right now." <br /> <br /> Shame on everyone. Ups.
