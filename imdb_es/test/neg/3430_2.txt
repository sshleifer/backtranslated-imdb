Apart from John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was as clichéd as possible, filled with incredibly bad phrases about how their parents would never let them be together and the super looks of longing. None of the "emotions" had depth or reality. The two accented characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever was the weapons expert) ... once they saw how bad the accents were, would not they have decided to just leave them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid? giving the audience headaches? Apparently not. I do not even know where to start with the editing, particularly the sound editing. If you hate obvious duplication as much as I do, do not look at this. That said, Krasinski was great. Outside of the bat, I'll admit that I'm a big Office fanatic and that's why I rented this. But it is quite entertaining as the "friend of the wall with crazy ideas". It has a cliché role, but still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. The end was horrible. Just crush terribly. The idea that the theft went bad had potential, but Keegan falters after being shot, until his study to fall on top of a Chabert painting (which does not look anything like her), is the most cruel scene.
