If you had asked me 1 month ago what this movie was like, I probably would have left most of this, but I am a fan and like any fan I visit movie sites often when Super Troopers came out. I visited that site after it was released on DVD and I was hooked yes, it is a difficult place to maintain, but the good ones are usually like good families that stay together. What a story this troupe / comedy troop has. STARTING people to come and watch movies in the corners, universities, anywhere they can and for free and, after all, develop a large fan base after a few years. decides to close the website that helped them and was created for fans, but worst of all ... DO NOT SAY ANY OF THEM. They just decided they're better than us, they want new fans, not the fans that helped them get where they are ... you know the same fans that begged them years ago. Even so, the smart team that they are, they released the best movie with Super Troopers and they attracted everyone's attention and they thank God for that, because after that they sucked everything else. Well for you, the way to go to the mainstream, just remember that when you realize that your material is not so good and that you have no more fans, you are the ones who eliminated the originals. THE FANS MAKE YOU NOT OTHERWISE AROUND. Never burn your bridges
