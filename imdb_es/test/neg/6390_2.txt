This movie just arrived in Mexico and, as I read very good reviews, I decided to go see it with my friends and my girlfriend, but I was very disappointed, I do not understand how people can rate it 10/10. I mean the script. and the direction was beautiful, but a great movie in general needs a good story of which there is no film. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed several Asian and European dramatic films, but they had a good story, watch this movie at your own risk, unless you are from Eastern Europe or orthodox, I do not think you like it. <br /> <br /> Half of the people in the theater left, including my 4 friends who waited outside because they were so bored, so I was me. I always wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was extremely slow, with a lot of time losing scenes, the total duration of the story could not be shown more than 40 minutes, but they did it longer by having scenes of the monk getting Coal that is like 15 minutes of all movie plus panoramic views and so on, until they turned it into a very boring full-length movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you listen to me if you still see it coming back and rate this comment as useful after the rooms. To help people avoid this waste of money.
