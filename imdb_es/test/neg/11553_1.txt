It is inconceivable to me how ANYONE could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie. I would say it's the worst movie I've seen in years and I see many of them. Maybe I forgot high school? It is also very difficult to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels who performed such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing. It seems that since Dumber did, he got into the tank. Can you believe that he even wrote and directed this garbage?
