Well, before getting into this, let's move on and eliminate the warning: this movie is the quintessential "cinematic" definition of SLEAZE. There are movies out there that can definitely stand out or dislike this movie that have a more valuable artistic path than what can be said for this type of movie. So, what makes it so sordid? Let's take a closer look at "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Made in 1974 for practically nothing, this "roughie" does not have a real "plot" to talk about other thing that portraying what would happen if a FAMILY entered the desert to relax and spend a day being harassed by a fat guy with a ski mask holding a machete in search of kicks ... the kind that end up with everyone forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep. Therefore, those sensitive to issues related to incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. Then, to really add a level of surrealism or simply demonstrate a complete ineptitude for the art of making movies, the "daughter" of the group escapes after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy ( !) tied to a tree branch ("... that fat bitch left me here for 3 days ...") with virtually no explanation! He is saved ... or is he? Of course, no!! They are caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex while forcing the mother to join, and they end up with a dead black guy (courtesy of an ax in the chest) when all is said and done . Then our killer forces the daughter and the mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the machete ....... and the film ends abruptly! A) Yes! No warning, no loose ties ... it just ended. Now there CAN be an appropriate ending to this movie (honestly I do not know), but I've only seen the extremely crude version of Alpha Blue Archives. Your version seems to have the ending either completely cut or that's how it ends. If this was intentional, then in Film-making 101, I'm sure there's a kind of general rule about HOW to finish a movie, but it should not be done like THIS! The fans of the movie "Psycho" should rejoice when listening to the music of the soundtrack, since it is in the whole movie! I would be willing to bet that no right is licensed or anything. Also, even though this is a "violent" movie, there is not much of that, so the gorehounds will not find anything of real use here. None of the violence is shown graphically ... only the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete just above the area of ​​the vagina). Also, sex is the MOST UGLIEST sex I've seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too ugly a film to function as an erotic porn or for anyone who is not a person who has a tendency to like sordid, unpleasant and ugly things, but not violent enough to get a notoriety real for those looking for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other movies like that. The only "notorious" thing about this smoking stack is that the violence was added to an adult movie, a fairly new concept at that time, especially when you consider that chic porn was all the rage and the sieges that filled 42nd Street played things like this one to a group more jaded of experts in pornography. This was not nor is it a "conventional" porn at all. <br /> <br /> If you were in a film school and there was a "do not" list in a movie, this movie would be a brilliant example of that lesson! This cinematic movement demonstrates what happens when filmmakers with brain disabilities are given a "budget" (in this case, probably around $ 142 ... because it looks!) And they ignore all the "do nots" and convert them in "doing" "... yes, this movie is so bad !! One more thing: those who are offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to look at something else." The black man in the film is being verbally abused his color and the killer is obviously racist, but there was NO political correctness in the early 70's. I'm not sure you can make a movie like this today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is not " will surprise "no one or provoke anyone, except those who get away with the ugliness." Actually, I got bored.The sex is so ugly and mundane, it's hard to see with any sense of eroticism, so if you try, You will thank God for the fast-forward button! The "performance", if any is to call it that, it is, at best, amateur (that is, it is even bad for PORN!) with no reason to worry about anyone or anything in this! If you only HAVE to see this anyway, download it, since it will really feel like a heel if you buy this. Some things are simply worthless ... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing more unpleasant than watching this movie would be to see this movie sitting in a theater and watch the other attendees, see it too and suddenly feel insecure. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you fancy a little stupid garbage and, nevertheless, SLEAZY, prove it. It's 54 minutes, and yet, it feels MUCH longer! Crackers would love this! On the other hand, maybe there's something wrong with my search for this in the first place ... LOL! Cavid emptor, lovers of poor quality!
