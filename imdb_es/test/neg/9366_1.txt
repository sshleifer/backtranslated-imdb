From the beginning this film drag and drag. Clumsy overdubs explaining the history, the monochromatic performance, the boring sets, the total lack of any humanity, enthusiasm or style. The actors look like they are drugged. Potentially an interesting story completely wasted. Surely someone realized how bad it was at some point in producing it?
