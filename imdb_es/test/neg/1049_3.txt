The Kite Runner began as one of those "important" films that most people flatter because they are told they should do it if they want to be among the elite and quickly descend to an idiot movie of absurdly extravagant proportions. <br /> <br /> I have never read the book, and I never felt the need because I honestly do not care. I'm sure they call me uninformed to say it, but I really do not care about anything other than "pull your heart, copy all other lines of the story to get thrill from the readers' novel, even if it's set in Afghanistan <br /> <br /> That said, I saw the movie, I heard good things about its beauty, and how moving it was, and I decided why it did not turn out that there was a very good reason not to do it. he was completely unfriendly (I understand, he was young and this is a film about redemption, but, honestly, it was horrible.) I hated him and not in that good "antihero" way, he was just a character. I was lost in self-absorption, but the rest of the story was so absurd that I could not believe that everyone else was guessing about how beautiful it was, how they cried and moved them, I'm sorry, but I'm just moved by something that it feels realistic, you know that science fiction moves me, fantasy too ... but this? Please. This exceeded many other movies for sheer nonsense! My biggest annoyance, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you did not just steal that from another thousand stories? Is it positive that this particular data has not been added to try to tear more tears out of your audience (you know the kind of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie)? I was rolling my eyes when that "turn" was revealed knowing that I could only go downhill from there (not to mention the return to Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOoo, that's not true, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!") Oh, and he certainly did. Filled to the brim with clich√©s and simply plans to tell silly stories. Like "the good guy miraculously escapes the bad boy against all odds with the help of a brave boy who, despite being brutally sodomized and having no idea who you are, is willing to help with a conveniently placed weapon that has a special meaning for you. " Ooh, and do not forget what an idiot, "finally getting revenge on the boy who mocked you when you were little, who, by surprise, has become a psychopathic adult" (believe me guys, I understand that they like to live indirectly through films). but that will never happen. You know, that kid that bothered you in high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) <br /> <br /> Oh, and I must mention the CGI kites! I think they were on par with the films of "Matrix" and "Transformers" bravo, guys! BRAVO! <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made for Western audiences who need a reason to worry about the Middle East (a story of too emotional friendship will work!) This is one of the most superficial films I have had the misfortune to see, it looks like a deep well ... but when you get to that, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the core of the US audience will do what they want. re said and follow the "It's controversial material so it must be good!" way of thinking
