It is a good time machine. It works in "real time" for 96 minutes, but it felt like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were absolutely superfluous. Large amounts of "dead" time in everything. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently, the film was made on a tight budget, I wrote down for its construction the following: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes of the first part of The Lord of the Rings, right? The "scary guy" in charge of controlling the Morloch ... The most frightening thing these guys could think of was someone wearing Gene Simmons: (from the band Kiss) old suits. A little known fact: the monsters of the future have perfectly manicured nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Pass on this.
