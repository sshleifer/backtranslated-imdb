Well, the plot is entertaining but it's full of nonsense. To sum things up, the police / dad wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the transplant from the criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Well, the criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant continued and the police and the police are not allowed to shoot the criminal to save his son. (dead criminal, no transplant, dead son). <br /> <br /> Well, the police in this movie do not have brains, in case you've never heard of a TAZER to bring down the criminal without killing him. End of the movie, as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But when everything is crazy and it is stupid, including the death of 2cops and some doctors who burned quite badly.
