I saw this movie a couple of months ago when it first appeared on the Blockbuster shelves. It's officially the only movie I've wanted to undo watching. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I consider the "ice pirates" one of the best comedies in history. I will also point out that I am a writer and that I met the director / writer of this cinematographic wonder. <br /> <br /> Evaluating the performance: if it were to choose a bright place, It should be noted that Dion Day had an admirable debut as an actor with his role in this. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer, not an actor, so we will forgive him his bad death. Why do not you shoot the shotgun you hold once? Budget? Highlighting the bad performance would take pages, so I stay with the selfish leader, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (who seems to be a chosen name in a comic because it sounded great) has a maximum time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. Their looks are completely fine, but their delivery evokes memories of SNL tearing into soap operas. I guess I could only do a lot with what was written for him, but part of the fault is definitely his. Special effects: it is not my specialty, but for a low budget film, I suppose that the makeup and the weapon game was acceptable. It did not bother me, but it did not impress me either. <br /> <br /> Writing / Directing: The Oscar for the best screenplay is not something that Gerald Nott can ever expect to win. Not only the plot is rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and forced. I understand Hokee's stylized style, but this was just bad writing. What bothered me the most was the theft. Nott stole scenes, shots and Viggo's facial hair from a lot of other movies. The scene in which Russel Crow is walking through the wheat field in Gladiator, whole sequences of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, that kind of thing I just do not like. I will choose not to comment on the shooting because I do not know what it takes to establish a good picture, etc ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not rent this movie, do not even hack that. It's too bad to waste time. Good reviews can be totally false, after meeting Gerry. It seems more likely that he is publishing them himself.
