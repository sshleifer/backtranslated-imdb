I watched this series out of curiosity, wanting to see if they could and with ALL this modern technology, it was the classic epic of Cecil B. DeMille from 1956, starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was disappointed. Yes, they had all the correct biblical characters, but they did not give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that attracted their interest during the first movie. If you're going to have a miniseries, you have to have some "rivotantes" scenes, the "burning bush", parting the "RED Sea", drowning "Pharohs Armies", "building Sethi's Pyramids", could have done today's technology on the scale of highly successful films like "The Lord of the Rings" or Matrix. Obviously, they did not want to leave a DURATION of "faith and sacrifice", which is very necessary in these difficult times.
