Terror in the jungle is a real find. If you saw him, you are one of the lucky few. It's very funny! <br /> <br /> The story is about an airplane that crashes in the middle of the South American jungle. You have to see the scene of the accident to believe it. All die in the accident or are later cooked by crocodiles. Only a blond young man survives. A nearby tribe takes the child to his village and they (all men) venerate him for his golden hair! It is not a joke! In the end, there is much fighting between the natives and the man in search of survivors of the downed plane. All the time, the child sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries without stopping. It's a hoot !!! <br /> <br /> Very dark and contains very questionable subtexts. A must if you like dark movies, it's so bad, it's good.
