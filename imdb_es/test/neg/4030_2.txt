Oh my God, there's simply nothing worse than this! I always love the little science fiction movies that are so stupid that they are funny and I thought it would be one of those, but it was so stupid that I found it absolutely deplorable that they let me out. What were these people thinking? Obviously, they are not real filmmakers, and I really hope that they have returned to their daily work after realizing that this is the best they can do! The performance and the not so special effects did not come close to the standard of the lowest budget B movies. And what about the men disguised as women, could not they find some woman who wanted to appear in this fucking thing? No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give this a "0" if possible, it does not even deserve a "1" for horrible. Do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this horrible loser of a non-movie!
