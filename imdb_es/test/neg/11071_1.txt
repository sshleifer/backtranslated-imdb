I agreed to see this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike of horror films. However, it was not the commotion of a monster that got me out of this movie, it was the horrible performance and the absolutely unpleasant ending. Inside, or the Cave, it has no redeeming qualities: it is poorly made, it has a smiling script, it is terribly bloody and the inclusion of the final free scene disgusts me. No, it's not my dislike of horror films that makes me hate this movie. I have seen such wonderful teen horrors as "House of Wax", it is the fact that the movie leaves you with the terrible realization that by renting the video, you are supporting the creators of Within.
