The story was disjointed, the performance was not of any caliber that can be classified. More of a pilot in series than a real movie. I wanted to like this movie, but I could not find anything that I liked about it. Whatever it was that made the lost children so nice, I was obviously absent here. Although he tried hard. The hooks of the plot were placed clumsily in the middle of what could have been an episode of Dawsons Creek with dark clothes, and the story arc was not going anywhere soon. Very disappointing for me. The final scenes were the convenience of special effects and how the villain of the story planned his entire scheme ... who was trying to fool him (or her), talk about naive. Stay with movies of this type of genre of the eighties, when they had more than one idea.
