Guy Pearce looks and behaves like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding buffaloes because they realize that the buffaloes are also they like In each scene, Guy Pearce seems to be saying: "Look at me, I'm so pretty!" As a hero, his character is a total weakling. In each scene that requires courage, Pearce is left with the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: However, at the end of the movie, this spooky book worm character is left with a pack of Morlocks baboons that can run and jump along the walls (like Spiderman). Almost at the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some kind that destroys an entire valley. Interestingly, even though Pearce and his friend Galgo Mumba are a foot away from the last Morlock who dies; seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe observe how the valley explodes from the safety of its mountain. Now it's fast to run! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. It really makes the movie so much better than it was. Mumba, the model turned into an actress is not very pretty and does not act much in this movie. The scenes that take place in the 20th century lack a real atmosphere. Although the clothes and the vehicles of the time are shown, the characters act as caricatures of how they imagine that in 1900 people walked and talked. The original version of this movie was much better in this regard. The characters of the time were much more realistic, and were much better actors. The original version of this film made the PAST seem like the real basis of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with Emma's death and then do not save her from her fate are very good. The question of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have a large dark butchery full of knives and cutlery, however, they are never seen using weapons, except a dart hit. The giant well full of water and bones is also foolish. Throughout the entire subway, the Morlocks are walking around chewing meaty bones. So, how can all those skeletons be in the hole? It seems that there are some Morlocks that the Bar-B-Que are human and they eat them on the grill, and other Morlocks just like filleted meat. And where are the bathrooms for all these creatures? As I watched the dozens of Morlocks that were piling up on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet and plumbing system, considering that they were throwing many bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see he's looking at his friend, Mandingo. Another totally irritating thing about this movie is the continuous music of LION KING that is in the background. Once Pearce reaches the future (802,710 a.d.); the music of LION KING never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is a singer of African laments (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) who begins to lament and moan about the music of the forest of LION KING . I saw the credits at the end of the movie, and the music in the jungle is not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably investigate this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good effects. See it once, then forget it.
