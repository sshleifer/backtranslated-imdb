Hmmm, it's not a patch on the original Shaw Brothers. The fight is average and it looks very clumsy. The story line is as expected from a 70's Kung Fu movie, confused and stupid. Stupid voices for women, folded in elegant English accents for men. I turned this off early and I love martial arts movies. Get the original, it's much better than this average movie, do not be fooled, I bought the wrong movie, what I wanted was the Shaw brothers movie. I just started commenting. I'm just making martial arts and foreign movies. This is just the beginning of my movie collection. Personally, I own the most modern martial arts movies. I hope you do not waste your time watching this, it's just for the Kung Fu fans of the 70's.
