This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but do not be fooled, it is not at all. There is almost no joke related to weeds that comes to mind, I do not even think they smoke any herbs in this movie. The field of marijuana is simply a plot device. <br /> <br /> My impression after watching this movie was that four friends got bored one summer and decided to write a script full of (their idea of) witty dialogue and making a movie. The product is an anodyne dialogue backed by mediocre performance; To say that this movie does not have 'hook' is a big understatement. Do not waste your time or money.
