I really wanted to see this movie, since everyone was talking about it being a good horror movie and, finally, a European movie. Therefore, maybe my expectations were high. <br /> <br /> It starts with a good silent sequence of horror / shock, but it leaves you on the floor in the following scenes, where you start to present the plot, such as the performance and the motivation / life of the characters it is revealed better than any 'made for TV' drama. It stays like this until the end. <br /> <br /> About the horror part of the film, it's certainly a good idea and a different one, but ALL the scenes are of the 'seen before' type. <br /> <br /> In general, my idea of ​​this film was that it had a good concept, that it was inserted in a mediocre story, bad performance and less than tolerable plot. <br /> <br />
