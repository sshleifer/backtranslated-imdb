I did not know anything about this DVD when I hired it. I took a quick look at the comments here, but I decided to keep an open mind. Obviously an independent film and low budget but that did not worry me. I will watch anything with Derick Jacobi and, as always, he did his part well. What a pity that nobody else did it. I had seen 'Atonement' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In this she seemed to simply appear to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was in the casting of Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his picture on the cover of the DVD, but I did not realize he had the best bill. A sticker was strategically placed on his name! It was observable and I quite liked Dickens's story along with the present. Perhaps, with a more capable actor as a leader, this could have worked better. I was still weak.
