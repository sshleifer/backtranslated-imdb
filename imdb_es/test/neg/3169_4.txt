Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good television director with some good feature films to his credit, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite the performances of Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, such a good cast could not save the film. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you do not see Jake very well and Maggie only does it for 30 seconds when the nanny tells the character of Lithgow about a bust. It's not even a low-key comedy like it intended to be the movie. It just was not funny.
