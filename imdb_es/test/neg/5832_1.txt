I come from Bangladesh, and here, C.C.Costigan is an incredible sex goddess. Leaving aside the jokes, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the Encore: Action channel, when we came across a series of science fiction movies. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad) ... then Judge Dredd, (Stalone almost ruined his career) and then a movie called Lethal Target. One might think that the title "Lethal Objective" could only be granted to a really cool and truly corny imitation of Rambo. But no, what is delivered is what I would like to call a film of "semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-science fiction" ... actually, I think I can say that this is not a movie at all . If it had not been for the heat of the main character, my friend and I would have turned off the movie when the opening credits were shot. <br /> <br /> I have some questions for people (I would not want to). They even dare to say "professionals") who made this movie. -One, in the future, why are you using the weapons we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I understand, it's all you can get your hands on, right? ... well, then, why does the main character wear what looks like a linen shirt and a daily vest? , a little like what people used in the late nineties? .... oh ... I understand ... in space, IT MUST have been a fashion statement ... well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY the main character gets a 3.5 floppy disk in? A point in the movie so she can upload some nonsense? wtf? ... we have progressed so much that we have space travel, but we have not yet advanced beyond the 1.44 megabytes of space ...? <br /> <br /> I guess I'm just asking too much. <br /> <br /> Question two, let's say ... yes ... this is a softcore porn. So, why is there only ONE real sex scene and why does it last 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you're taking the REASON for people to stay in the middle of the night to see this shit (I dare say "movie" anymore?) ... and reduce it to 2 minutes Hell, they should have taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and STILL would have made more money with this "shit" than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is fashionable. And without offending the actress, but she acts as well as I do. and I have mental retardation, and I only have one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... send me an email ... we will have lunch) I would write more, but I have run out of space.
