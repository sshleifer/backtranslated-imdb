I heard this movie for the first time in "Flashback Weekend" in Chicago 2007 for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund was really talking about the movie and it was great in his part of "Hatchet". The same can be said of Tony Todd. Knowing that he is a low budget director / writer for the first time, he offers both the big budget and the remake / reimagination "Holloween" (2007). <br /> <br /> Technically, it falls short in a couple of places The attack on the alligator seen was shooting very dark. When it happened, the dark head of the alligator against the swamp that clung to the black pants became almost invisible. The ambient music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. And like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a weapon, but, of course, shooting the killer is just a pause button for the killer. The end, well, as soon as I saw where he was going, I knew what was going to happen, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we had to meet people and worry about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the protagonist of "Spiral"), the grumpy protagonist, and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and funny man to aspire to during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family") give a convincing reason for Topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by TV regulars (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo "Step by Step") as the oldest couple that you know have no chance, even tour guide Shawn (Parry) Shen) He is a carnalized character. I hope to see more of everyone involved in this movie, but I think it will work better in the home video than in the movies, I'm sorry.
