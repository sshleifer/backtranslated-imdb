This movie has no heart or soul; It's an attempt to get a cult movie from the other directors, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads himself in a kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with garbage and garbage, he is making a statement. But it's not an affirmation ABOUT anything, except the director's shrill cry of "HEY MAKE ME, I AM AN ARTIST, ALSO" But he does not have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory of things that worked, like some of the actors caught in this, from other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid and boring task to sit down.
