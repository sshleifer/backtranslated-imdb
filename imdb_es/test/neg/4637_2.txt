This film has been announced for more than three months in Greece as the largest Greek production in history. Well, it could be, but ... When you hear about a great production, you expect to see something new, something different. What you can see here is a movie without a reason for existence. George Corraface looks like he really did not enjoy making this movie. His performance is so simplistic, it seems almost amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (doubled?), Is full of whistles. Fortunately, few special effects shown by Istanbul and Athens in the late 50s and early 70s are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years old) until 1968 (14 years old), but miraculously he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> A lot for "the greatest Greek production". At least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. And all you get is a love story between 7-year-olds, who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is also a political side. A couple of ironic comments about the Greek "junta" of '67 -'74, so childish that it seems almost forced. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, a couple of good things in the film: most of the actors are great, mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis, the very good stage and the great music of Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: is it such a bad movie? To tell you the truth, I do not know. I only know that at no time does it justify its huge budget (for Greek standards).
