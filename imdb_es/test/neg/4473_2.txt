Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money in a movie, even if they have to keep dragging the stereotypes and placing them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of that and I really believe in my heart that a film like this one is racially irresponsible. The story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who has been conversing with a lady on his computer and, when he finally meets her, turns out to be the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a robust black woman who has no intention of dating Peter, but wants him to see her case where she was convicted of theft. He wants her to leave forever, but she keeps showing up at inappropriate times and, to save her job, reluctantly agrees to analyze the facts related to her case. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter makes his children stay with him and Charlene helps raise them, but suddenly a newsletter News announces that an escaped prisoner named Charlene Morton has escaped from jail. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes sniffing around, but realizes that she is actually innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving. at a good pace and it's a good movie technically speaking, but the script is very unlikely and each character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 movie called "The Landlord" is clearly more in tune with race relations than this disaster . I have always been a big fan of Martin and I think he is one of the most talented people, but he loves to work constantly and, at times, he seems to choose any script that is delivered to him. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifah and the way he bursts into Martin's life is so exaggerated that he instantly becomes charming. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is that the black person in the hip shows a whitish white tense to relax and then transmit a bit of street logic that will help them with their lives. Basically, that's the story, but, of course, they have to let Martin dress in black and act exaggeratedly like a retarded Eminem because Hollywood knows that this is what viewers want. Well, I felt pretty insulted by everything in this movie and it's not because I do not have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood, anyway) I use logic and common sense when I watch a movie. Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levy's speech, but should we really believe that he would be instantly attracted to Latifah? I suppose weird things have happened and how many times a main actor gets shot just to be saved by something in his pocket? Would not a cell phone break if hit by a bullet? Even if you're the toughest fan of Martin and Latifah, I would not recommend it. I know I've said this before, but this is not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
