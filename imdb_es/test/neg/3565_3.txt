This is an extremely boring and slow moving movie. We may feel some sympathy for Tomek uncomfortably and socially and without sexual experience, but Magda's motivations are quite difficult to see, and the ending, at least for me, was inscrutable. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about how we all need love, but it would get more of a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I have been told that the comments should be at least ten lines, so I will add that in the background there are some interesting shots of the relationship between Polish citizens and employees and government institutions. I wonder if he is destined to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, notice the intelligent way in which the men of the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in Magda stove.
