Lina McLaidlaw is a bright and lonely young woman who unexpectedly falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly eligible single with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost immediately, Lina is subject to Johnnie's addiction to lying, gambling and getting into debt. Despite her shortcomings, she is unable to resist her lovely way, until she begins to suspect that he can harbor murderous thoughts towards her ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, well done, with an attractive Cast, a good script and possibly the most lousy ending in the history of the film. Well, that maybe goes too far, but not by much. Many films change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.) but the last two scenes of this are not only horribly lame, but also make the whole preceding plot have no meaning. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by her greed and moral fault, and what she knows about him, to kill her. It should end (as it does in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book before the fact) with him trying to murder her. The reason why he does not do so is that the studio forced Hitch to re-film the finale, one of the first examples of the horrific process of preview hearing tests. Hitch was clever and did as he was told (this was only his third movie in Hollywood) knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would get creative control of his films, as evidenced by his masterpieces of the fifties. But that still leaves us with a final turkey. This is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme. Does anyone really know your husband or wife so well? The script is excellent, with many moments off guard (as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie assumes she is crying for that), a performance by Grant (who never played a villain again) and an excellent picture that culminated in the famous glass of shot milk. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although I personally prefer his confusion and vulnerability in the role of his wife previously victimized in Rebecca. I'd like to rate this movie higher, but I really can not forgive that ending; This is what happens when movies are made for money, not for love, which I suppose is curiously the subject of the film itself. Quickly look for Hitchcock's cameo as a man who publishes a letter.
