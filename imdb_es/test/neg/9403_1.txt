This is, by far, probably the worst movie that Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie did not have a real plot. It is oriented in 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience of this movie is anonymous gambler people. The character of Matt Mcconaughey is not credible enough to be Pacino's protege. So he won some bets for some degenerate clients like a sideline for a shit job in a 900 service. Is that supposed to automatically convince an audience of his abilities? It was just stupid to think. The trailer promised to show us how it performs its safe firing selections, but after reviewing the entire film I still have to see what skill, if any, it ever had. If you want skill, try to see Robert de Niro's character in Casino now that it's a show. At some point in the movie, Mat's character chooses his winning bets by simply flipping a coin. Anyone could do that. Al Pacino seems to talk a lot and I mean blabber mouth in the dialogue of his face. I think that style started with Scent of a Woman and it worked for him because he finally won an Oscar, but now I think it's just annoying. He seems to be always lecturing. He does a bad act of portraying a man who has unstable angina (which is an imminent heart attack), he usually remembers his performance in part 3 of Godather, where he plays the diabetic mafia don corleone, but other than that , the talent of Pacino is wasted in this. movie. Ren√© Russo is simply an eye candy for this movie. He stays in shape and shows it with the tight clothes he is wearing. This movie is pure shit. Do not waste your money on it. It is much worse than the game selections of the Mats character in the movie.
