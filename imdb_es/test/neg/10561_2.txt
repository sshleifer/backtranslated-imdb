Maybe just to laugh at the way my favorite Jane Austen work has been portrayed. Maybe I'm too harsh with this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm predisposed to the A & E version. I can not imagine Darcy played by anyone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed shallow and often forced dialogue. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. His fondness for Wickham was exaggerated, and then his sudden sympathy for Darcy was not credible. <br /> <br /> Darcy was portrayed pretty well, I'll grant it. He managed to maintain the distant attitude that is required, but I felt that he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that make his character so charming, especially in the scene of the proposal. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Bennet also played well, but seemed to lack in many ways. Mrs. Bennet's bad temper was not completely captured in her performance. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins' was a good portrait. Very in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except to say that it is possibly the worst representation of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Other Problems I Saw the few liberties they took with the order of events, such as the presence of Darcy at the first meeting with Lady C., and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not They joined Lizzy in their visit to the Collins. <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. The scene in which Lizzy and Darcy dance loses much of their intensity because you can not get past the feeling that they look uncomfortable on the floor of the ballroom. At least this version of the BBC omitted the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he praised the two for their dance, since they acted very badly. <br /> <br /> There were occasional moments in which he kept me interested. But in general I find that this version is a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie unless you're like me, and these crazy things deviate you too much. <br /> <br />
