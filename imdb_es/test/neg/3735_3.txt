Feeling Minnesota is not really a road movie, but it's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie does not depend mainly on a great story, and since the plot of this film is truly pathetic, it complies with that description. To be interesting, a movie of this type must be based entirely on moving and intriguing characters, and chemistry among them. Unfortunately, the staff at Feeling Minnesota can not produce this emotion. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I can not find out if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in the home of his mother and brother or not. It is said, by his mother (Tuesday Weld), that he must live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters, I never know them. They seem irrational, and there is no real explanation for why they do it. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that I leave the movie without any feeling for the characters, except the dullness and maybe a little touch of attraction for the characters. the cute cameron diaz
