I'm really surprised to see all these positive reviews for this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not that I do not like 'this kind of movies'. <br /> <br /> While I can enjoy a blockbuster Hollywood blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like it. The type of movies "dogma", or "real life movies as they are", IF they are well made. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): there is no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special effects, no extravagant locations. Only a good story combined with an excellent performance and the result is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Does Nine Lives lack dramatic camera angles, special fxs and sophisticated locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is excited about the performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can act as much as you want, but if the story and the dialogue are not credible, the action falls immediately behind. And that is exactly the case with Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> Not once did I have the feeling while watching 'Nine Lives' that I was watching real people engaging in a real conversation. I had the feeling that I was watching the actors trying to look like "real characters" while saying things that a "real person" would never say in these circumstances. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say it's a SPOILER, but there are some dialogue excerpts below. If you think that reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your cinematic experience. STOP READING HERE. If you want to laugh a lot, continue reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? Many of those in 'Nine Lives'. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> Imagine this. Couple visits their rich and disgusting friends in their new mansion. The woman sees the castle of a house and says to her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to this (that is, the expensive house). Man no. Woman: Why not? Could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of that, we are who we are. <br /> <br /> Do you like the sound of that? Her man is acting like an idiot, but she likes the sound of that. Then, an elderly couple passes by them holding hands. This is what the woman comes up with: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived so much. We share everything. I love you <br /> <br /> Are they like children after school? And then the most used clich√© lines in excess you've heard? Ending with 'I love you'? Does she say this while her man is being an idiot with her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NO. In any case, this kind of dialogue made me want to strangle some of the characters in the movie by saying these horrible and horrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> Elderly mom, dad and youngest daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did not realize that Andrew was religious. Mom: it's for comfort. Daughter: It is by force. Mom: life is fleeting. Dad and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHTER. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-line phrase breaks me at any time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> How about the work of the camera? Do not even go there. 'Bored' would be a compliment. It is supposed to look "realistic"; instead, you miss half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing that remains to be seen in this film), while half the time the camera points to someone's back or side instead of face. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, do not say I did not warn you! It is a good movie to rent if you want to go out with your date or something during the movie, because you will not mind if the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overrated and more boring than watching the grass grow, it sums it up a bit.
