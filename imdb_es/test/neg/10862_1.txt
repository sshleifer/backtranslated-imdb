This movie Oh, my God, this movie is so poor, I'm surprised I got to see it all. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that Vinny Jones should only play a period of hooligans in London, which is all. of the story ... <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing that it's almost a comedy ... Hitting on Dennis Hopper and David Carradine did not save this movie ... in fact, I think it's a total comedy and as comedy deserves its 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh, my God, I thought I saw it all when played with Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think that the average viewer will make it Realize that this movie is maybe a kind of movie that will never be ... I can not see how anyone could fall for this crap.
