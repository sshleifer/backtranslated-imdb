I watched this movie for the first time on NBC on Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I do not think it was the kind of Muppet movie that Jim Henson would do. I mean, in the first place, that Pepe uses the word "sexy" from time to time, and Pepe says "would it stink?" And I definitely know that Jim Henson would not let Kermit scream "I WISH I'VE NEVER BORN!" Thirteen times a minute This movie is not like a classic Muppet movie. Of course I can understand that Nicky Holiday stole the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper", but a business woman is cheating the Muppets on a contract for her theater to turn it into a nightclub for smokers. If Jim Henson were here today, he would hate this movie!
