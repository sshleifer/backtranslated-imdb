Of course, it is not supposed to be, but it is. As a small child, I saw this movie in the theater (Being a great fighter and fan of Hulk Hogan). All I remember about the night is that we were the only ones in the theater, and that I really did not like it very much. The rest was dark, and for a good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad movie on par with the greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a movie set in the high stakes world of professional wrestling. Well, maybe the bets are not so high ... and frankly, I feel dirty just call these people "professionals" in anything. And really, except for the first scene, there is no fight to talk about. So I guess the movie is about the world of marginally low stakes amateur fans that hit the C *** - outside of people. It sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the champion of the WWF (Never say that Hulk Hogan was typecast, this and films like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of their talents). Essentially he is playing himself, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than the red and yellow of Hulkster. He also has this gesture with the hand he has. It's a bit like the sign of the ozzy demon that people do at rock concerts, except you put your thumb in the air and make an index finger. My friend stated that it was supposed to look like an "R". Try and see for yourself. If that looks like an "R", well, Mars needs women. But anyway. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his obviously exaggerated detector on the fritz, plays a television executive with his somewhat homoerotic heart set on Rip, who is obviously bigger than Elvis, on his network. He will not have any of that (and leaves the office with a triumphant hand gesture to anyone but the camera), so the film follows Fuller trying to raise the ratings and return to Rip. He does it when he creates his brilliant titled "The Battle of the Hard Boys". Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> From the numerous hand gestures, to the scenes of pretty idiotic fights (Everything played as if the fight is very real and extremely serious) to the overacting, to the too frequent shots of the Hulk in nothing More than underwear, this movie has everything you would ever want in a silly movie. It is frivolous, not too overwhelming for the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "What is that smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic of all times.
