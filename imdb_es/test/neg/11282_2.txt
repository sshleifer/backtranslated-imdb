I came out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that I could not stand to see any longer. As far as the prizes that he won are concerned, those awarded by Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens festival award was to think that somehow a comedy cape was "won in translation" since the subtitles helped to distract attention from the horrific performances. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the screening I attended, the presenter spoke briefly about the history of Turkish cinema and at some point mentioned that primitive Turkish cinema was appropriately called "theater cinema" since many of the filmmakers and The actors involved were people from the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film falls into that category. English speakers who read subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally high language and attribute all the shouting in the movie to that, but observing native observers will immediately notice that all actors present themselves with exaggerated voices. I could attribute it to the amateur nature of all the actors, but the main source of "shouting dialogue" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the film. No wonder his training is in the theater. I suppose that in response to their noisy delivery of lines, all the other amateur actors also raised their voices, thus turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> Put everything on top of all this a story that develops at a snail pace, you get an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that represent completely rural life with uneducated and uneducated characters. From "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films that have been made, Turkish filmmakers seem unable to avoid the attractiveness of the rural area of ​​the country. This is only interesting in small doses and if it is so well orchestrated with excellent writing and direction as in Zugurt Aga. However, most of the time it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing for the native "urban" Turks. Rural communities are a neglected and uneducated part of the country, and while it provides good material for comedy, it has a huge cost to the image of Turkey. <br /> <br /> A member of the Western audience whose only exposure to Turkey is This movie will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish that the filmmakers realize this and leave aside their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and remain loyal to the majority of the country, who live in cities that shame the metropolitan areas of Europe.
