This could be the worst movie I've seen. I knew it was a B movie before I saw it (actually it was the reason to see it), but I never thought it could be so bad. The title promises to Dracula in space and is delivered, however, the story makes no real use of the fact that the character of Casper van Dien is a descendant of Van Helsing. And be careful with the end of the movie, it comes quickly. I've never seen a shout of completion "And now we're over budget!" in a clearer way. However, his resolution of the film was quite funny, the story had been painted in a corner. If you feel you have to see it, look at it with a friend who shares your love for series B movies. If I had not, I would not have reached the end.
