The last sentence of this revision is an important spoiler. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed Joe Dante's work from Piranha. He has done a lot of different genre parodies that were fun and honest. <br /> <br /> But this is pure shit. This is the kind of satire, in line with Thank You For Smoking, which is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a) of what you can laugh at and b) let the audience think. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the plot and the material are very rich, timely and ready for intelligent comments. <br /> <br /> By the way, there's no reason for the main character to shoot the character of Ann Coulter at the scene. End of the movie. It is simply ridiculous.
