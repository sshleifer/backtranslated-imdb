Jane Russell was an underestimated comedian and singer (see SON OF PALACE and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES), but you would never guess it here. A smelly real, produced by Howard Hughes in his successful effort to kill RKO Radio Pictures. <br /> <br /> The movie kills his first chance to show off to sexy Jane when he puts her in a bubble bath. and then chant her chanting "They'll change me (if I'm not going to get hooked)", and everything is downhill from there. In his autobiography, Russell apologized for the number of the movie "Looking for trouble" because it was supposedly so risky: nowadays it can be shown on The Disney Channel. (By the way, that autobiography has an amazing picture of Russell in a bikini, much sexier than anything else.)
