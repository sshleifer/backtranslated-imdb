THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was recorded on video. It presents a passable performance, little lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monstrous effects I've seen. The plot has a university student who is being pressured to join a cult for its attractive owner. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a fun photo for that group if it were not for a silly script and for the low cost of production. The effects of the monsters seem horrible and the quality of the image makes it look like you are watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think anyone who sees this will agree that films should be filmed in a movie.
