This may contain *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where to start in this particular desert? Well, it would have been nice if they really had a plot. Active talent, decent dialogue, suspense, humor, even free sex would have helped this film. Unfortunately, there was only a large amount of blood (even that was not done well), firing automatic weapons and missing. <br /> <br /> There did not seem to be any reason to attach the basic premise, a cursed Native American to protecting the bodies of the tribe he murdered, being tracked down by a Federal Special Operations team that was dressed in civilizations (?) . Most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie, separating yourself from the group so you can be eliminated one by one. You would think that this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappear without a trace. When they finally realize that they are retreating, they make one of several stops and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a lot. The scene of the trees repeats itself incessantly in this film to save money. <br /> <br /> When they are not shooting at the trees, they are following this spirit that leaves no trace, (who knows how they are following it), and spouting many BS males. By the way, did I mention that the majority of this team are women? Interesting to hear them talk hard. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, you can find better movies in the bargain bin in Kmart.
