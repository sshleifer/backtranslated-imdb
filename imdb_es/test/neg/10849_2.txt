As I mentioned in other comments, I became a huge fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The boy is great at martial arts, has some kind of charisma and is a very handsome guy on the screen. Regrettably, he went to the DTV department since his debut and has remained one of the kings of television movies until 2001, where he apparently stopped making movies. Now, one thing is to watch Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which are cliche movies but very funny to watch (because they are entertaining if that has some meaning) but another thing is to see an insipid boredom like Total Reality. I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung that this guy made. I would not recommend it to even the biggest fans of Bradly Hardcore. If I had known this and the crisis was going to be so fucked up, I would not have spent the 3 or 4 euros that cost me. The total reality is as boring as the crisis, although curiously, it begins to promise. A group of military prisoners in the future are given the opportunity to stop some kind of disaster in the past (sorry, I really did not pay much attention to this atrocity) and they only have 24 hours to return or something like that. how that. If they do not, they are stranded there forever. The poor director who supervised this, "tries" some comic clich√©s (?) Like the convicts who come to Earth and do not know what a truck is (for example, hilarious ...). The film continues with David Bradley along with a girl from Earth for the rest of the movie. This bored me so much that I had to force myself to see it in 3 or 4 installments to at least make use of the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. That's because every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley with only one scene of a 10-second shit fight in it, then that's the final touch that would help you throw him into a hundred-foot precipice to never see him again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile of poop in the street and I swear to God I would ask him to return me for my 5 euros. I would also love to meet David Bradley to ask him why, in the name of God, he chose to star in this poor excuse for a movie. Do not even bother with this movie, I say it from the bottom of my heart, not rent it out and especially not buy it.
