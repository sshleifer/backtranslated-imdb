First, let me say that those of you who voted "10" are just fooling themselves and trying to get the votes at a respectable level ... something that this movie does not deserve. (The only films that deserve a 10 IMO are the classic ones ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. Look at the best rated films of all time for the complete list.) I also noticed that many people gave a positive vote to this for being so realistic. As for what is inside a cave. Although I would have to agree with them in the environment, they are simply not rating the film as a whole ... they are fascinated by the environment but the overall review is lost. It would be like I voted 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the scenes on the beach remind me of what the Florida Keys look like ... although that may be true, it does not deserve the film. a 10 because the film as a whole was rancid. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie, as usually if one thing stinks in a horror movie, another thing takes up or compensates for the weakness. (For example, bad actors are overshadowed by a large plot and / or by the great work and the stage of the camera). We started the DVD and everything started quite normal. We started joking about who would be the first to die ... after a brief trip by car and hiking, they camped for the night. At that moment, I typed some things that really made me disconnect the rest of the movie. Two main problems I had: bad effects and an even worse story. The first thing we noticed was that the fires were not real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or false flames in which they were all sitting. For a horror movie to have such an obvious effect, you should have told me what I was in during the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only a few minutes later, I was shown how badly written this movie was. I do not remember exactly how they got to the point, but basically, we discovered that the "Symbolic Nerd" is writing a book about cave exploration, etc. Another member of the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates to say that "I do not want this story in your book". The author convinces and convinces the other that he will not include the story in his book and that he can trust it. (A direct quote: "If I tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book"). At this point, I was expecting a good story of more than 5 minutes, complete with flashbacks and a heartfelt performance. What I got was a short, miscommunicated (and acted) statement. I say statement because what he ended up saying was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I do not remember the exact quotes, but basically it says: "We were in a cave, the cave was flooded, a girl died when our friend saw her drown." You may think I'm overreacting and being very critical, but that's not far from a direct line-by-line quote from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> For the next 50 minutes or so, the movie takes place in the cave and although the lighting is what I imagine it would be in a cave, I really could have done it without the blur / blur of the movie, and the camera shake is just one that I did not. go for. (I have a really good vision, and after seeing the main parts of the movie, I felt I was legally blind). I was emotionally detached from this movie, so the parts that probably should have been scared were not. Maybe if I could have missed the very slow start and bad performance of this movie, at least it would have scared me, but I do not remember anyone in the dark room who moved in any of the "action" scenes. /> <br /> The last scene was probably one that I'll never forget, and that's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped in a nude room. The "monster" comes to attack / kill women ... stops when he sees a picture of a small child. A flashback occurs in which we discover that the "monster" was injured when he was a small child and spent his whole life in the cave. Cut to the present, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). He looks at the photo and the two women seem to have found the weakness / weakness of the caveman. At that moment, he stabs and kills a girl, then proceeds to rape the other woman, quite graphically. After about 30 seconds of watching the camera shake and shake while violating it, passes the credits, the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had to do it all and wasted money on renting this movie, I could have saved an hour and seen the first scene and the last scene of this movie and still I've gone with the same thoughts that I have now. <br /> <br /> Those of you who compare this to Blair Witch are very similar outside ... if any of you had read how the director and the writer directed the shooting of Blair you would realize how revolutionary he was. ... give each cast member a script on the day / night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is a genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb would allow me, I would get a negative score ... I do not understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
