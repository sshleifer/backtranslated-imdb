Well, the end of the story is: all the deaths were a joke about the main character and nobody is really dead. Yes, I know that Cry Wolf did it and he did it well, but this is not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap". Although the "characters" apparently do not die, we see them die stabbed (and other ways to kill them) even though these "murders" are NOT carried out as anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you are going to show people that you are being killed, someone needs to see you, if they are not in the camera and the character is being killed it just does not work, and until the end I liked a couple of scenes but you final ruined everything. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (especially the child at the beginning who really believes he cheated on his friends by making them believe they were playing with the brains of his dead grandmothers) the script is less The half reason why he I gave this movie a 3 is because a) they really did something b) they threw it and c) they filmed in the movie Yes, you read it right, they wasted (at least) $ 5,000 in movies for this shit. Sad, if they had filmed DV, they would have some money for a better cast and another writer to review the script and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director did something (as most do not), but HATWE the fact that he comes to IMDFB talking about how "original" the movie is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it, It could be a fun movie to borrow.
