This was the worst movie I've seen in my life. I must admit that I did not see it from beginning to end, since cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. <br /> <br /> The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've seen, neither funny nor attractive. In fact, spooky and unpleasant are too complimentary. <br /> <br /> It's painful to watch, there's no acting, especially not from the star who behaves like a mentally deficient doping who takes off one of those black actors with his mouth open. <br /> <br /> As horrible as it is to see one of them not being able to shut up the black actors, seeing a Puerto Rican is even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is descriptive, it is the plague. This movie is a must see.
