I broke my own rule by buying this movie from the $ 5.88 bin at Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star, and you've never heard it, it's for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason is because it SUCKED! They shine the photo and the name of Sandra Bullock on the cover of the DVD as bait, and this caused this little fisherman. I was thinking about donating the record to a charity or giving it to the library, but I do not think so. I would like to submit someone else in the world to this movie. Worst lines: "What do you mean army friends?" "What do you mean with your dad?"
