The heart of darkness was terrible. The novel was difficult enough to understand, but when a producer decides to release a movie based on it, it messes up everyone. Not only those responsible decided to change certain characters and completely eliminate others, but the performance was horrible and the general impression I got from the film was that it was a complete failure. I watched the movie in the hope of understanding the novel a bit better, but it simply misled me and my classmates. I think the movie was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially when he has awesome movies like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs to his credit. The same with the great John Malkovich.
