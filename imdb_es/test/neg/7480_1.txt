Before Last Call w / Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate broadcasted much more valuable shows after Late Night w / Conan, such as Second City TV, 3rd Rock From the Sun and Carline in the City repeats, and some of them in the comedy. These days there is nothing worth seeing because all I can see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> In his program on June 21, he tried to use the Internet. Meme called "Rickroll" on his show. He failed hard. That event confirms that Carson Daly is horrible.
