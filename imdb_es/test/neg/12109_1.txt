Even to say that this movie is Sebastien's work at its best, just tell him everything you have to know about man. Sebastien is a pathetic, silly host, not very funny, but very popular on French television. If watching any of his programs is simply torture for any normally constituted human being, his first film (and let's just hope) was the worst. Sebastien's apology for rape (the victim falls in love with his assailant) is not only out of place, it is totally unacceptable. I suggest you do not bother taking a look at this image (or any of Sebastien's future characteristics), it would simply waste your time ... There's something on French television that does not smell good ... and this is Patrick Sebastien! !!
