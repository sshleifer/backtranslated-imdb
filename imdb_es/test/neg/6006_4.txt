This movie really was poor. I went to the theater expecting something exciting and, instead, I had the opportunity to perfect my skills to "guess the next turn of the plot before it happens". Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon for everyone to see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the gore was met with such a complete suspension of the belief that it really did not add up much. <br /> <br /> The excessive wise cracking and the talk of police at crime scenes made it seem all the more false And the scene in which the character of Lambert fights the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" does everything possible to indicate the expected level of intellect of the audience: little. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the treatment of the "X-Files": all the buildings of the film, be it the police station building, a house at noon or a hospital, they suffered from a lack of perceptible illumination (not to mention the lack of "patients"). 'in the case of the hospital). I do not remember a single scene when someone turned on a light switch. It sure would have been good. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is not really an Oscar-grade actor, so I guess you have to take this movie for what it's worth. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after seeing "The Warriors". Otherwise, you stay with an effort that is boring and unoriginal, and nowhere near the movie genre like "Silence of the Lambs."
