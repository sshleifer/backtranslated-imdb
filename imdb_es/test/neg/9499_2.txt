I do not know where to start. Maybe the whole idea of ​​this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing humor about a kidnapping. I do not know what was more offensive: the theme or the "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull cut its penis, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra that is not the kidnapping of their son to show (like, I do not know, his TALENT AS SINGER !!!!). Your family should not have to relive that horror. Thank God, it was shown on HBO and it did not open in theaters. Please, do not look at this if you have self-esteem.
