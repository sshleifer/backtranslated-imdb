First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, having said that, I can not say it was a "good" movie. I entered the theater with very low expectations (something I learned to do). I'm glad I did, because the plot and the development were not stellar. The jokes were of low grade humor. But, I was in the right mindset to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed out loud. I did not hear anyone complain after the movie came to an end. I even saw a boy fall from his chair laughing! But, once again, I must warn you that Grandma's Boy is NOT a movie of the best quality. It's a funny movie (although low), and if you choose the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and do not take the children.
