Two films: "The fifth element", "Armageddon". The same theme: save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is far inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects can not hide a laborious and conventional script worldwide. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think of the president's speech and especially of Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace." At the beginning of the film, he tends to neglect and overprotect her, which makes her feel tired. Then, at the end of the film, it is the true love and understanding that shine in him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the film tries to be fun, but the result does not work, since the humor introduced in the film is often raw and low level, while in the "fifth element", the humor was bizarre, involuntary and allowed ignore the serious side of the action. The film suffers from two other disadvantages: it often falls into ridicule (the Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are misused. Bruce Willis is the complete opposite of the character of his "fifth element". He plays man, ruins him and, at times, is unbearable. The other actors are hardly credible in their own roles, in particular, the sinking team of Willis. It seems that this crew is here just to have fun. One of them is taken for being very qualified, but it seems a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She is at NASA to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film premiered in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed his weariness of saving the world. His tiredness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
