What a bad movie, the premise was everything there, the actors were all there. And yet, there was a lack of a credible plot, a good dialogue, the characters with whom they were related. <br /> <br /> The typical premise was wrong in a context in which all men were attacked by the system. The main character, Tye, and his little brother, have not had any luck and their house is going to be recovered, along with godfather Matt Dillon (who does not seem much older than Tye, so he's not sure how that happened) rescue with a plan. steal money from an armored truck in which they work as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with consciousness, but decides to accept it. And so begins a truly terrible hole, filled with 30 minutes of incredible garbage. I'm not going to list all the ways this movie was not realistic, but let me point out the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because Tye decided to be a good guy because a homeless person became a collateral damage, all his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather, who is supposedly from the family and the man who took him to the caper at the last moment to help him, dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of frustrating his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was recovering his house. And yet, he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There are many more, it goes without saying that this movie was very bad and I sincerely hope that no one else will see it.
