The biggest problem with "In Search of Jesus Historical" is that there is very little search. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and only in the 1980s, which included interviews with "experts" and discussions about "science" and "facts" to defend the title of the film. with money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the "historical Jesus" is really little more than a dramatization of the life of Christ in the third category. Unlike Shick-Sunn's "In Search of Noah's Ark," which spends most of its execution time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where it could be, this movie is basically the story of Jesus without effort. Made to prove or disprove its existence. The famous Turrin Shroud is mentioned, but a little more detective work has a lot of screen time. <br /> <br /> For the fans of these almost documentary films like "The threat of Jupiter" and "In search of Bigfoot", etc. , this movie does not offer much.
