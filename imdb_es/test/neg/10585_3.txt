When a losing teenager is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly ... <br /> <br /> The superhero movie is the last fake movie that hits the screens. However, unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with the Airplane films! Top Secret and The Naked Gun), he is still to blame for most of the recent skits ... he is mostly more foolish What fun! The fault lies mainly in the gags. It just is not fun enough. Some of the jokes work, like the nail gun scene, but other parts just fall down. The parody of the X-men, for example, or the whole sequence of farts. Burning chairs this is not! One of the key things about the best fake films, like Airplane, is that although the dialogue is extremely fun, the cast for the most part is completely straight. This makes it even more fun. Even when there is a simple dialogue in the foreground, there may be fun things that happen behind the cast. Again fun The other key is that everyone has a kind of plot, to hang on gags. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from several movies, THEN, try and fake them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films rarely exists. Another flaw that these films have is that some of the scenes were really fun in the original versions, and in most cases, even more fun than the parody scene! The cast tries to get into the required spirit, but with a lot of dialogue and scenes without grace, it is difficult to worry about it. <br /> <br /> As the recent parody movies are going, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the horrible Meet The Spartans, but considering that some of the people involved here have made good and funny movies In the past, it is not good enough.
