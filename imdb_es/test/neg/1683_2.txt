I jumped for joy knowing that this show ended. The characters in this show were extremely irritating. None of them had a singer who redeems the quality. Damon Wayans is probably the most bearable. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She is as annoying as she was in Martin. <br /> <br /> Children are also very annoying. The older one is an idiot, the older one is a stagnant brat and the younger one is frustrating to listen to. <br /> <br /> I guess I liked the smart kid. But that's it. <br /> <br /> He did the world a favor by finishing. <br /> <br /> Pray that a Wayan will never star in another show ... NEVER.
