This is truly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who plays the intrepid grandfather, Charlie, is in full overexpression mode, hoping that the more striking it is, the better its performance (buzzing tone sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last legends of cinema and to see it in this movie (although End of Days is the second worst movie I've seen in my life) is really heartbreaking. From the bad story to the non-existent address, it is clear that the only reason why this movie was made was that the producer's name ended up in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, really hysterical. Find the flashback scene where Rod is, where there is a Jor-El Superman wig and a big black mustache of porn. It is only expected that his follow-up film, I Believe in America, by Uber producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem it and leave a good flavor on everyone's lips.
