A Time To Kill is based on the first novel by John Grisham, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that did not shoot to fame. (That would be achieved by "The Firm"). That's why this movie was not made until much later, after Grisham left to produce meaningless books with the dollar signs of the movie in his head. Unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. He had flesh, weight and heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw translates to the movie. Namely, "A Time to Kill" prepares you. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson), prosecuted for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old son. daughter. We have a non-favorite lawyer (McConaughey) who fights the big bad system to save his client. And, by the way, it's all in the context of racism in Mississippi, with hooded KKK men burning crosses. <br /> <br /> In other words, we're supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We are supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We are supposed to feel the injustice of a system in which a racist jury composed of whites could judge a black man who was trying to avenge a brutal crime. We are supposed to feel that we are next to the people who sing "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the issue of racism is a smokescreen, and everything is hatched. Carl Lee Hailey was a watchman. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances for what he did, but the fact is that he was not innocent. This would have been true regardless of the color of their skin, or the skin color of their daughter's assailants, the judge, the jury or any other person. <br /> <br /> And what is so heavy about this film is that it paints that anyone who believes that Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you think the law should not be taken into the hands of the people, then you could be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere with a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time that a great deal of sentimentality is inserted in a story like this, and it will not be the last. As a movie, A Time to Kill remains fairly faithful to the book, and acting is not that bad. But he played the hand that had been handed out, really. Even a good cast can not raise material from bad sources.
