This, in my opinion, is a very bad movie that announces Arnold Schwarzenegger as the protagonist (despite being the co-star) only to sell more copies. Obviously, taking influence from the films of "Conan" of similar theme, this movie is not so pleasant and finally fails to entertain anyone. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen plays Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given incredible strength by a ghostly figure after her village was ransacked, her family was killed and she herself was raped by soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants to control the barbarian world and looks for a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do it. After discovering what has happened, Sonja throws herself into revenge and, at the same time, must save the world from Gedran's wrath. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, intends to protect her whether she wants it or not. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this movie is the beginning. The events prior to the point at which Sonja receives her powers could have easily made between ten and fifteen minutes of pleasant film. However, the beginnings rush to what appears to be a quick 'Previously in ??.' Segment of a television program. If they had made these events part of the story and had eliminated some of the filler later on, they could have started redeeming this film, but unfortunately they did not (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer has only currently directed two films since Red Sonja). <br /> <br /> This movie also features some of the most annoying characters in history like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and just adds an excess of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case it fails miserably. Obviously, it was written in the film to get some comic relief, but with the general absurdity of the film, anyway, this was another costly mistake for "Red Sonja". <br /> <br /> Despite all its shortcomings, there was a good fight. scenes that involve both Neilsen and Arnie, which are worthy of mention but are not enough to save this turkey. The acting is as good as it looks for movies of this quality, and even Arnie did not seem too upset by his performance. I do not recommend this movie at all; For me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for "Red Sonja"? 3/10
