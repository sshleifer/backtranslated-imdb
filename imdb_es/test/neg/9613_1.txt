Received with ridicule by most critics when it first appeared, 'Frenzy' has recently made the rounds of UK television. I remember seeing it in its original version, and thinking that if Hitchcock wanted to show some kind of confession on the screen about his ingrained misogynist, he could not have found a more unpleasant little vehicle to do it. <br /> <br /> But Time alters the perspective, so that what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 could, all these years later, be worthy of an ascending reevaluation. <br /> <br /> They could. . . but no. 'Frenzy' is scum. The scum of an aging director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of the 70s film without seeming to realize that freedom imposes its own obligations, in particular, the need to bring integrity to work. <br /> <br /> There is none here And there is not much evidence of the brilliance of the previous address, the change from an implicit tickle to explicit hateful is not surprising nor, for a supreme, elegant stylist: it is simply banal (the scene of the prolonged murder is just that: prolonged, without rhythm, without reason, with no other purpose than the cheapest of management's desires to appear as a contemporary artist as, say, that other acclaimed inexpensive cheap practitioner, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> And it goes from bad to worse, with a dialogue that challenges any human origin (no less important in the ridiculous deviation to the Home Life of our beloved wood inspector and the kitchen of his wife) . <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best summarizes 'Frenzy' (and lasts as the most explicit accusation of the person of Hitchcock) is the exchange of things between two lawyers in a bar, where they discuss the serial murders and then agree that at least women had a good time first when raped. <br /> <br /> I remember my disgust in that scene goes back to '72 and is not cut out yet, because it was not about Hitchcock being smart or sardonic, or trying to make some universal point (the big issues, the big ones truths were not Hitchcock's strength, nor personal preference). just Hitchcock, allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror in life to shine through the texture of the film. <br /> <br /> Calling Hitchcock's last great masterpiece of 'Frenzy' is betraying little or no understanding of what Hitchcock really accomplished in the way of cinematic tricks, cinematic emotions and dazzling cinematic mastery. . <br /> <br /> 'Frenzy' is, therefore, what it always was: a cheap, nasty movie with a closed fist that was useless. anyone involved, or to the memory of a filmmaker who really was, in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest that ever existed.
