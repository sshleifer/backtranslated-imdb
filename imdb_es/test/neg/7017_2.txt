I'm a big fan of "Aunt Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She really was the perfect actress to play that character. <br /> <br /> I heard that Angela Lansbury was very good on the stage of "Mame" but it is hard to imagine someone beating Rosalind Russell. <br /> <br /> Lucy was such a great comedian that her comedic parts saved her performance in this film in which I think it was a disgrace. Actually, they should have nicknamed their singing voice: listening to these songs sung at a faster pace and with loud voices really changes everything. effect. <br /> <br /> I just saw the reactivation on stage in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris, Frasier's nasty smoking agent, she played Vera and she was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Both would be a good casting for a television movie of this program. Maybe if that production reaches Broadway, consider filming it. <br /> <br /> I also believe that Tracy Ullman would be as good as Agnes.
