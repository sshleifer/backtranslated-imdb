'Ernest Guarda la Navidad' is the special Christmas movie by comedian Ernest. In this film, Ernest has to find a successor of Santa Claus to continue Christmas. On the way, he meets a young woman who is a thief and ends up stealing something very important from Santa (I will not tell you what that is, you only have to see the movie for yourself). Like most of Ernest's movies, there's a lot of slapstick humor involved. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best movies. It's fun and has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not be afraid to show love. It is not the best Christmas movie, but it is a good idea to put yourself in the Christmas spirit. It's a bit sad that the movie is a little outdated now.
