This movie was really fun even though it was not meant to be! The acting was stupid and also the voices. Almost everything was a guy who walked through a corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw in this super stupid natural thing that made it even dumber. It was not even like a normal movie, this strange and spooky music was playing for almost the entire movie. What's up with the corn maze horror movies? The children of the corn scared me a lot, I thought, and I thought this would be something like that, but in reality it was stupid. The main character just walked aimlessly screaming for these two girls. And then at the end he likes to kill someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's so funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, do not waste your time.
