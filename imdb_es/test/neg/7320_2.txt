I had high hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD, "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After suffering this, I realized that I simply lost $ 2.50 to rent it. This film began slowly and became slower ... brief and fleeting moments of lightness showed that it was in the spirit of American Pie if you refer to the "spirit" as something dead. It is not very entertaining or fun! Do not be fooled like I did and expect something that can not be seen, as this movie will depress you rather than entertain you. "I need to fill three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve the effort ... what a stupid piece of ignorance ... This movie broke down, even the brief nudity stunk!
