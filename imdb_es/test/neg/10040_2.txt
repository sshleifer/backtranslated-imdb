The filmmaker remained faithful to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894, which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) entitled "Our family problem". Know that this is the only story of an eyewitness ever written. The filmmaker must be accredited for its accuracy, but there is little to say about the quality of production and acting. The performance was theatrical and the quality of sound and image was extremely poor. It seems that the filmmaker simply filmed scenes of the informed events that took place without incorporating them or weaving them into a plot or plot that flows. If you must know the history, read it, it is much more exciting and conclusive.
