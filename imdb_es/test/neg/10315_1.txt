This movie stinks more than Limburgish cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! I love Sandra Bullock and, however, I HATE THIS MOVIE ... Although embarrassed, I do have a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play with the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this. They interpret it like "A film of Sandra Bullock". She only has a small part in the whole movie and does everything she can with that, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
