This cozy middle-class comedy became the subject of much hatred on the part of the new generation of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Did he deserve such malice? Well, Terry and June were never smart, it was never a well written story with different threads that intersect in the conclusion. It was the show your mother and father saw and probably grandparents. They laughed instead of laughing, but were never offended by the show, so the fact that he never challenged them was irrelevant. <br /> <br /> One Foot In The Grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight. to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after the death of Terry Scott, an episode was broadcast on terrestrial television, and that has been his final exit. There have been few repetitions of the program on any television channel. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the television comedy has advanced from Terry and June. It's hard to find kind words, Terry Scott made the best of weak scripts.
