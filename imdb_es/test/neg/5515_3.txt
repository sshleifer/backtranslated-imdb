It took me a few years to hunt this title, one of the main elements of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video store selected the Space Raiders and I saw them three times each time my mother rented them to me. I guess it was my Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a shame it's so stinky. My memories were so nebulous that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia, so I had to take it seriously. A group of space pirates accidentally kidnapped a very annoying child and spent the rest of the movie trying to take it home. -up, recycled special effects, wobbly sets and bad acting. But even with the unintentional comedy, it's not fun to see her as an adult, where I can distinguish not only the technical flaws, but I wonder how spectacularly the writer and director managed to blow up an endless stream of fun and powerful moments. They have been seen in a million other science fiction movies and in the hands of any remotely competent person they should have been successful. <br /> <br /> I imagine that when I was a child I probably found it quite empowering, there's a lot of "I can not do this, I'm just a child" "Of course you can joke, you just have to try!" - type exchanges; the child drinks beer, etc., but even by the low budget sci-fi standards of 1983, this is pretty horrible, with a real dream of an "ending".
