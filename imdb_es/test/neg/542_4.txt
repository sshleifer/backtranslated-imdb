First of all, I just want to say that I am a big Naruto fan. I love anime and manga stories. In addition, the first film has just confirmed that Naruto has to do with fun, great action, great story, ... But then the second movie came. I was very excited because the first movie was great. But it did not satisfy me a bit ... The story was boring, the action was not so good ... especially compared to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of the animation. I found it very bad ... Could the story be slower ... ANY ??? Where is Naruto's kyuubi? Not once does he become a demon ... I mean ... My advice is ... to see the series (until episode 140, then they're just stuffed) and then read Manga because it's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> In general, I gave it a 4, just because it's Naruto ...
