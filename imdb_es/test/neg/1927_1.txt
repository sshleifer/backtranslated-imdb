I watched this movie to see which direction one of the most promising young talents in the movies was going. Unfortunately, with this film, Leelee Sobieski has chosen a path not only well used, but completely free of any meaningful destiny. This movie used all the tricks of the book to get out of the screen, touch you on the shoulder and politely ask if it is possible for you to have the laces of the heart so that you can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer feels the love represented on the screen. During the emotional climax of this movie, I laughed. To be honest. To save you time and money, I would suggest that, instead of watching this movie, eat Karo Syrup and Velveeta. Is the same.
