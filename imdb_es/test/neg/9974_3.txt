This original HBO is quite simple and quite silly. Armand Assante, once again making a bad imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman, an ex-con who has just been released on parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy has connected with the unconditional Elliot, played by Sam Neill. To complicate things further, Ray's old friends at Cell want some favors and kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot unite, despite mutual disgust. <br /> <br /> What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win the Oscar in the future, not so polished here, but her emotion is raw Sincerity and some pretty naked scenes Explicit ones make it worthwhile to see this. Almost. <br /> <br /> Rent "Fever" (not the title does not fit the movie) if you are a fan of it, otherwise, skip and appreciate that the stars have achieved better things. <br /> <br /> Note: this is a difficult "R" movie for language, violence and nudity.
