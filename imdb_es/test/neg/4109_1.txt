I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump to the moment I considered watching this movie and making other plans instead. I saw a free projection of A Sound of Thunder, so I can not complain about the price, but I would like to get my 103 minutes back. The acting was mediocre, and the special effects were deplorable. People should not make movies about dinosaurs if they can not afford to make prehistoric creatures look as good or better than Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only savior of the movie. I noticed that women under 18 rated the film as the highest, and the only explanation is that they ate Burns with their eyes all the time. All the length of 103 minutes. This movie should have finished in about 80 minutes. He simply crawled and went on and on. Do not waste your time or your money in this crazy movie.
