<br /> <br /> Very slow and laborious film with a confusing plot. The film's only hope of keeping the public interested is the free nudity released at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is moody and her appearance does not hold when she is on the screen with Peta Wilson, who is much younger. I'm not sure what this movie was.
