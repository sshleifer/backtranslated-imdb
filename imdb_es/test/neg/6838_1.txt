Spoilers !! Will Bruce Willis, the funny, part-time comedian, play a Hispanic murderer nicknamed an African treasure prairie dog? I guess all the good Spanish nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Razor (blade), etc. were not available? And why would any South American murderer know a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army? The last time I verified it, the IRA is not looking to open any branch offices in South America. And why does an Irish terrorist, hard of the prison and tired of the battle, look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought that maybe this movie was going to be a parody of "The Crying Game" when the character of Gere was introduced as the person who was going to hunt "The Jackal". What a bad casting! And why would the FBI hire depraved terrorists to track down the murderers? It seems that a terrorist is going to mass destruction, and a murderer usually hits a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only person who has seen Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought that this movie was supposed to be a new version of the great movie "Day of the Jackal", but this movie is just a dumbest version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both films are really silly, and part of the stupidity is the fact that, as an audience, we are forced to see Bruce Willis go over his routines and we should say "Wow, is not he smart?" THE PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better movie about murderers. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who can be paid to stand up looking good and pretending to be smart. "The Jackal" is so poor, I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme making appearances as "other" assassins or FBI. It goes without saying that "The Jackal" has eluded the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere goes to work, it's only a few days before "The Jackal" is ready! I suppose the positive message of this film is: "Thanks to the terrorists, our streets are safe from the murderers". In general, the "Jackal" has no redeeming qualities.
