Well, Herc is a piece ... but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted, they were wasted ... oh, humanity! <br /> <br /> Poor Sean Astin had to follow his teacher to the very hills of New Zealand that ... wait! Could be? Someone on the production team of The Lord of the Rings was making home movies in his spare time! If that is all! <br /> <br /> I wish I could at least say that it was promising. <br /> <br /> Special effects are often ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But, Herc was A piece. <br /> <br /> NH
