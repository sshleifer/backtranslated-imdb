This movie was so stupid and slow that it was once slow. The only good part of the movie was the girl in the tight shiny gold pants. There was no gore whatsover and what is a horror movie of the 80s without a bit of gore. Besides, the killer did not scare the murders at all. But if you like watching the worst horror movie in the world, then this is for you. Do not waste your time like I did watching this.
