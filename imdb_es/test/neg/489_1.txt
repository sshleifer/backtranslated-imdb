Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if they did not drop you in the head when you were a kid and then you used it as a soccer ball, then you will agree with me that this is one of the worst series and fun that have been made. Around a woman who as a child was beaten by her father, who also killed her mother, spends her time drawing, but waits, then turns into her superhero drawings and continues to fight crime, therefore, she is "attracted by the pain". "So clever, the story itself is fine, but it's like that, Jesse, the writer and director, has no idea how to write a script, he just listens to a monologue with the 8-year-old hero's version and it seems that it was written by a 30-year-old man, while his father, who has a big mustache, walks around the house all day while he looks angry, only shows how bad the characterization is, especially the part he gets angry in the first episode and begins to repeat the phrase "no more" while holding the head of his wife before killing her using the marble work surface.The following explosion sound effect and his terrible performance as all he can convey is anger, it is bright even after going to hit his daughter with his belt, he does everything with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion.The episodes themselves could easily contain a good clean script covering more than 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse n or wants this, little Jesse, is shitting postmodernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko and then committed suicide. The useless idiots of the camera, all at odd angles, repeatedly repeated lines and even nonsense sequences, are confused from time to time to fill up episodes that are too long. In conclusion, the idea is not bad, it's just how it's done, there's also a great character of a fat guy on a bench who does not raise enough and it's great, I just want to hug his chubby Lil cheeks because they look so smooth. The development of the character does not exist, since the main character simply says the first thing that sounds philosophical that comes to mind, although all contradict each other. But in general, mainly s ** t <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4, however, is much better. Write "Jeeharv" on your tube too, the results can make you cry for the beauty of the world too. You will hear many cheap sex jokes, mostly homosexuals.
