After the moving story of Kenneth Opel on the revitalization of the pleasure of reading in elementary school, I had high hopes in this series. The story of a non-favorite bat who travels all over the country to join his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my growing imagination. At the time of listening to this series, I started looking at the Bardel Animation site and I liked what I saw. The character's design looked impressive and the fast-paced plot seemed to have spread respectably in an arc of thirteen episodes. I was very disappointed, then, when I decided to watch a replay in the early morning. <br /> <br /> The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, chasing a tiger moth in the depths of the night. Listening to an ecolocatory song, we see that an ingenious CGI effect in the raw illuminates the moth, and the pursuit takes a frantic turn while the little insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself that deceive its persecutor. As a lover of biology, I had a decent understanding of established principles (tiger moths can feel the sounds their predators use for echolocation and sonic coverage for themselves) but without that exposure, I would surely have missed it. A small objection, I thought. Surely the director will fill us a moment. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> Once our protagonist hugs with some of his companions, we are presented with the most boring dialogue I have seen on television. Chinook, Shade's childhood rival, starts mocking the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines I've seen on a show. I can understand writers who do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think they would have had some social contact in their lives, enough to make communication seem natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> The voice that acted, although not horrendous, was hardly a shining example of human achievement. "Oh Shade, you are breaking the law!" Shade's mother sighed hesitantly. "You must come with me, young man." Cries Frieda, the withered old woman from the Silverwing Colony. The actors try, but it does not matter at this point, as the story becomes less and less attractive with every minute of the pass. <br /> <br /> While each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is typical of most television series, the arcs of the story that dominate the saga, for better and for worse. While the main point of the story is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes approach other arcs of history, involving cannibal bats from the jungles of the south and a budding war between birds and beasts. The writers try to do too much at the same time, struggling to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that it will attract the interest of the audience enough to keep the bloody spectacle. Unfortunately, these attempts are useless for all, except for the children of eight to ten years to whom this show is directed. <br /> <br /> While it is nice to see that the Canadian media are perpetuated, it would be much sweeter if the possibility of The series was not limited to the immediate family of animators or fans of Kenneth Oppel's books. There are worse things that your children might be seeing than Silverwing, but there are also much better programs. Pass mediocrity and read the books instead.
