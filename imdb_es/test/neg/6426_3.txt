The movie starts pretty well. It is a truly terrifying scene, as a pair of fugitives fleeing the law destroy an innocent family that lives in an isolated country house and kills the mother and father. The young daughter only manages to escape with the help of a mysterious specter, which kills the two assailants while she covers in a closet below. Then, we catch up with her 15 years later, as a student addicted to drugs who investigates the supernatural, lives with her promiscuous aunt and is cared for by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and still has strange visions that no one else can see. So yes, life is great. Things get much nicer when she quarrels with her mother's sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched on her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who will be the main suspect in the police. This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relationship with our heroine who has been wrong with them before her death. Could she be the culprit, or maybe the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? Hint: if you think first, you have chosen the wrong Blockbuster movie. Go back and get the correct, myopic gimp. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move quickly towards the good parts, with the certainty that I was not losing anything but a mediocre suspense meter. But the first ten minutes got me, and I decided to give it a try. I was quite surprised: it was not a masterpiece, but the performance was good enough and the script continued to show intriguing situations from which I hoped to find the solution. Unfortunately, 45 minutes later, I realized that my attention was beginning to wander during a long sequence in which the main character walked around a library doing nothing. Then we got a cheap scare, followed by a quarter of an hour from Goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new piece of boyfriend. Things only got worse from there, since the promising start is thrown out the window when we have an unconvincing twist of the plot after another, followed by an anti-climatic ending that is like promising the moon and ending with a tiny meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it were bad at all, it would have been much easier to swallow. The fact that it starts at a gallop and that it barely ends with a moan is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that started so promisingly end up being so formulated? I do not know, and I do not particularly care. I will only give the writer and the director advice for the next time: do not spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your script, then 5 minutes finishing the rest. He tends to notice these things in the final product when he treats his project as carelessly as he has done here ... 3/10
