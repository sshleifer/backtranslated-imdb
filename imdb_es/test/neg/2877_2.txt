The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy in which the film industry remains a backdrop. An American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, is stuck in India. Worse yet, she has run out of money. Then he decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical, so that he can earn enough money to return to his country. Here you can meet the Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails at the script level. Just calling a movie a Hollywood adventure does not guarantee a quality cinema. Calendula stands out as the best example. The art direction is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold turns out to be a fake. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's is far from being recognized as a decent audience. Consequently, Salman offers his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge screen presence. In terms of performance, she is also good. <br /> <br /> You can also find good reviews about this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
