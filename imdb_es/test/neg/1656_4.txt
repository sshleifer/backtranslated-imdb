I was so eager to see this movie that I really can not understand how I had the impression that I would enjoy it. I'm afraid it's really a yawning festival: all the bosses in the cinema I attended yawned and moved frequently throughout the film. This is a shame because it is a fantastic story, I tend to think it would be a better read. It does not help the main character who only shows his teeth once, and that was as a result of the angle of the camera. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the dilemmas of the main character. However, the suspense and drama that could have made this film one of the best rated have been spoiled by the boring treatment. Bored as a documentary half!
