I can only assume that the previous publications came from executives of the production company ... <br /> <br /> I attended the premiere in the UK last night. Zane and Brook attended (they probably knew he was going to be there) and they are, without doubt, stars, but what a movie turkey. Sometimes I felt sorry for them, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious scenes of "suspense". <br /> <br /> But maybe I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of irony was intended. If so, pure genius. Otherwise, career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Zane always shines, and Brook can act a little. As the other half said (when we left the movies, with broken ribs), you can forgive them for this movie, since they both look like nice people! The screenwriter, however, must be abandoned.
