Well, I am Singapore and I would like to say that it is time to stop stereotyping Singaporeans and make those films. Some of the actors / actresses actually have talent, but unfortunately it did not show much in this movie. I was restless in my seat when I saw this, being quite young at that moment, my parents dragged me to see it. I could honestly say that I was going to fall asleep. And there was this arrogant westernized child who got nervous. In general, a boring movie and a general waste of the talent of the actors. I have seen better films from Singapore than this one. The Rice War with Chicken was good. However, I can not believe that this is considered a better movie of Singapore. I'm sorry, I would not recommend it.
