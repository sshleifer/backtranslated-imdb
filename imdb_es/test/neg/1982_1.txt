When The Spirits Within was published, all they heard from fans of Final Fantasy was how horrible the movie was because it did not look like Final Fantasy. This is a different story, for better or for worse. Family settings, characters, music, history and superior action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. The problem is that it's just not a good movie. <br /> <br /> The direction during the fight scenes is often neglected, changing the camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action look more frantic, but it only serves to make the scenes They look confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is exceptional, but I can not say it's the best I've seen since Spirits Within had many more details about the characters, although I must admit that the Advent Children's characters moved a lot more naturally <br /> <br /> The plot is practically a black hole. It is a giant deus ex machina designed exclusively to return Sephiroth for a final fight. The old characters reappear, but they have no real purpose other than to please the fans. The development of the character is non-existent and the film does nothing to solve any of the threads of the plot that remain hanging after the end of the game. But it's full of impeccable wrestling scenes with magic, invocations and limits, which is probably what the fans wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, Advent Children is a very eye-catching action movie, but totally intelligent. That serves more as a complementary story for Final Fantasy VII than as a real continuation. <br /> <br /> By the way, do not think you're hurting my feelings by voting. It's not useful. It just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys / fangirls resent my objectivity so much.
