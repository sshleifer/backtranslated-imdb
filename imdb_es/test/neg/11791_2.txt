I suppose that for 1961 this movie was supposed to be "great", but looking back (45 years), its charm was as foolish as its entertainment value! Of course, special effects work well on TV with the series that began in 1964, but for the BIG screen? I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I must agree with the Octopus scene near the end where it adhered to the ocean view. Obviously it is not well organized ... or trained! In general, it is bad enough to act with special effects of poor quality and I still recommend it, for fun, laughs. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's biggest movies and I think he thought a lot about that. Barabara Eden went on to play "Genie" on TV, Micheal Ansara was her husband. Now that's a good part of this movie! I always liked seeing the real teams of husband and wife protagonists of the same movie. Organized !
