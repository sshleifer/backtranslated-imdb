My mom did not let me see this movie when I was in second grade, because she said it was too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mother, I was awake and I saw it on PBS. Well, maybe the accumulation after all this year led to the great disappointment of this movie, but I found it lame. It did not age well, and this made the performance go choppy, huge holes in the script incredible, but there are some great scenes like car chases and a big gun fight. I will not stay for this movie again.
