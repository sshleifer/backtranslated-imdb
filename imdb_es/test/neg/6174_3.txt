Ugh Even the ever popular Diane Lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting part of the movie was to see if Rourke's face would move. One has heard many "gossip" about his failing facelift, etc., so as an accident on the side of the road, we had to slow down and see the accident. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional mafia killer who somehow gets hooked on a wild and uncontrollable punk / thief, and throughout this movie we wonder why this guy stays with this idiot, let alone meets the guy first. Then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to persecute the witnesses. He would have burst them at that very moment. But then, we would not have had a movie, right? And why did the real estate agent accept the extortion? There were more holes in this movie than in my colander. The acting was horrible, the whole movie was predictable so far, and even the ending. And a lot could have been done to make this a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and you do not have to use any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
