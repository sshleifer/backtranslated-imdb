Having spent the previous six years of writing and production, Luc Besson returns to the director's chair with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Léon, and I quite liked the possibility of a French black and white film from the same group. <br /> <br /> André is addicted to lies and gambling, he owes money to almost all lenders in this country. Paris. Unable to pay his debts, and tired of being stopped at the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to commit suicide. It happens that he does it at the same time as a mysterious woman, whom he decides to save. Determined to thank her, she begins to help him fix his own life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with some laughs, which work well at all times. The images are quite nice and work well with the views of Paris. But that's it. That's all the movie has in its favor. And these two simple facets can do nothing to contain the torrent of the terrible film that the film unleashes. Although I can not blame the main character (although their inconsistencies are close), the eponymous is frightening. A terrible presence on screen and bitterly annoying. The plot is ridiculously inconsistent in itself, and sometimes it is ridiculously silly, particularly the ending; an ending that completely bloodied the incipient redemption engendered by the scenes immediately preceding. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene I have had the ignominy to observe, is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic and too horrible to be "so bad that is funny." The general premise of the film could possibly have had potential potential, but it is brutally massacred by the infinitely terrible implementation of its ideas. The movie was really a task to watch, and one that made me scream on the screen during the whole process. <br /> <br /> With an immense and immense failure, Angel-A is simply bad. Although their occasionally funny dialogue manages to giggle at odd intervals, in the end it is clear that this movie is just disgusting.
