Synopsis Correction: The ending does not show Ben cruising online for men. He is looking for Arabic language courses at the Military Academy of Presido in San Francisco. Maybe to join the war in Iraq as a translator, (for your information, many of the disgraceful downloads of "D'ont ask D'ont tell have been translators (now they are the biggest shortage of supply) Ben also spoke in Russian. This movie is a good time of life in Manhatten, but it's quite a reality here, mainly a good laugh from Lame's social skills and the sad portrait of "Adults" in their twenties that do not develop beyond the party mode Also a brief study of the Change of scene in Manhatten. (Somehow, it always stays close to the edge of the same BS) <br /> <br /> Watch the films "Englishman in New York" and "The New Twenty "Both are good for nostalgia, I think the" twenty "movie shows how much the blurring between homosexuals and heterosexuals has evolved. <br /> <br /> These two movies are GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!!
