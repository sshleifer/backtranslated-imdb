This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it was not even funny at all, I'm not sure why people say that this movie is funny because it sucked so much !! Felix Bean the main character sucked. Susanna Reeked This movie was made in 1996 and was really set in the 80s. What else, I will never let my friend choose movies anymore. Hmm, the cover of the movie said it was from the super soldiers' producers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only time that was fun was Freaky Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily ended up together. That was fun. Everything and everything, reeked, loss of time and sleep. Wow, I never thought that a movie like this could be made, so foolish to see it to see it until the end.
