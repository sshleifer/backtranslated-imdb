Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a series of gruesome murders that sent a wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950s. It is suspected that his wicked mind and twisted world are caused by his Lutheran mother, jealous and dominant. Ed received the nickname "The Butcher of Plainfield". He would steal corpses from new tombs of women who looked like his mother and would have sex with them before "dressing them up like a deer" in his garage. Heads cut with bodies hanging upside down being his personal mark. After his arrest there would be many articles made of human skin found in his house. In this film, a young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes the search for Gein (Kane Hodder) personal, when his stockist mother (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. The acting is much better than the ridiculously liberal account of the documented events related to Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
