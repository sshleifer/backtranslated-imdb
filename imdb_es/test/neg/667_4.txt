Eight teenage convicts are taken to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it as a community service. They soon discover that it is the residence of a great psychopath (Kane) who likes to retire and collect eyeballs. It does not help that the guard that takes care of them (Steven Vidler) has had a previous confrontation with the beast four years before. <br /> <br /> A guilty pleasure of mine are the slasher movies. Most of them are misdirected and act, but still retain some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It presents an atrocious writing and acting, but the scenes of the death are quite good and the film turns out to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it did not work very well. Actually it was just a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan focused on the scenes of death and nothing more apparently. The scenes of death itself are quite good and frightening. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and achieved some creative murders. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite insipid and without complications. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional and we do not know much about them. It was difficult to feel for these people because they were quite unpleasant. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I expected his presence on the screen to be more terrifying, but he did not do a good job. A second type of Jason Voorhees, so to speak. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this movie probably will not help or hurt their careers. <br /> <br /> While the death scenes are bloody, they are not necessary to scare. There really is no suspense, just some bloody scenes of death. Because of this, the movie does not have much repetition value. Also, if you do not like Slasher movies, do not waste time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent movie, but it's generic and forgettable, so it's not worth seeing. Rating 6/10
