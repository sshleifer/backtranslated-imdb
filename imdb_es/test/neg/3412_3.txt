After watching the first film in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited she was about the set and how upset she was when the release date was delayed. I've seen a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Some great ?? The curse of the woman who cries. Some entertaining despite obvious flaws? Night of the bloody apes. And a little cheese? Choose any Saint movie. One thing all these films have in common is that none can be called "boring". Well, that's not the case with the Aztec mummy. It's been a while since I last saw something that induced sleep. I did not expect or expect a great movie, but at least it entertains me! The Aztec mummy takes all the situations that could be interesting and takes away her life through repeated scenes of people who do nothing and then extend those scenes for what seems like an eternity. I guess that's what happens when you make an 80-minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. Extraordinary stuffing! For example, for anyone who has seen the film, what other purpose does The Bat have to take a masked fighter to the screen and extend the execution time in 15 or more useless minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two films in The Collection are more entertaining than this one.
