If I could give this movie less than a 1, I certainly would. I had read a review of this movie in the LA Times and I found myself walking through the theater and remembered the criticism. My wife and I agreed and we think it can not be as bad as the critic said, you know, critics. Indeed ... Give me a break with the horrible performance, the horrible camera work, the misuse of the budget (which has been mentioned again and again as an excuse). I have worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It is the Director and the Producer who make the movies work, they choose the teams. That's. If they do not put it together and they make it work ... it just will not do it. Therefore, they did not - and it does not. I do not think they can ... I just had to take the time to write this review ... although I'm sure the film crew does not appreciate this review. I hope you are doing everyone a favor. My wish for you to do well, but - in another race. Good luck.
