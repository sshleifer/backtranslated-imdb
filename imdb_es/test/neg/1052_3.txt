Physical Evidence is one of those movies that you like, but in reality they should be much better than they really are. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that everyone involved only succeeded while waiting for something better to happen. The premise is perfectly useful, it's mostly technically efficient if it's horribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly nice, but you can not help but feel that things would have been better if one of the potential customers had turned out to be the killer (As it was rumored that it was originally the case). As demonstrated by the initial scene of his small and disastrous Heat (1986), Reynolds has all the characteristics of a great villain of the screen. As they are, there are few surprises and a sensation of filming half by number as a head of intertia accumulates, as it wanders selflessly towards a will less than that of great will. final. <br /> <br /> Reynolds is fine, navigating through charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately, the same can not be said for Theresa Russell. An impressive and audacious actress in the films of her husband Nic Roeg, which allows her to enter the darker side of human nature, is trapped in a part that requires star quality instead of depth, and does not have it lightly . He does not erase his lines or run into other actors, but that is all that can be said in favor of his surprisingly forced and often amateur acting that leaves the film wrong. Apart from Ned Beatty's prosecutor, the supporting cast adds only a slightly surreal presence in Boston, where everyone seems to have a poorly disguised Canadian accent and the streets bear a striking resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. <br /> <br /> Similarly, director Michael Crichton, who at Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed he knew how to tilt an audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action in a way purely superficial, in fact, in a brief pursuit the Don shots do not even match and seem thrown almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no talent and is completely devoid of threats or dangers, and many scenes are reproduced for much less than they are worth. It is not surprising that, apart from the unapproved referrals in The 13th Warrior, Crichton has not run since. <br /> <br /> It can be seen in a television movie of the 80s, although it is never up to the Promise of its opening. Whether it is a sufficient reason to see it, it is due to an individual taste.
