Would a different translation have made it colder or more frightening? Are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? Does it even matter? You may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. Well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. <br /> <br /> If it's not about homosexuality, murder, dismemberment, psychopaths, madness, deviant psychology, then it's about acting: act with a lot of dialogue, so enjoy the performance or think how. Titling the dialogue is actually. <br /> <br /> For English speakers, "Twelve Angry Men" could be a better option. There is a little more interaction, and you can judge whether the performance is consistent with the dialogue. You do not have to ask yourself if you're missing something. <br /> <br /> I would recommend the "Empire" of Andy Warhol to those who like this movie.
