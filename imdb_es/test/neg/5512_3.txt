This movie is a desperate attempt to take advantage of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled images from "Battle Beyond the Sars", which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this one is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars"; There is not a real performance in this movie (but it's a Roger Corman movie: What did you expect? Again, the whole soundtrack was performed on a keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects are recycled from "Battlestar Galactica". special effects because the spatial scenes of another film were recycled / reorganized, as something that came out of the salvation of the Salvation Army of 1981. As expected, the little boy in this film offers a great performance, and would reappear to star in the film. "Over the Top" by Sylvester Stallone, I give this movie 3 stars out of 10
