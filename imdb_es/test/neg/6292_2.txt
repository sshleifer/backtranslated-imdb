Distestive British film of a Japanese novel about a very worried young man who is under the influence of a classmate similar to Hitler and plans to harm the lover of his widowed mother. A couple of good scenes (Sarah Miles discovered that her son had been looking at her furtively and was confronting him with anger, the pale-faced boy who was trying to catch Kris Kristofferson for his death for being very friendly), but what is the point? beyond causing a shock? Ugly and uncomfortable, it does not show anyone involved in any advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose blank looks and usual serious talk are out of place in a psychological mix like this). Coldly, without any sense of his own absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to believe that a circumstance like this could happen. If he's right, that's much more shocking than anything in "Sailor." * since ****
