This is a pale imitation of "Officer and a gentleman". There is no chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who interprets his love interest. The dialogue is made of wood, the situations trite. It is too long and the climax is anti-climatic (!). I love the USCG, its men and women are bold and tough. The action scenes are awesome, but this movie does not do much to recruit, I'm afraid. The script is formulaic, but confusing. Is the character of Kutcher trying to redeem himself by an accident that was not his fault? Costner's is infuriating against the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is as deep as a puddle of mud. I saw this advance for free and I certainly felt that I got the value of my money.
