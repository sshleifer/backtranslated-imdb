The fifth "Emanuelle Negro" I've seen has, potentially, the most intriguing plot that deals with the intrepid reporter investigating the white prostitution / slavery scandal that takes her from San Francisco to Rome, to Macao and back to her own home . Hometown, New York! The film is full of veterans of the series who, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (who appears here as head of a United Nations committee for the Third World countries), Karin Shubert (as a feminist reporter rival) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual in this type of film (although it is shown in the dark of the night), it is very edited and it is an especially graphic scene (described in "Stracultr) in the that an Asian slave trader gets his ransom for being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen, however, it is a harrowing sequence at the end of the film when a shoddy politician cheats on a couple of girls (including, naturally, Gemser and Shubert) on a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of vagabonds (this is the way you get your votes, get it!) - with your high society friends watching intently - it seems pretty intact. <br /> <The most ridiculous element of this entry, apart from the gems.The inclination of er to undress completely every time he enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers), is his trip to India to interview a charlatan n / Guru (George Eastman has managed to look considerably like a Christ!) who has found a way to prolong intercourse indefinitely; Of course, when Emanuelle calls him, he ends up having premature ejaculation ... !!
