One of the fun things about being young is that one can easily be fooled by advertising. I've spoken before in another movie, in which the commercial of the movie (comedy) makes it look more fun than it is. Seeing the announcement of this in 1981 made me think that it was going to be a tremendously funny movie. What I and my brother who went to see with me did not know is that the scene used in the television ad was the last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that came before in the movie, I can only assume that there was nothing more fun to use! The last scene is, thanks to a youthful potion, Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long, bearded old man into a bright young Asian / Elvis like a rock star! (With backup singers, no less!) <br /> <br /> With a scenario with no real reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does everything he can with the material at hand, but he does not have any really good reason for your "comedian". moments The rest of the actors were simply bored and my brother and I sat down along all this without hardly laughing at anything. It was natural for us to expect a "Pink Panther" comedy, and Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> It's a sad shame that this was his last movie before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this ill-conceived failure. Still, I do not blame him. I blame everyone involved for not trying to make a better movie of this. 2 stars is to be generous !!
