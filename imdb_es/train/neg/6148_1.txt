First of all, the movie was not true to the facts at all. I just watched the documentary a few days before and the movie did not look like anything. First of all, Nash was a genius of mathematics and this is what the film should have been about, not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end, and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong: the scene in which he traveled with a bicycle on campus happened in his early college years, not after that. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit into this part since he does not seem to be the intelligent / individualistic type, so he really could not interpret one. It would have been great if he had focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on love life too dramatized. At this level, ABM was too Hollywood and too superficial to be big. Personally, I think he was not crazy or paranoid and had something to do with people of that caliber who tend to know more than we, the "lower mortals". 5/10
