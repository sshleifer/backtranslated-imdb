Take pretty young people, put them in an exotic place, put some bad guys in, make the two main characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the weakest plots and then make a happy ending for everyone (apart of the three or four who are murdered, of course) That's the classic (and successful) format of the Harlequin Romance. It is not very good, but it is not very bad either, like most of the small yellow pocket books. And things about the location in Budapest are especially interesting, even if you did not use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the famous thermal baths of the city.
