This movie really had a great start. It had the potential to become a truly heartbreaking romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be anything more than that, and for a moment I was thrilled that someone was finally making a beautiful movie for itself, another timeless classic, maybe a modern myth. Why, oh why, then ruin it halfway by making the main character (Norton) another psychopath? Maybe I'm missing the point, but do we really need another movie about psychopaths? Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature as indicative of a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment there, I was going to make a mental note of the director's name; Now I am feeling indifferent. At least it should be added to the defense of the film that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. In addition, Evan Rachel Wood is really charming and a good actress with a lot of potential.
