First of all, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is nothing wrong with making a movie like this one to try to present the gospel message. So my objections to this movie are not in their sincerity or their aspirations. As a Christian, although a millennialist, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return when he has said it. So, although I do not agree with this movie about ecstasy, that's not why I rate this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me qualify this film so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, horrible script, mediocre performance and lamentable effects. This movie is located down there with some of the science fiction foods of the 1950s. No, this movie is ranked down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not age well and was probably dated at the time they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The producers of films of the genre Apocalypse could have learned how not to make a film of the last times, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega Code series could not learn from this because they dealt with FX problems and the problem of outdated appearance, but their scripts are still deficient and their performance is made of wood. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian movies, with extremely low budgets, but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised that the MST3K team has never made fun of this one.
