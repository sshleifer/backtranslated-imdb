I am studying Catalan and I loved finding El Mar, a film with mostly Catalan dialogues, in my video store in the art house. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I'm not so happy I saw it. <br /> <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well done and very well photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is surprisingly violent, it is well acted and convincing. (For the most part, that's ... would the Majorcans throw a corpse in preparation for the burial right in the center of the town square, in full view of the 10-year-old dead man's boy?) Oh, well ... Detail minor. Up to this point, I had the feeling of a non-magical Pan labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have arrived. old. Francisca is a nun who works in a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two children, Manuel and Ramallo, are patients. I know, but well, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (apologies to the Almod√≥var fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are so dangerous * rare *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogues are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> What's more, it descends to a horrible and miserable excess. Be prepared for a LOT of pain and LOTS of blood. The critic who called him "potboiler" is on the right track. If it had been done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE THE PROHIBITED LOVE! VIOLATION!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! TREASON!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters credible. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to shape the characters. As it is, it seems a strange and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If that sounds like something you have to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I'm going with something that does not make me feel like I need to take a shower to wash my blood and sadness. <br /> <br /> As for Catalan, it is the Mallorcan dialect, quite different from Barcelona. Dialect, although I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonians apparently needed subtitles in Catalan to understand it.
