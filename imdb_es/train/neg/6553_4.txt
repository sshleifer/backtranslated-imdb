Years after the fall of the last of the big corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark era where cyborgs are collected by their parts. Cash, a cyborg woman, travels to a doctor in a desert to receive news that she is pregnant. In the escape of Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find his way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (and finally now) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival that became a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that really improved on its predecessor, but was not widely seen (and was rejected by those who saw it as cheap fodder). <br /> <br /> This movie, on the one hand, tries to be a combination of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action movie, while the second was an intelligent Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately it stays It cuts in both aspects. The budget was obviously lower than that of CYBORG 2, with the film taking place in the arid desert lands (like many other post-apocalyptic action films of the 90s), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs . <br /> <br /> The story of the film focuses on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, which is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the OVA anime series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget science fiction action films are victims of, in the fact that the inconveniences (synthetic organisms) presented are nothing but droids. The visual effects are nothing more than prosthetic arms and make-up effects. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite standard for this type of film, with the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the only one with worse performance on display. Instead of being content with the news that she is pregnant, she acts as a complainer and moody. His castmates are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual type of gangster who animates the scenes in which he appears and Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the main villain. Of particular interest is Andrew Byniarski, who plays the right hand of Lynch, who would later appear in the remake of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and its prequel.
