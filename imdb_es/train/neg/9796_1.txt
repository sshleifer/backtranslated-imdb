Okay, seriously, I can not think of anything worse than the public relations series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, the Power Rangers have to be at the end of this list. Can you think of something more stupid than five and six teenagers (who do not even act like a normal teenager) dancing in identical costumes WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THEM BACK? Fans, have you ever met a real person who is thrown against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? The Power Rangers are for boys of five years, and believe me, I never liked this program, even when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers actually act like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or not, as a teacher. He has adolescent humor, although the fight is scarce, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that the Power Rangers are crap, but I would not. It would be an insult to shit. So accept it, boys of five years, Power Rangers are garbage.
