I went into this with the hope that it was the little "provocative" gem that people have reviewed as. I love indy movies and I hope this is good too. Knowing how important this topic is, I hope that I have a lot of fun, maybe I will even see a perspective from outsiders. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow ... if you get into a torture, or a mutilation, maybe you'll like this Personally I do not like the idea of ​​urinating or cutting myself, so I thought it was trash. bad script, bad performance, bad history, bad direction, bad editing ... could continue. I have no idea why a critic stated that he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10. That is misleading and ignorant. Voting for a movie on IMDb is not setting a precedent! just let other people think that a garbage bomb like this one is fine to see it whenever it is controversial (this movie is not, try to be VERY DIFFICULT but fail). <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is bad when in 15 minutes you pray for all the main characters to die horribly. unfortunately, they do die, but not in the painful ways that the viewer would have given some justice or vindication for having seen the 2 hours of shit they just endured. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor, just do not bother. I got this movie in a cheap trash can in my local video store for 0.50 and I feel cheated!
