I love the "Masters of Horror" series, often wrong. Fans of horror live in a constant lack of food. Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" with "Feast" we liked or piled it up) are breeding ground for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror inclination to develop and bring to maturation food for whom I love to eat about horror. <br /> <br /> This began with a core of kolas of really kool-idea and ran ... right on the verge of "what the hell am I going to go with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to spoil the damaged material, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, there was that light floating in the night sky before ... long ago luminescent aliens of hair (huh? ? ... HUH?) Perforating the brain of men and ... yes, I understand ... but ... the worst curse of storytelling: a moving and promising organization without a rewarding outcome. <br /> <br /> Reference to the storytellers ... your accumulation must have a reward that exceeds the accumulation. Not the other way. Storytelling math 101. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers - Wow!
