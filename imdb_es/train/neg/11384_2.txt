From the time that Europe began to fight World War II, until the end of the war, Hollywood (with great support from the government) made tons of films that were designed to try to get young people to join the Army, making The life of a military man seems "great". This is, by far, the most neglected, which implies that the life of a soldier lacks work, you get the best food and you can be all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in World War II, but I think there was more than that. There is a trick of the most simple cat plot, and a lot of musical numbers with some of the main acts of the day. <br /> <br /> I believe that in 1943, even the most naive of civilizations knew that there were more things to do. abroad that crazy crazy people portrayed in this movie. While I'm sure it was meant to be seen as an escapist entertainment, I can not help wondering if the family and loved ones of the men who fight in the war were amused or rejected by this trivialization of the sacrifice of their loved ones.
