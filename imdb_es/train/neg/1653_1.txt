It seems strange that someone read this script and thought: "This is funny, I mean, it's so funny that it should only be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in most possible ways. There is not a bit of good dialogue, not a single nice character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst movie in history, "No Hold's Barred" by Hulk Hogan, by quite considerable. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> <br /> The ending is completed with several minutes of shots, and it is still less than 80 minutes. The shots include cast members who laugh at the "hilarious" mistakes they've made, and the things that went wrong on the set of this "comedy." I'm glad to see someone laughs somehow, with some connection to this "movie". <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing. Go and go. It's really lame. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. This is so bad that it is ... something, but I do not know what, and I hope I never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet does not stink, and in fact it's the only good thing that I like. about this movie of aspirants. But, that really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
