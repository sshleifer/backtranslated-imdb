Released in 1965, but clearly filmed years before, this is a melodrama of small and inept crimes with an inept seizure on the front. As is usual in the grindhouse films of the time, there is a good amount of undressing and dressing for no reason, complemented by terrible music, an annoying narrative and an uncomfortable edition. The scene of the cafeteria feels the unbearable bases, since we cut from one side to the other between the characters to avoid that they really see their sentences. All we get are reaction shots to the off-screen character voice! Misty Ayers, of the 50s, takes off her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action begins. She is continually accompanied by what is apparently archival music, from romantic to western to the mother of the dishes, mixed at random to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever captured in the film. Look how it hits you! Watch how he hits the game! Will it inhale or be captured by the Apaches? Only time will tell !! The film tells the sordid story of how Sally is tricked into working in a whorehouse, falls in love and can not escape. For some reason, they invite us to some of the most boring and boring prostitutes who have ever committed themselves to filming, literally doing their nails or knitting instead of entertaining the clientele. Some stupid boring comedy (a drunk lady accidentally drinks milk! Har Dee har!) And the performance of a silent movie does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've seen, even in the marquee of Something Weird Video. It is really a cinematic curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema: very bad cinema.
