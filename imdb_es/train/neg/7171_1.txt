This movie seems to be completely useless. There is no reason why something should happen, as if it had been written by a young child who got bored halfway and thought "how can I summarize this?". And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not completely sure that there is one that is very frank, but if there is, it did not register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while attacking, like you. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl in it, they meet Christopher Walken, who has unearthed an old woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for the only reason that the story continues and she shows her gratitude by freezing it immediately. From then on everything becomes a bit silly. A couple of hours of my life that I would like to return!
