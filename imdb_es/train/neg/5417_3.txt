Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they have been reduced to their last franc. To support their luxurious lifestyle, the three use the services of a forger and use the notes in the casinos, hoping to exchange the fake coin for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an envoy from the United States, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make friends with the visitors, hoping to get financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with a steady advance towards Helen, while disappointing the count's maid, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the folly of American women and the inappropriate behaviors of aristocrats), instead of telling a story, and the film can really bore modern audiences, like me, easily doing that. Even the performance, which is great in later EvS like Greed and Wedding March, was just executed here. The film could have used improvements at various levels. Score, 3.
