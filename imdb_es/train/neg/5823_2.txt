"Drawing Restraint 9" is a type of film that one loves or hates; Fortunately or not, I left him with a strong sense of wasted time and being completely full of propaganda of "killing whales is bad". Aesthetically, the film could have been nice, especially its first half, until it is not clear that each action represented serves as an allegory of several aspects of whaling. Until then, it might be a little fun to look at the daily tasks of the workers in Japan, but later it becomes obvious that everything on the screen is propaganda, and no painting itself is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses the old game device of morality, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of the action, but are engraved in stone. Probably it's just me, but it seems to me that this kind of art is superficial and preconceived, even when it comes to the noble quest (without sarcasm to protect the environment). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a cardinal sin. when the material of a film is stretched without any justification, just by stretching. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could have been easily adjusted in 75 minutes, but has a tortuous duration of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough to leave gaps of anything of 15 minutes without previous notice. The film does not have a standard scenario, and there is no evolution of the characters, but neither is it a documentary, it is rather a kind of conceptual installation. It's an unusual way for a movie, but it can still be seen as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also think that the director should have had a bit of honesty and did not pretend that it could only be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the music is more like the sounds of whales. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
