God, I'm so sick of the shit that comes out of the United States called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Ever since the anime became popular, the animators of the USA. UU They produce a cartoon with a lazy 5 year old boy. drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese animation scam. (Usually, it ruins the classic characters) It's no wonder that the anime is beating American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They are not even trying! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard this last night; I live in the UK and when I found out that this program first appeared in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so up to date with the current programs.
