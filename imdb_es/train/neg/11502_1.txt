This movie is very slow and has no argument. It transmits the lives of a group of boat workers fired. One of the oldest is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social comment here, but it is confusing since no one is painted with a very sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why I had a 7.8 when I decided to see it. I saw everything tedious and built expectations for a great redemptive reward. Unlucky. The IMDb rating has always been a good match for my tastes. Anything above 6.5 was worth seeing. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie. He's not my type, so my agreement does not mean much. <br /> <br /> I sigh. I give him a 1.
