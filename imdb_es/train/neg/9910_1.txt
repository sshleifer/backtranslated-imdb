One of the worst movies in history. It's not funny, bad television-style cinematography, bad acting. It's sad to see so many famous old actors who can barely walk, let alone act. The protagonist Nancy Young can not act. Terrible address Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the film does not make sense. Somehow, they are supposed to prevent a wedding from happening, but there is no logic behind their actions. The slow pace made my wife stop looking, but I suffered. The old ones are supposed to be acting as if they were young and horny, but it is pathetic rather than fun. How did they get the money to do this?
