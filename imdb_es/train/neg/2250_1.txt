Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a star overnight. Esther's star rises while John's declines, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-cracking on a desert highway. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take her seriously as a promising star, when she is already a star. The first time she appears, singing in a dead end, she resembles an established singer star who lives in a poor neighborhood to spend the night, not as a stranger in distress who tries to start her career as a singer. She is too trusting, too professional. His apartment looks like a "Apartment Living" page, not an apartment with a hole in the wall where a real singer with problems would live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson takes care of the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role as ... well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but who does not have much talent for acting . The direction is lukewarm, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, the boring direction or the slow story. Is the hair! After staring at the horrible hairstyles of the 70s of Kristofferson and Streisand, your eyes hurt.
