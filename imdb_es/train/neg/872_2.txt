First, I expected "Caged Heat" to be on the same line as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In no way is this film the exploitation of the 70, "chix in chains" or "women in prison." Of course, the plot consists of a group of women in prison, who wear street clothes by the way (quite funny), but NOTHING happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the director or doctor to try to escape, and there are no prisoners. There are 2 scenes of the shower, which I suspect are only recycled images, but no fights are unleashed / no one is seduced here, or anywhere! Apart from the lack of plot, unconvincing characters, unpleasant and flat, a pair of inmates who manage to escape actually return to prison to "release" their fellow inmates ?? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should have ended with the fugitives riding towards sunset ... instead of letting this disaster continue! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
