How can you reunite this respectable cast of young British actors and reach a lot of film dung? Horrible script, annoying and agitated camera, badly edited, horribly badly acted. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill its role of life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes amounts to "dreck". Why can not money people read scripts in advance? Do yourself a favor: save yourself and do something else, like hitting a mallet on the knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
