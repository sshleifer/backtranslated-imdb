Spoilers? Maybe some details, but nothing too much related to the plot. Not as if this mattered with this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage brazenly starts the premise of Executive Decision air infiltration. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine to conceal an invisible armor while their idiotic tactics (similar to those used by 3rd graders when they play Star Wars in the backyard) they take them to absorb a rain of shots. <br /> <br /> What most entertained me about this movie was the use of actors of similar appearance. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, although it was so long ago that you probably will not be able to locate it (it was Porky's). Here Cyril plays a good version of a Bill Paxton character. The most hilarious is porker Gil Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as the Buck Rogers of television. Instead of evoking his slightly heroic past, Gerard offers us an acceptable interpretation of the crunchy, fat and tough person, which was clearly imagined for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good hybrid appearance performance like that of Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In the 10 years since New Jack City, the performance of Ice-T has deteriorated noticeably. It is not acting as much as a regurgitation of lines that I could have memorized. <br /> <br /> One of the elements that is reproduced in this film is a classified information CD-ROM. It is loading in the hand and, apparently, is incredibly unencrypted, despite the security aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke I doubt very much that the information that is supposedly on the CD will ever be assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the shots are as strong as the canned air, and they do not cause a person to shudder, so there is apparently no budget for life. The chosen assortment of weapons is quite fun. The use of a coffee stewardess is about the most realistic representation of violence in the film. When she intuitively takes the Uzi mini-gun, which has to be one of the worst pistol designs, that's too stupid. A true elite team would take MP-5 for these kinds of things or maybe SOCOMM .45, or even custom Hi-Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if it's a new school ... The scarce standard problem 92Fs are totally incredible, having lost most of its coolness after the Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced as soldiers of fortune, have a varied mix of absurdities, such as the aforementioned mini-Uzi gun and a Tec -9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism in which I would like to correct the other reviewers: the stewardess and Ice-T lowered the boat to 10,000 feet for "breathable air" before opening the door. And I also had the impression that the stewardess could not close the door, that she simply gave up at that point. As for the landing, the fins were not mentioned until about 2 seconds before landing. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Peril who elude Roscoe P. Coltrane in the "pass" could embarrass this film by the use of archival material. Obviously, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not acquire an F-117. Apart from the fact that they were already blocked in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2, and that at a target range in white ... Well, I I am not an expert, but I have doubts about whether I would be invisible in Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the repeated references to "F-15s" when they showed F-16s were ridiculous. The details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put those few passengers in a 747 to begin with, without mentioning everything that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show Catch it in stars or something like that. Do not pay to rent it, but you do look for laughs. In the fight for the worst movie in history, up there with No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.
