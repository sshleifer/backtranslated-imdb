Whatever the qualification I give to BOOM is just for the excellent location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for the hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its descending phase), and RICHARD BURTON (its miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train does not stop here anymore" and he is supposed to like this adaptation of his work very much, but apparently he was the only one. Reportedly, Taylor hated it and Burton needed the money. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor perching and smoking his way, exploiting the servants and exchanging bad baby conversations with nothing less. NOEL COWARD, who seems to be a visitor to another movie when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It's so cheesy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a kind of "must see". But if you can sit through it without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is the film that meant the end of Taylor as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and critics called it BOMBA. Judge for yourself if you dare.
