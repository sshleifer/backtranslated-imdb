I would like it to be known, that I often do not rate movies below 5. Originally, I was very excited to see this movie. His numerous trailer hits on television for several months made me want to see this movie. Then, the other night, when I saw that it was available on FearNet upon request, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story seemed intriguing enough: a guy is killing unsuspecting people. the subway. There is a photographer obsessed with the disappeared. Where are you going? What is happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him, yada yada. The movie had a way of absorbing you, although the plot was highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look behind you" I say, rather bored with the cheap emotions. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, was intriguing ... that is, until the end. "This was fine until the end ... Then he became stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke in the forums. And I totally agree. And here come the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Look, I expected him to be a crazy killer, a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Court. How original. How unrealistic How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but this one has sunk.
