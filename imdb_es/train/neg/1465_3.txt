Well, first of all, I would like to add that I am a little historian myself, so what I look for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course, the film is entertaining and all, but the fact that it is not completely based on real events is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before the First World War. However, it was during the First World War and after that he formed his views on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed brat. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to the puzzle that is Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he really does not fit into the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as the portrait here is. In his youth, he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people through his charms. His unstable behavior and his outbursts of anger began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a movie about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not on accusations. I really hate when people point to Hitler, for example, with a guilty finger, and tell inaccurate stories just to paint an image of them as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story EXACTLY as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like! Those who are behind this movie should have researched a little before doing this. Because it seems that they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was ripped off. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see this.
