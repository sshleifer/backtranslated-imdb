I have read some of the comments on this film and I can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It is so poorly written, directed and acted that it hardly leaves an impression. The characters speak in a dialogue full of clich√©s and the situations are completely implausible. While this can make this fun and fun, it is not because everything is so inanimate that the movie becomes boring. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but the studio executives did not allow her to give the story any realism or they did not have the balls. This movie could appear in the encyclopedia as the standard-issue bad-life TV movie.
