In fact, I saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I handed the money to the cashier, she said two words she had never heard in a theater, before or after: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I should have fired my money and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and saw the movie. This movie did not make anyone laugh in the theater. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Above all, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "This movie sucks!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, and then sit there silently stunned and bored for another ten minutes.
