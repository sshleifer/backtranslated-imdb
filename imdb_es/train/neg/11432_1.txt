Yesterday I saw this movie and I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this incredibly amazing script for five hours (or the time it lasted). From the beginning, every element of this movie is amazing. This movie made me chuckle several times, but most were surprised because the director / writer really expected us to create the many scattered elements that were trying to unite this movie. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Gray (Graham) and his problems with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have, in an unexpected way, too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something credible and acceptable, the director continues to lead Gray to these ridiculous turns that never really make any sense. Being an LGBT person, this film seemed to echo what all heterosexuals believe we go through in the presentation process. (I will feel insulted if the writer's queer). If it had not been for the nice chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), I would give it a negative 3 stars.
