This romantic comedy is not so bad. There are some fun things that happen here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is amateur (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are very funny, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end felt pretty good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
