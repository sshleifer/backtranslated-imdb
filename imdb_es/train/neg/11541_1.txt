This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It's amazing how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie have agreed to act in such a useless rubbish peace. The movie is about rape / beating and gender revenge. The couple went to the party and on the way back they collided with a deer and he left to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys arrived. He did not go to his car, instead, he was beaten and beaten while she tried to run the engine of the car that betrayed her and she was raped by a gang. Somehow, she is in her father's house and one of the bad guys is her daughter. neighbor, so she took a shotgun and wanted to kill him ... such a stupid scenario! Braman hollywood! He was against that revenge, but "She is raped", "They laugh at her", so she must kill them all ... But once inside the house, she was satisfied to push the top of the rifle in the anus of the bad guys and he left while he went crazy. and execute bad boy. Personally I think the director ran out of money before finishing this because the movie ends before they execute someone else involved in this rape and beating, which is not a big surprise because the sponsor has obviously seen this and wanted to get his money back . LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they will not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It's to disgust that British cinematography has made this peace from the garbage. Personally I like it and that is the reason why I have seen this. Do not do it yourself, you have better things to do than see a stupid stage movie ...
