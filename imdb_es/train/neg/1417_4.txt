While on vacation at the beach, red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (like Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The boys baptize their creature "Sammy", and spend the summer having fun with the sand wolf. When it is time to go home, the children begin to suffer separation anxiety. Does the young Mr. McGreevey decide that they can not take "Sammy" to "Disneyland"? er, "Gatesville" - but, the young Mr. Mumy packs it anyway. At home, they try to hide "the exit stamp" to adults and, of course? Kidnappings occur! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Way-out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
