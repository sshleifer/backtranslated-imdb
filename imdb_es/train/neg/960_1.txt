Oh darling. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a scam of the Ringu of Japan. Well, I guess the US They also did their version, but at least it was a new version. Too sad. I enjoy watching Filipino films and I know that great things can come from such a small country, so I can not believe that this happened. Claudine and Kris are such big names there, surprised that they were affiliated with plagiarism. For any aspiring filmmaker in the Philippines, you do not have to bend over to make money. There are many movie fans who are watching movies that Filipinos publish and enjoy!
