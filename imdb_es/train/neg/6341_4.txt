East Palace, West Palace reminded me of something to The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the police role, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I suppose, but it also perpetuates the myths about the gay men's femininity: a lot is made up of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and hurt by a macho man. Walk the park without fear: wait for the officer to take you to the police station. And that actually happens. He then tells the officer the whole story of his life while undergoing a mild torture: crouching for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the policeman's self-image as a manly man. The story about gay man's life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for gays in China, who just want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. I'm sorry, I can not relate.
