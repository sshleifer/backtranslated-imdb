It really does not matter that Superman's comics are incredibly naive and that his goal is ten years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At first, a question for you Dear readers, how many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? No one? Just as I thought. There are no spoilers here. So let's try some important problems right now. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie seems commercial (scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just a scene that looks like it's supposed to). Imagine a Superman commercial, lasting two and a half hours. Let's be serious, this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed." You really feel that this movie is too long. And the special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is ridiculous. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in the comic, in the cinema it seems stupid. And that is the case in this case. Of course the dialogues are a disgrace. I can not believe that someone took money to write them. How many times will we be fed with villains making speeches? How many times will the laws of physics be violated? (Jesus, it's not just the question of Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials he deals with.) How many times will Lois Lane cheat you out of Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers look for a story in a poor quality comic book? Since it's hard to make a good story, why have a weak story for a headline? It just does not work Guys, hold on. Try harder, please. Or simply stay on this strike forever, who cares. I have the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike. No offense. I do not question the scarce money that is paid to these people, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this point, it may be asked: is it so bad? Yes, it is.) <br /> <br /> Third, acting is weak, which is a big surprise since Bryan Singer (habitual suspects) is directing Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he is the only one. The audience is not in the mood for jokes. What happens is that the hero of the comic can become a real personality, with clear motivations, but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, nobody did that work, and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, all the effort of the creators turns this movie into a parody. The second unit is so bad that it draws attention, since there is nothing interesting on the screen anyway. The more they try (if they try), the more fun it becomes (but it's not the laugh you can expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular movie, ladies and gentlemen, is the camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money too. Stay home, read a book.
