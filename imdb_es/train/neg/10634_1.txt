The writer / director Bart Sibrel based his work here on a can of film that, according to him, was sent by mistake by NASA. He says he shows astronauts faking television images of their trip to the moon using camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and the editors in the field composed this raw material in just a few seconds of finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so careless that he does not realize his "behind-the-scenes" images really take much of the 30-minute live broadcast (also on that roll ) that was seen by millions, not hidden in the vaults of NASA as he indicates. And we have to ask ourselves why Sibrel puts his own conspiracy narrative on the audio of the astronauts in the images, because by listening to the astronauts in their own words it is clearly explained that the astronauts were only testing the camera, not falsifying images. <br /> <br /> Finally, anyone can see the raw material by itself without having to buy the pirated version of Sibrel. (He shows you more of Zapruder's movie about the JFK murder than about his "smoking gun.") Sibrel believes he is the only one who has seen him. What is more revealing are the clips of that raw material that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those that clearly show the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames, etc., destroying his claim that they were matted and Transparencies in the windows of the spacecraft to create the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel is based on innuendo, inexperienced assumptions, deceptive comments and selective quotations to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which it exists. It is not a fragment of real evidence.
