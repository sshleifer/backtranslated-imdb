** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can understand the extremely unpleasant topic, this movie offers a huge help of outrageously campy melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and cheated several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand that ANY filmmaker is inspired by this poor quality drama. None of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel HAS improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is pathetic and not as fun as the grinning and moody man. The piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk bag with the writing of this sow, which is full of outbursts of howls of dialogues and extravagant situations. For example, the final sequence, where Margaux grabs her shotgun and pursues Sarandon after her last shocking act is meant to be exciting, but instead provokes hearty laughter. Add a notoriously sharp and spacious music by Michel Polnareff and you will have a real guilty pleasure, although you are likely to feel dirty and need a hot shower after watching it. Do not say they did not notice you.
