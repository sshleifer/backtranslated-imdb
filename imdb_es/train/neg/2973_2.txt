I have two very important complaints regarding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental store put aside what is clearly a soft-core pornography in the "suspense" category. (If he had known what it was, he would not have wasted the time of renting it in the first place, and yes, this movie is a soft-core pornography). <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. Nobody in this movie does anything that is deviant or obsessive, much less a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> Actually, make those three main complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I saw the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. Boy, I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie has no value at virtually all levels.
