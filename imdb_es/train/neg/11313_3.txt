and it does not help Rohmer's case that a few years later, Syberberg appeared and did an amazingly great job on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie did not do it. He seemed so miserly when he came out, without Syberberg's movie to compare it, that he probably filmed in an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. In fact, I can not remember at this time if there are horses in the Syberberg movie. all I know is that the German version is pure magic, whereas this looks like a university production documented in a film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> the music ... the music ... is not even credited here in IMDb ... but someone based on "airs of the 12th to 14th centuries" or something like that ... well, It's not a big help for the movie. It is presented as inauthentic and cheesy, like the mage mon cher! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of those French authors who like their main men, in general, quite unattractive, and that does not help. Syberberg's Parsifal was adorable, and can be seen on German television today. selling a special bicycle class that he invented ... <br /> <br /> I shudder to think about what the Syberberg video looks like. I remember that the last time I saw the movie in a theater, the imprint was so bad that the experience was an immense 5-hour farce. But even then I would have to overcome what this version has to offer, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Seriousness points, for chutzpah, but ... this movie just needed a coup plus dollars. It does not look like a medieval manuscript, it looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh and yes, it only ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this work of cheesy passion is being interposed ... blah!
