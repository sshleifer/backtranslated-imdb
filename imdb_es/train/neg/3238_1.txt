Devil experiment: 1/10: unconditional porn movies are divided into two categories: those that have a plot appearance (Gee, which is a lucky pizza guy) and those that do not have (Anal Amateurs 36). The Devil Experiment falls solidly in the last category. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, the horror version of hard porn. A plot almost completely minus 43 minutes waiting for the injection of money. Filmed on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively undescriptive Japanese children who torture a rather unattractive Japanese girl. Tortures range from the banal (slapping her 50 times, kicking her a hundred times), the silly one (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), the fear factor (a bath of worms and sheep's guts) and, finally, the money thrown away . (A well executed eye piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, there is no plot, there is no reason, only shots of Blair Witch trees and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of shouting, "nobody waits for the Spanish Inquisition" during the scene of the office chair, she was bored. Looking stunned at the screen, waiting for the injection of money. Like hardcore porn.
