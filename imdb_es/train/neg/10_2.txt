This film had many promises and the plot was relatively interesting, however, the actors, the director and the editors seriously disappointed this film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The performance is wooden, very few of the characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Whoever edited this clearly learned some new editing techniques and wanted to splash them throughout the film. There are many fast and "flashy" editions in almost all scenes, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but end up being annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and I hoped there would be a decent resolution to break the balance, but unfortunately, it did not make me feel like I had wasted my time and that the filmmakers had lost their money.
