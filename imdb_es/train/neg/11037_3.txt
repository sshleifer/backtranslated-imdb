I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. That's great! When Jim throws that little person through the window, the expression on his face is priceless. So, when does he start addressing the priest on behalf of his wife only to discover that she has become the Pee-Woman? The good writing and the great cast, together with the great performance, make this a must see. I'm trying to find a certain photo of that episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think Greenman is very funny. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as Greenman? Can someone tell me the correct address to find a picture like that?
