['America needs the best possible man to win &quot;The game&quot;. Who do they hire? A gymnast (Oh brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game involving ninjas, a village of madmen and Richard Norton, whom Kurt Thomas tells him to &quot;keep his accessories in his pants&quot; . (His exact words) I missed this in the theaters and it&#39;s a good reason because I probably would have been thrown out because of the laughter in which I exploded at regular intervals. The first thing that came to my mind was how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is about 5 feet 4 and he almost does not consider it &quot;The best man for the job&quot; As for the acting talent of Kurt Thomas, well, if you can not say something good ... in all seriousness, although one has to ask yourself How much cocaine was being used to provide such a stupid idea? Only the decision to choose Tara Reid as a scientist is better than stupidity here. For 18 years, this held the title of the dumbest movie I had ever seen. It does not mean that I did not find this unappealable, I was laughing so hard that I almost choked. Twice. Only in the 80s could a movie be made with such a bad idea. Although for the record is the only movie that has such a weak hero, who can not even get a sword embedded from the ground. This is the smartest action movie ever made, and one of the funniest too. <br /><br /> * of 4- (Bad)']
