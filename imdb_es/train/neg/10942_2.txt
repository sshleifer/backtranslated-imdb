Lorenzo Lamas plays Jack `Solider` Kelly, a former Vietnam veteran and a renegade policeman who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from the hustlers. The atrocious movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is the third billed and yet he has 3 minutes of screen time, and even those are not good. In general, it is a terrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a bagged and gagged tree are worth some (involuntary) laughter. Followed by an improved sequel.
