Whatever your name (the writer and the director) should be locked in the hope that the garbage will never be done again. This is in a battle with some of the most terrible movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they are actually pretty good. This not. This was so bad that I got angry. Seriously. A 10-year-old drunk could have devised a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors had no inspiration to work, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely delayed and damaged the little story that was there, it is as if I had simply decided: "I want this to happen and that this happens, but I do not care how we got there, just shoot and put it in. Whatever, I go back to my trailer to get my nose, if someone calls me, I'm not here. " What a shame, whatever your name is. What a shame.
