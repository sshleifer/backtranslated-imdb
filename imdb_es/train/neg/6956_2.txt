I'm sorry, but every time I see a movie in which a woman sucks a man and the man does nothing but shrink, the film loses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately messed up the plot before it even took off (no pun). Dirk Benedict was much more plausible as the kind of sensitive hero than the new age Kattee Sackhoff, whose overacting will probably be praised in the future as "a compelling, exciting, unmissable and innovative performance" by the politically correct new-talk of the Today's review copy editors; but in essence, it's just an old tired image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a house: the biggest clich√© on today's screens. It is possible that I will give this series one more chance, but human cartoons alone will not keep me tuned. As James Hilton once lamented: "A story, please, just give me a story."
