In the cinema, I feel that it should be something more than art. I think it should be more than that, a way of telling a story on screen. This short by David Lynch tells a story but not much. I felt it was funny but too strange to be a comedy. It's a good movie, but there really is not anything else. As I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch but I feel frustrated by his work because I do not see the need to do it. This is definitely the least favorite thing I've done so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I'm excited to see what he has for us in the future. If you like Lynch, look at this but do not be surprised when you do not like it very much.
