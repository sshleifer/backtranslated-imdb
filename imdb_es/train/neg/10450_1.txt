This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I was laughing through the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would look for a particular section of the body of the passengers to attack, for example, the eye, the tongue, the back, the chest. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes will not stay close to the body once they bite. For each scene in particular, the snakes bit the passengers and remained in the body biting the person. I think the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie. Therefore, I do not recommend the confidence of this movie, just wait until you're in the dollar theater or rent it.
