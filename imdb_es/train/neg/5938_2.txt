If you did not live in the 90s or you did not listen to the rapper EVER! This movie could be fine for you, but for any fan or anyone who has heard rap, this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said that is interesting or that I did not know it. another thing that bothered me was that it seemed that everything he had done in his life was very easy, there was no struggle that made it seem easy to prison, selling drugs, and even rape was not realistic. I think if the film were to be released in about 15 years from now, it might have more impact! Good rap movies rush and flow, enrich or die trying not to be notorious
