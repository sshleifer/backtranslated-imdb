I'm waiting for the same emotion that I put in your grave, but I was disappointed by the junk, how can you call this movie (is it a kind of mini porn)? I got sick when the boy was made to eat his own business. There is no argument at all that I jump quickly from each murder. If you like to see a naked woman or even with male parts, then there are places in the movie and there is even a point of masturbation in the movie that makes it into a porn movie and not a movie. I've seen some silly movies in my time, but this is number 1. I want to see it again. The actors even look bored during the movie for me, so they probably needed a lot of money to make this movie.
