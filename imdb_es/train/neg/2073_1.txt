Oh my God. Oh my God, I can not get over this movie. It was frightening. Horrible terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cents container. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've seen in my life. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Be real that sounds like a kind of new Barbie doll ... Super women? Are you kidding me. It was so false, false, false, fake. The people of the city did not seem to care that there was a flying blonde who was walking around the city saving a fire ... Oh, great! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did I do it? Does the movie seem offensive? I guess what you need to be a super hero is a pair of double D's, flowing blond hair, no glasses and a tight leather-skin suit ?! <br /> <br /> If I was trying to be romantic ... God, I do not know. It was horrible, if love meant taking someone to an art show and having sex in a bed And in the air ... what they had love! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything was too fast. First, that guy was single, what he was dating with G-girl ... what they broke, what went out with that Hannah girl ... and ... just keeps going. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me wonder ... How the hell did they get this in theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
