I really do not understand how people made this movie and I thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more disconcerting are those who watched this movie without feeling cheated for 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the sofa or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, they could surely find 2 real Irish people, and some attractive women who could offer their lines better than the filthy and chubby porn stars scattered throughout this movie. Of course, the gore works, but strangely enough, it is not as disturbing as one might think when seeing the organs torn from the hot (previously) tense bodies of porn stars, left and right. It probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrible inhuman performance you just want them to die of pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not mind anything about the following: <br /> <br /> - acting (seriously, they all sucked in. I've never seen this before, they ALL sucked). <br /> <br /> -plot (some horror movies are remotely linear, or at least surprising.) This movie makes no sense unless you're as shattered as the writers obviously were. <br /> <br / > - theme (nothing to learn from this film, there is nothing to fear in bed at night, nothing to contemplate, understand or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap, music as ordinary and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - landscape (it could have been the salvation of this film, but not ... nothing nice here, even the rocks are fake). /> <br /> Then, yes, if you do not mind that, and you're just a horny teenager with bad musical taste and "woman", this movie is for you Positive comments: interesting cinematography sometimes, wasted on the other elements Gore very realistic, again, wasted, but the bowel scene is classic, I agree that mutant unraveling e solves the problem of false accent.
