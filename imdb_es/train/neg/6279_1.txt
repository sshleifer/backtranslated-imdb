No, <br /> <br /> You're basically seeing something that does not make sense. So as not to spoil the film for the people who really want this, take a look at the movie. I will explain the story. <br /> <br /> A normal woman every day, walks down a street and then finds herself driving. her own car She follows her and many events take place during that time that includes her and her family. <br /> <br /> I made an account specifically to comment on this movie, about how horribly written this was. The performance was excellent, the events were great, but the story just did not take it anywhere, it could add tremendously and become a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by doing this, usually at the end of the movies, most of his questions get answers, but this movie asks him: What just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes have not past? <Br /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would enter our world and kill us. It was not elaborated especially during the movie, and you never know how it happened or why it happened or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not have been the main character. At the end of the film, the boy who finally realizes everything and runs away (his sister's boyfriend) should have been the main character, but unfortunately the film ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, I threw it right after ... do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing like this is done again.
