Maybe I would give 6 or 7 to this propaganda movie because it shows when and how a propaganda movie is successful. If there are people who see this piece and think "well, then the Jews must have done something to be treated like they were in World War II", then the film is very well made to hide "why" and "how" and "mix" correctly. and the false observations about how a people live. What else can a propaganda film aspire to? The part that includes an American film about the Rothschild family is very cleverly reused here, for example. The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the tax system within that particular social stratum. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of emotion (or the level of disgust) in the film increases slowly and the end of the film's solution adapts. The purpose and duties of advertising. The audience would leave with joy and gratitude to the times ahead ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The movie is a kind of story nowadays, so you do not have to worry much about that really. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer may find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization, as well as problems of integration. In general, good garbage.
