Tobe Hooper has made great movies, so I was sure this could not be BAD. I did not read any criticism and tried to see this film involuntarily humorous. Sometimes this made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I almost cried for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I qualified this 3/10 because its 1990 "horror" movie and many interesting or funny things happened. there. Throughout the film, I thought of something like "you just CAN NOT add more things in this movie ..." ... but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say that this is a kind of Firestarter clone, but in reality it is not. It's based on that idea, but that's it. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / godly things, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, incredible script ... and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * The story is: The government tries to create a definitive weapon that uses nuclear energy or something and fails, during the process the child is born for 2 people. When the mother sings to her son after childbirth, both husband and wife burn and it is a SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. The government buries everything and lets this child live among other people and ... after x years, this child has grown up and realizes that he was born for a reason and that he can burn things with his brain. Then, everything becomes incredible, nothing messy really explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes that "it's okay, now it can make this fire thing work", they take it to a normal hospital, where there is something of nuclear toxicity that they are going to use with this man BECAUSE they could kill him, no, they can not shoot him, no! .. and argh, I guess that's enough to say, I promise there are 100 strangest things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want a good laugh, look at this one. Gosh
