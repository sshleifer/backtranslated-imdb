There seems to be a surprisingly high number of comments from 8 to 10 stars from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since. Given the very low average rating given to the movie by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I'll admit it, I thought the concept was nice, and I was pleased to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony in Angel at work, but it was not long before the sheer evil of this movie came true. known. <br /> <br /> Acting: The clues seemed competent enough, but all the others? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Parcel: Filled with holes large enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Address: It does not exist. <br /> <br /> Humor: Did they do it? Do you really think that people were going to laugh? Oh boy <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. There were some really beautiful women in this movie. Not only the three main female characters, but the entire board. It was as if the producers expected the stage to keep the male spectators so distracted that they would not realize how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands, this could have been a cute but dark camp classic. I was not even close.
