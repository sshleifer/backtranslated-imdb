Against All Hope is a very bad movie, sometimes painful. This is Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows, he's not that good at that. Some people may find the story laughable; An alcoholic realizes that his life and family are falling apart, so he calls a preacher as a last resort of help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> I actually found many of the religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church but moves away from it, quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is breaking and he tries to get help, but he realizes that only God can help him. In the end, he realizes that with the help of God he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well made. The acting is bad, the script could be useful and it seems worse than the videos of my house, but it has a good message. Now, the fact that he becomes a Christian does not mean that he can automatically stop an addiction or heal his broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track. In general, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate how this film portrays Christianity and, if you are not, you may be called to find out more about the faith.
