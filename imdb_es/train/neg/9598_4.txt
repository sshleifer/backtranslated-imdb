Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known around the world as a globetrotting television reporter. Lesser known but equally hard are his exploits as a full-time defender. <br /> <br /> I watched 'Vivre pour Vivre' dubbed in English with the title 'Live for Life'. Some life! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a lover who is dating, another who is on the way and the wife cheated at home. It helps that Robert is a liar glib. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "My work took more time than planned." He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for his succession of links. You wonder when this man will be stuck with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some may find their life exciting, but I thought it would be tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and so deceptive that one wonders if he is enjoying all this. <br /> <br /> Adding to boredom is a considerable amount of images that do not favor the plot. There are extended sections without dialogue or only in French. We see documentaries of wars, torture and training of troops interspersed with live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and travel by taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is the most prominent artist in this film. His was the most interesting character and he played perfectly. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can not find flaws in Yves Montand's interpretation of what was basically an amoral bum. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the novel techniques of Claude Lelouch. In the scene of a hotel room, the camera revolves around the room while Robert and his lover argue. We see them briefly during each step in the room. In another scene set in a train car, Robert is lying on the upper bunk, while his wife is at the bottom. Robert is giving his wife an important but distressing news, but we only hear some parts due to the noise of the train. I felt that his wife was also unable to absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The photography of those scenes and those of Amsterdam was excellent. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I have called the FIFTY project: 50 remarkable films forgotten in 50 years. The best I can determine, this movie, like the other forty-nine that I have identified, has not been in video, broadcast or distributed in the US. UU Since its original release. In my opinion, it is worthy to be available again. <br /> <br />
