I question its importance for Queer Cinema, since it seems to have more to do with having a homosexual encounter through violent behavior than to make clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories become entangled in a rather careless way. I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes, that just did not sit well with me. The weak points of the plot repeated infinitely, as if we had not been able to obtain them the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of quilted dialogue throughout the film. More like a 45-minute short of Boy's Brief instead of an extensive feature film. He had a certain erotic style, male nudity and sexual attractiveness, but in general the sum was not equal to its parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: the Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest and yet it also felt like it had been pulled thin Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting I felt as if his game of cat and mouse was not developed enough to merit his conclusion. We needed more information about them and fewer parking scenes / lockers with Tim saying relentlessly "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to hit him while he leaves. Tony does not seem to mind, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby, even after they've done it naked. This story lacks the all-important transition from "I'm a straight guy who hits my friend for fun" to "I think I can be gay and hit him because I'd like to open his ass and do it S / M style." A very important thing to put aside. <br /> <br /> Clearly, these stories could have transmitted their points in half the time. The third part, with the man and woman slapping, adds to that thought. Also, it was unnecessary and did not add anything to the movie. Yes, the actors did a good job in these circumstances and the four protagonists were very sensual. The makeup (bruises and cuts), however, was on par with a grammar school talent program. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat in this story to have any impact on gay politics. The film made no statement, wasted time and is not attractive or valuable enough for a careful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateur approach, which makes it ultimately impossible to take it seriously.
