Somehow, the concept behind the story was a pretty interesting mix of several typical types of movies in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve persistent close-ups. I felt as if I had been hit in the head with the so-called mysterious explanation of the disease that kills people. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to have simply removed the clich√©s from other films as a substitute for adapted writing lines. to the real characters. The actors did not help things. Not chemistry I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction, if only for the reason that it is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did not work very hard to develop the chemistry. Of course, both are attractive, but if they are attractive to each other it seems to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The confidence shown by Turner's character in Sabato developed too quickly and for no particular reason. The character of Sabato is supposed to be a discredited doctor who simply does not seem to follow the rules. Think of the character of Jeff Goldblum on "Independence Day." Generally, that type of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance. Sabato's character does not do it. It's Cassandra alone with the madness and all the prophetic abilities of a magic eight ball. It seems to be right to chance. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are funny. Each actor was really trying to demonstrate the agony inflicted upon them. The symptoms seemed a bad manifestation, something like that video of the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
