Egyptian films have many films with a high level of drama or romance or comedy or action, even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it had nudes (full frontal nudity) and this guy Nudity is forbidden in Egyptian movies. When I saw these films, I felt bad ... Fool Story ... Nude actress ... Bad action ... A bit of horror and horrible colors ... Dear friend ... If you want to see a great Egyptian movie .. Simply: stay away from the form "Ziab the Ta'Kohl AL lam" ... We have great movies in Egypt ... We have great actors who won a series of world victories like: Omar The Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin", so believe me Pall ... You do not need to see this movie ...
