I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I was not attracted even for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They released all the topics that occurred to them in the hope that something would stay. I would bet (and hope) that everyone involved in the Masters look back with shame. There are some great actors here, but you would never know. Thank God it did not destroy the careers of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. Here there was no vision, there was no work of love, only a horrible effort went wrong. By the way, I do not think the writer has set foot in a real school.
