If 1977's "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what the extraordinary actor Richard Burton saw in this monotonous exercise of no emotion. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age that he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through the force of his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays as recycled products, although the special effects at the end of the cathedral are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but, otherwise, the cast is extremely weak. Burton is crazy but tired ... not even telekinesis could save him right now. * 1/2 of ****
