A lost train. A wrong phone number An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people do not think about it because they are absorbed in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Event" tells the story of the interrelationships and cause and effect of the mundane when it comes to a group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what goes through contemporary theater, with the complete cast of dysfunctional and disillusioned. <br /> <br /> There is an unfaithful husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic bum, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish partner and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou is the former protagonist (in the sense that she is on the camera as much as any other person and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl who can not seem to find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <br /> She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope has for her. What happens to him throughout the day is told through several characters. Is the prediction true? The concept is good, but the narrative is weak. Connections from one event to another are weak. There is a better 15-second narrative of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial, where one person sees a good action and passes it to another in two hours of Happenstance. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice the time for this movie, but you will end up unsatisfied and wonder what this story could be if it were handled by a better producer and director.
