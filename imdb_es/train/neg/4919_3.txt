['Rarely has I been bothered by a leading performance like that of Ali McGraw in this film. God is she upset or what? She says it all in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, on the contrary, Ryan O&#39;Neal is brilliant. <br /><br /> There is not much history. He is rich, she is made of wood, both have to sacrifice a lot for love. Her father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is called her, in case you have not noticed the difference between the two who won in the name of love. <br /><br /> The Oscar nominations for this film indicate that it must have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wooden&#39;s father, but a supporting nomination? At least Ali did not win. <br /><br /> I still believe that Katharine Ross should have played with Jennifer, but, again, if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in many more movies. She is certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /><br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, it never occurred to me to even feel sad. <br /><br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones at about 15 years old, and the score is good. But this one is so old now that he has a beard a mile long, and the sin of that is not so old, but he feels it.']
