Unfortunately, this movie, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only good thing about the photo was 'Mike Myers', which was a pleasure to see. 'Neve Cambpell', although his role was small, unfortunately, it was bad. The conclusion is that this film lacked a good performance of the actors, except one and that the conversion of the real story was a desperate attempt for a good script.
