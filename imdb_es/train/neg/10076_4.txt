The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease was established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn, one of the four cast members who repeats his roles, approaches young Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton does not explain the pattern of foreign speech of St. John, here it is explained that Caulfield is his cousin. What is Conn doing at school? I think she likes to go for Rydell High, although now she's a beautician. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is an intelligent child, so, of course, the types of hoods that Adrian Zmed runs have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd is simply not going to cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to stage a modern Fox. Get a discarded bicycle, put it back together and teach yourself to walk. He puts on a leather motorcycle suit with glasses to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will have no problem making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he is equipped. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and initiated them The successful career paths that both have enjoyed. If you watched Grease's first film, a much better movie, you definitely have an idea of ​​how this film will turn out. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all members of the original Grease faculty are back in their roles. The music is not remotely as good as the songs that come from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not so good.
