Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most (most!) Open-minded movie viewers ... Films are my passion, and I'm a big regular at my local cult movie rental. .. I also feel the need to add that I am often asked for advice about films when I get there, and it seems I can never leave the place without having an elaborate discussion or an exchange of ideas about what is happening in the movie theater area. I love ... I love renting strange things, and that's exactly why one of the cult movie guys recommended this movie. He told me he thought he had to see this. , and as the cover said something about it was a movie with a Jodorowsky atmosphere (one of my favorites!), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not really fair, because I did not do it. I think it was horrible, I just did not know how to rate it in any other way. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made my stomach sick: I felt physically sick! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? I still did not want to turn it off, or maybe I just could not because I was fascinated in an unpleasant way ... <br /> <br /> I do not want to see this movie ever again. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, a 1 like I said. It's just not my cup of tea (or wodka, for that matter) ...
