This was possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. I saw him with a large group of friends and after he finished, none of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of argument, the performance was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only redeeming factor of the movie is that it is so incredibly bad that it is quite funny. You can not help but laugh at a zombie being run over while the actors are spitting up crappy dialogues. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something a group of friends can get together and laugh a lot. Now it's a joke between my friends and me. 1 out of 10
