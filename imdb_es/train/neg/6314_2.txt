I love Seth Green. His appearances on THat 70s' Show are always worth it, but last night I felt it was necessary to modify the show. Four young singles inherit an apartment in New York City that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been an heiress to have that space in the first place. So I felt that the need for realism should have been removed. Anyway, the plot about four best friends who got this apartment was not credible. I would have loved that they had to move with one of their parents, which would have given them a great sense of humor and a lack of functionality regarding the configuration of the show. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I'm just seeing it because it falls before My name is Earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, discard this series and start over. We need more family series involved. What if Seth and his friends move in with their crazy parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place? They could have Dabney Coleman play with the father and Christine Estabrook, play with the dysfunctional mother and siblings. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is infinite and the network is overflowing.
