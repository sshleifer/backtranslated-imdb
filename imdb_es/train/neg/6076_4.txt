In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? The problem with this type of role is that De Niro has played with very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and, unfortunately, the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard had started out as an obsessive and frustrated sports fan in becoming a psychopath out. <br /> <br /> The arc of the characters is not the only problem with this script. a character approach (a problem I had with THE UNTOUCHUCHLES in which De Niro should have been excellent, but ended up a little flat), during several sections of the film I thought that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story returns to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who seem to think that this should have focused a bit more on baseball. Originally, I'm not sure if this was intended for baseball fans, but again, there are elements that suggest that it might have been if the producers had decided who and what the story should focus on. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was entertained with THE FAN (especially for the soundtrack) but it is a very defective movie and it must be remembered that by the mid-1990s, the characters were harassed by crazy people as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, INCREDIBLE ENTRY, etc. . steam long ago
