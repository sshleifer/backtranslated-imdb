There are beautiful landscapes shots. Writers who put trite snacks in the mouths of actors. With minor actors this show would be silly. 'Art must elevate humanity or it is BS'. It is not so because the art of all those mentioned is also to shake humanity and express the dark side. The main character even says that those who do not drink hide the side of the shadow. Wrong, he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one-dimensional, not expanding his horizons with anything other than landscapes. There was no breathing organism in his work or expression of his pain. All the artist did was limit himself to ten cents of landscapes. The discussions between the characters were in elementary school, always trite things giving the only character the advantage that the writer wanted. I tried to like it after reading all the first comments of wow here. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I guess the great comments were from those connected to the movie. I was moved only once towards the end. The boy was too passive. The scenery was beautiful and the music ridiculous. Only my opinion, but it is not shown anywhere for me.
