I did not think it was possible, but I found a movie worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really very bad! And what makes it worse is that it's another Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80s rock soundtrack, it keeps getting worse and worse, which It is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is (someone with skin hanging upside down in a room with white tomato sauce?). <br /> <br /> And why do they change their accents? From the bad accent of New York, to the choppy English, to the pure Aussie! And it happens to the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This movie also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). This has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would nominate this at all (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think it's too bad for that too). <br /> <br /> Come on guys! This movie has to be number 1 in the bottom 100! It has to be ten times worse than the movies that are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to the "filmmakers" of this garbage, to prove that there is a reason not to watch movies ... 0/10
