Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre 'B' mystery was one of five films released in 1942 with Simon as director . Surely he could have embedded another Red Skelton movie or two in his diary! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a shameless scam of Thin Man movies minus the wit, charm and chemistry of the leads. They give us a thin plot that can barely stand their 73 minutes, bad performance and tired gags. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Charer, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a private investigator and she is his wife and his partner. They engage in "humorous" jokes with each other. Watch? It is completely different. Heflin is the only one here who insinuates bigger and better things, although he is very close to being an imbecile in this. Virginia Gray was in Another Thin Man, but once again, let me emphasize, THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT, no sir. And, just in case, we started thinking that this movie does not look anything like another movie (for example, THE THIN MAN) that we really like, Sam Levene appears as the leading detective who is a bit weak and has to have Van Heflin to direct it subtly towards All important clues. Hmmm <br /> <br /> Quickly, the 'murder' is that of the evil machinist Mida King, who likes to trade with rich men until he finds an even richer one. She is played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and becomes an F. There is a whole series of crazy suspects, all with their own motivation to love Mida dead. There's the kind of society, the hard-talking ladies, the bully, the ex-lover and a grim theater entrepreneur (Tom Conway, here loaded with the unlikely character name of 'Frankie Ciro'). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous and nervous guy, something I think he could have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who, in a gag that does not give up, can not stop thinking about the piece of ass that is waiting for him once this case closes (that's right, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely innovative storytelling method, something we have never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in a place where they tell their stories (like flashbacks) to the detective, while Rocky takes mental notes, until finally the guilty person is bound to release a confession dramatically. <br /> <br /> At the top of the real picture as a failure, I naively thought that there might be a couple of photos of the location of the Epoch Times of the 1942 Central era, but alas, no. There is only a very short shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to summarize, a little formula, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
