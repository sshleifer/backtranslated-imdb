One wonders why someone would try to repeat the successful arguments of films that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. "The date of the wedding" is one of the best examples of why not try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been left alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the approval of the great studio honchos, then do everything possible with big stars and brilliant production values, that way, people will come by the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that is not what happens in this wrong comedy attempt. The problem seems to be the way that screen writers have transplanted the story to London, when, basically, this seems to be a typical situation in the United States that even the environment can not fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> As Kat and Nick have no conflicts from the beginning, the viewer is not involved in the film the way the creators thought it would be. It is clear that Kat will fall in love with Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset of "Junebug", is presented as a superficial girl who is willing to keep her lie and does not clarify the man who loves her and who is going to marry her. <br /> <br /> For anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film last almost seven minutes!
