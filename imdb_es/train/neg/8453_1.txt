['This film is a confusing mix of recent film clich√©s. There are some promising ideas there, but while the director was clearly aiming to end a disturbingly ambiguous film, what ended was a confusing mess. The main actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but without a central theme, it seems that he does not have much to work with. In addition, the film is largely devoid of fears (although, to be fair, there are some creepy moments in the midst of monotony). <br /><br /> * SPOILERS LEVE * <br /><br /> We have the mysterious death of a separated twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death of wild monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality and gang connections of criminals. The only common element that these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that despite the death of the monkeys by the presence of the monkeys on the cover of the DVD, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be monkeys, not terrifying. <br /><br /> * END OF SPOILERS * <br /><br /> Avoid this one To see an excellent tale of psychological and ambiguous terror, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).']
