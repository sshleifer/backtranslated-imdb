This small and solid horror movie is actually one of the best of Renny Harlin. The story is pretty routine, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive; in fact, the ghost story is almost a late occurrence. The real horror comes from the environment of the prison, and Renny H. does not skimp on showing us how bad the conditions are inside that old, crumbling hell, leaking and infested with rats (with a sadistic director too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as Usually, in the main role, supported by some very authentic looking prisoners (there are no handsome guys in this cast). Fans of horror should verify this.
