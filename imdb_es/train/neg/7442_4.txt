Sorry, this movie did not scare me, it just bothered me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all that, fell in the way. Children! The father! The premonition! He had so much potential and ziltch! zero nothing I've heard everything before. Scary! Do not! I can be scared alone, here where I feel, of what they could in the movie. Are there men who write that figure that women should be so annoying? Eh This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been, if the director / writer had bothered to work it. We could have had good music that would have also increased the tension, if someone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they get the money? Just give it to me and save all that trouble. Abandoned? ... We were not betrayed.
