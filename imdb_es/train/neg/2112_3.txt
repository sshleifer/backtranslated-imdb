Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to make his wife look young and beautiful. To this end, he drug brides during their wedding ceremonies so that they look like they are dead so he can steal their bodies. I'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies. I do not remember ever having explained it completely. All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects it into his wife. (I'll only guess it's spinal fluid, the spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s). You can guess the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There is a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I will only write about two) of the problems I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Sure, he does a pretty decent job in his own exaggerated way (BTW, the rest of the cast is just abysmal). But having it hidden in the back of a hearse or having it enter the reporter's bedroom so it does not do anything is silly. Also, why has he hit and / or killed all the henchmen he has? Is it to make him look evil? Well, someone who is kidnapping comatose girlfriends does not need to be made to look more evil. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​drugging brides. Why brides? Would not a woman younger than 20 years old? Seeing Bela going through these turns to get his victims, I remembered the idiot Fisherman in I still know what you did last summer. In each case, there seems to be an easier way to achieve your goal than to employ a seemingly impossible plan that depends a lot on circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, an alternative title for this film is The Case of Missing Brides, which I suppose explains in part the need for 'brides').
