This seems one of those movies that we think we should like, but I did not. He seemed to be trying too hard to be "artistic". All flash, without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and any of them is nice to see, but putting them all together and it becomes an arduous task to simply sit through them. I rented this because of the enthusiastic comments in the video box, and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I found it a bit pretentious and, sometimes, boring.
