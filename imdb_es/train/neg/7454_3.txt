I like the cast a lot but the story develops rather slowly. Danny Glover does a good job making you wonder if he is the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have as much space in history as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit exaggerated compared to how the story unfolds. Although I would see it again. I rated it with a 5 (I'd like to qualify it with a 5.5)
