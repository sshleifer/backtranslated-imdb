After reading the other reviews of this film, I think that the most important bookmarks are probably paid for by studio lackeys, since the movie I saw was absolutely terrible, with wooden performances, tarnished scripts and a predictable and laborious direction, one Of the few positive points it has to Be the impressive scenery, since this film has some amazing backgrounds with great views, spectacular skies and open meadows. Unfortunately, when the most memorable part of a movie is the part that appears behind the actors, this should be a warning signal in terms of quality. Of the film, in general, a totally boring addition to the Western genre, which even at a very reasonable price that can be obtained on DVD, it is better to avoid.
