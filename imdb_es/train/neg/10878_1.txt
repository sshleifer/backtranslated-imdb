This movie is so much a scam of the "demons" of masterpeice and that's the only thing that makes it worthwhile to watch the movie. The acting is terrible, the scenes of action are accelerated, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, then you have not seen a real horror movie, skip it. and get a copy of the movie's demons.
