Spooks is a nice garbage, with some well-directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogues, and a third-class performance. <br /> <br /> Many have described this as a UK version of "24", and one can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the silly and weak plots, but the execution is much more ingenious, sexier and I suspect that it is expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe the weak comedy as "soft comedy". <br /> <br /> This is the time of the soft spy story, exactly the opposite of everything created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley any day.
