I know it's a Power-Ranger trick and it's aimed at 7-year-olds, but really, why did they take themselves seriously with this movie? If you are going to write a plot with crayons, at least have the decency to make it silly. It's a little funny if you see this. We have a typical family full of clich√© characters (father, a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself for LOLOL), hollow-headed children trying to fill the stereotype but fail with a horrible performance, and a partner ridiculously horrible that it is useless. to the movie but to fill the space of the camera. Fun things! <br /> <br /> However, the big moment is nearing the end when the father of the war and the bad acting villain try to fight on a sword, but then realize that none of them knows how (probably because there's no room in the budget for choreographers), so they come up with this American Gladiator-type setup to run. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously.
