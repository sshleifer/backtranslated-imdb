I think I saw this movie, but do not cite me, since it is possible that I fell asleep while watching it, since it did not "catch my emotion and my imagination". At least I know I saw enough to know that I will not see him again soon. Or never. <br /> <br /> My God, talk about lame ... I'm really lame. Totally lame. I would not even attract a six-year-old boy. Basically it did not have a dramatic impact that is worth Zilch. Nothing Only shlock became a dreck. Comedy? What was supposed to be a comedy? You could have tricked me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie "Critters", we could have made the human characters do something a little deeper than being overly presumptuously young ... like shouting, yelling and run for their lives so they do not eat them, so the story could be something more exciting than seeing paint dry. <br /> <br /> Do not bother looking at this one. It's not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. How to see the dry paint. Or falling asleep.
