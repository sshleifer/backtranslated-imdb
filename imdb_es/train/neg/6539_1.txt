If this could be qualified with a 0, it would be. From the atrocious performance of the wood to the dull and heavy rhythm, the puerile exploitation angle and the pseudolesbian excitement of sophomorism added purely for the sad spectators, this is a disaster of a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, since from the beginning one is absolutely sure of what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring and unusual beginning to a pathetic and somber end, every presence in this film is wasted, and every little amount of talent unearthed for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something so relentlessly gloomy with the same childhood excitement, see one of Ilsa's films. At least they do not apologize in advance about what they are trying to do. How something so horribly bad managed to be qualified above a 5 is a miracle of how people without tastes or exacting standards can sometimes join for the most dubious purposes. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, it is not interesting, and above all it is not exciting in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that a piece of garbage so horribly offensive and incompetent has been conceived and given the resources to arise, and even more so a tragedy that is still defended by some unfortunately mistaken spectators. <br /> <br /> Not even Elvira's cheerful personality and her joking ways could soften the blow that this horrible movie parody is. Avoid at all costs.
