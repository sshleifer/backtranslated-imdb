Recently, I have been obsessing and anticipating this movie so much that I almost had to see it. Well, having seen it today, the rating of 5.8 is completely understandable. I think that if you anticipate something that becomes an extreme necessity, it turns out that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very interesting and well-developed story that relates well to the product itself, but everything is so self-indulgent that it becomes so difficult to follow. And if it were not for Wes Craven's production in this movie, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But all this makes you go "Is this supposed to be a horror or a COMEDY?" because there are many ridiculous jumping moments, placed at random and stylized lines (IE "There is a hand in the gun **!" or "My mother ** er! I will kill you all, damn children of b ** tches" and acting (God does not remind me how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, beware!) The movie begins with a woman who gives birth to a mutant baby (ooh la the!), and then the screen fades to black with the title of the film appearing, and a monologue, then we go to this office where there are mannequins of randomly placed war veterans.We find that this is for this only scientist who follows the track of people looking for mutants The box to track the audio transmissions disappeared and everyone died After that opening tone, you would wait for more. <br /> <br /> Then, let's go to this team. of military recruits in Baghdad, while the captain parades them "A good job in the stupidity ", his last day of training is in New Mexico, the desert where the family had stayed in the last place. use were stuck. While I train, things go wrong, people die and ... do I need to tell you something else? Because right now I have the attention capacity of a golden fish that forces me to sit here and write this. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with THHE2 is that it simply does not work. There are no flashbacks here, and the end is pretty sure ... but with a touch! A stupid one, that's it. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will present all its alternative endings, but at this point, I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> So, of course, if you loved the first THHE so much that it's almost a sin not to see this, then, of course, look at it. But if not, then, avoid it at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
