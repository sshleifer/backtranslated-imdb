This movie is pure guano. Mom always said that if you can not say anything good ... but even mom would say that I had to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes would simply disappear. I hope Greg Kinnear dismisses his agent ... from a cannon for giving him the script. After this, Ben Stiller probably prays for someone to throw "There's still something about Mary". I've always been a fan of Wes Studi, thanks to everything you feel saint for wearing a mask throughout the film so that maybe people will not identify the film with him. <br /> <br /> Start in a promising way with a style. parody of the cinematography of the Batman movies and then simply lose something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the auction line arrives, and even then they fall. . If you want to see an effective parody of the world of comics, see "Chasing Amy." <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT BE PAID OF "MYSTERIOUS MEN"!
