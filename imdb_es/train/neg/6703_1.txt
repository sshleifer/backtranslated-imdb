I realized that this movie has received the brunt of many insults. Probably won some of them, but it was not so bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, it tried to tell a story. As a drama, this movie could work really well. I just think that the filmmakers did not understand what path to take when they did this (they should have added more comic pieces if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a great movie. But as a satire, it did not work in its current form; many scenes did not fit in the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in history. However, it was not the worst independent film ever made, is it in the Top 10 Worst? That is debatable.
