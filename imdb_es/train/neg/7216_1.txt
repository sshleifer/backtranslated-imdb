I love westerns. I could watch them all day. "The good, the bad and the ugly" is my favorite of all times. I saw "Silverado" probably for the eighth time the other day because he showed up at the CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls, is undoubtedly the worst western I've seen in my life. The acting was terrible everywhere. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass. The only good thing I can think about is the beautiful canteen. The long and noticeable pauses between the dialogue seemed to be intentional only to recover the time necessary to make the film have an acceptable duration. This movie was not even worth the rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt that I had been robbed and deserved a rental refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I ended up was because I hate not watching a movie until the end. I turned it off in half because it was very bad. To the director, do a better job if you decide to do another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people into westerns.
