I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to put on a banana peel and become the best detective in history. <br /> <br /> But the movie has ruined the reputation of the wonderful caricature. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, definitely was not the role of Inspector Gadget. The first thing: in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. It is not like that in the cartoon. In the movie, Gadget solves the mystery mainly by himself. In the caricature, it was almost always about Penny, Brain and the incredible book (I still want your book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon it was pretty silly, that was where the humor came from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it's too "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It's not just a Saturday morning caricature. Also, Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the real gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the caricature it was a police sedan and could become a van. He also had almost no device and was mainly there to take him from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But in any case, the only thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a Saturday morning caricature. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, it had too much plot and it was not even remotely that funny. <br /> <br /> Suggestion for those who have not seen it: NEVER see it. FOREVER. Look at the caricature, it's a true classic.
