This movie is an excellent example of wasting great resources in a movie. You have the future stars of SNL and SCTV in their heyday, like John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, who do 70 minutes of uninspired racist farts and jokes. The concept of a network of the future subverted society could have been really taken to some interesting extremes, but instead, it makes a joke of juvenile proctology and stays in that line of humor all the way. Groove Tube, much more subversive and witty, or the hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of the bad comedy movies of the 70s.
