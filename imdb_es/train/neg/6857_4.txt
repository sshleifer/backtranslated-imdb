This "crazy comedy" seems very forced. In fact, TRY actors are very difficult to do with a script essentially without grace. And, as a result, it really does not go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman discovering she was pregnant after getting a quick divorce is not so funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks in with the baby because he does not want to be put up for adoption, it seems awfully distracting and he's really pushing to turn this into a comedy. It's also really a shame, since the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself bored by the whole mess. Considering that Cooper made so many good comedies, I recommend you see them.
