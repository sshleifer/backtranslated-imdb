An interesting idea and a story that did not work at all. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you may feel as dissatisfied with the ending as I did. I really did not know who to support in the movie, Taye Diggs seemed bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been more of a good girl, we could have enjoyed seeing the development of the plot and the perpetrator brought to justice. The problem was that she was as malicious as the other girls, that she went from being a sweet girl to an opportunistic cocaine accomplice. I can not understand the moral message of this movie, and like a detective story and a thriller does not work.
