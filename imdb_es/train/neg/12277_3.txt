I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a bargain box and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. Friends, there is a reason why you do not listen much about this movie. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is as lively as the cold tofu, and the end leaves you aimless. Not even Sean Connery can save this one.
