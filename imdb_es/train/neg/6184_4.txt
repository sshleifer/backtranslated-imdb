Brainless movie about a beautiful couple without a brain that decides to live their dream and take people on diving excursions. The couple almost instantly makes the wrong decision of the customers and gets confused with some people looking to recover the items we see falling to the bottom of the ocean during the opening credit sequence. The good straight look of a video movie could have been much better if you were not so interested in looking good. The presentations are useful and the plot is not really bad, or if the director and the producers had not redirected the plot to make sure that we see many well-formed people in swimsuits (or in what I guess is the reason for the "lack of qualification" "I nickname a few fleeting empty breasts." The film never generates any tension or rises above the level of a forgettable television movie.If you feel attracted to see this, you will not take your eyes off because the Eye candy is nice, but we really need to keep producers from making movies that are excuses for paid vacations.
