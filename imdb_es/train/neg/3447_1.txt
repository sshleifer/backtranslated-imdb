This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've seen. It is not scary or any of the other things suggested in the scheme of the plot. This movie is terribly slow and I got bored for almost all 98 minutes. While the performance is, at best, mediocre, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and laborious, without real direction. Occasionally, a strange environment is configured only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the whole cast was sick and vomited between shots, after all they had to try to digest a terrible script. As a fan of good horror movies, it always bothers me that something so bad is done. Save yourself 98 minutes, you'll never come back.
