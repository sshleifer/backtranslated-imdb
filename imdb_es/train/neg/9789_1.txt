They should have called this film: "Adopted a mouse brother who is slightly inspired by the vague memory of someone from Stuart Little, who just flipped through the book a little, but mostly just remembered the cover" If it were not so deceptive what It would be a better revision. <br /> <br /> But seriously, do your children a favor and have them read the book. They may learn something instead of their minds falling asleep with what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book that Stuart little is not about a mouse, but about a person who turns out to be very small and like the mouse He was born of his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the trip he embarks on. There is a cat called Snowball who thinks it's food and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> In the movie they ruin all that. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.
