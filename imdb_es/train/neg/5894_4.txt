How many centuries will pass until the Japanese / Asian horror films abandon the long-haired ghost woman? It is true that they managed to steal "Ringu" a million times and, often, it worked well, which shows that originality is not such an important requirement in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please? ). However, this time I found myself a bit restless, somewhat boring. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd duration of 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and emotion. Also, the ending is confusing: it does not make any sense at all. As for the ring tone: Miike could have devised a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing. Even though it was played a dozen times, I can not even remember it, that's how terrifying it was. Speaking of Miike, for him this is something like a commercial adventure, so if someone thinks that he might be suffering the perversion of the type "Bijita Q" or "Audici√≥n", he is wasting his time.
