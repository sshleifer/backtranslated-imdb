This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega, I did not expect much, but I did not expect this garbage either. To begin with, the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of moving. The motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Every time you run towards something, you just stay there and do not move. You never fall off the bicycle or you break apart. The main character barely speaks even though he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You walk through the trees on your bike. The camera makes it impossible to fight the enemy. This game would not even be worth renting.
