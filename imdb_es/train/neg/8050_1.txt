just below the surface lies what? A simply horrible movie is what it does. <br /> <br /> As other viewers have rightly commented, the storm sequences are simply ridiculous. Cutting wood already soaked in the torrential rain? Now that's smart, threat? feeling? sexual tension? For those who read boring and artificial, boring and artificial and boring and excessively artificial. <br /> <br /> I want to thank God for the shower scene of mia sara, but in retrospect, I think the producers of the film, having seen the full movie. Mess realized that they had to put something in it so that half the penalty was worth it. so it simply becomes another contraption. Do yourself a favor and do not miss it.
