However, another Die Hard directly to video theft with cardboard villains? How many more of these terribly cheap (and evil) gods made from the most popular action movies of the late '80s and early' 90s are still lurking? For the record (not that you really care) this is another flagrant theft of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a full complement of cliches and predictability. <br /> <br /> The non-descriptive villains are the usual selection of thugs of cut cartridges that are sent by various means as the movie progresses, the hero is of course a former policeman or something that has family problems and of attitude and, of course, it does not lead to the party. only the usual emotional baggage, but also a couple of candies and their annoying son. <br /> <br /> The supposed luxury cruise that runs between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a ship and a ferry. ?? Does this somehow explain why they seem to be loitering in a rusty ferry of crossed channels? In New Zealand! The performance is as wooden as the cover, the pitiful script, the predictable liners, the villains are completely inept and the plot has holes in which you can navigate a boat. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is never ending the tide of this type of scam directly to the video garbage that contaminates the night slots of the television and the DVD containers of the supermarkets everywhere (although even this movie it's so bad that a DVD has not yet been released, but give it time!) Is there any chance that something at least half decently done, semi-credible and most important is ORIGINAL? No, I did not think ?? ..
