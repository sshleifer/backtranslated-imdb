What F * @ # was this that I just saw? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is insatiably bad and silly. In a strange departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) against "vampire-like" creatures with superhuman strength. OK? Oh, and his eyes twinkle inhumanly? Woohoo! However, even in this movie, to stifle Seagals to have the last blow and no one can kick my ego, he is somehow stronger than them. However, all average humans are being crushed around them. Come on, I can understand the big neighborhood aggressor or the drug dealer, but these are superhuman people. Oh, and I understand this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity problems, because apparently, he and his movie mates think it's Wolverine. Oh My Go ... And worse than all that! Yes, there is something worse than that. He has a voice that even changes his voice in the middle of the sentence while we are looking at his face. Obviously, they do not look anything like him and I think he can be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always see a movie to finish. This is a historical minimum, even for your direct video movies to Steven. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Two thumbs down! Qualities redetermination? Well, I suppose so, I'll be fair in that respect. At least some of the special effects were fine, and I like the choice of costumes for the actors and actresses. The women were all quite attractive to IMO. Still, and I said STILL, it does not make up for the cheeky X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, the vampire movie here) scam! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be expelled and exiled from the film business. I think I feel what most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost all the other photos of Uwe Boll) about this movie. That's all my $ 1.00 in this movie. Look if you dare.
