I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, this film is very difficult to take seriously. It was at AMC one night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for some laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Special effects are about average for the period of time, they are not horrible, but they are not great either. Of course we know more about Mars now than before, but we really can not keep that against this movie. The main reason why I did not like this movie is the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this film that I wish would have been explored in a bit more detail: the injury / condition of the astronaut, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. In general, the film is very similar to a long episode of the 1960 version of The Outer Limits, which is completed with a cheesy ending.
