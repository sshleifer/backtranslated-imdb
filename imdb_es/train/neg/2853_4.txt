Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mafia boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny, it has a constellation in the cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ('Pleasure to kill you') <br /> <br />
