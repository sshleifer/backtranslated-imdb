This movie was fantastic, a great movie along with everything that is scary. and I mean that I got scared as much as the pulse and the computer and the omen, etc. But with a big movie, shit comes, right? RIGHT! This movie ending was pathetic. I mean, a ghost pushed back the time in a chick house and thinks that now that I've done it means that I can call her and that it will be the right time because she believes it is. Right? incorrect. My ass I do not care if the ghost is Satan, it just does not happen. It's a movie, but most of the evil movies or these kind of movies are meant to make sense, but it was not like that. He simply showed us what I just said and people do not think anything of that. Can someone tell me why they have not noticed that pathetic part? The movie for me ended up in the hospital and that's it. Check out number 3 its much more ass
