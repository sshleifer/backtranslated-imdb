Sitting down to watch the 14th season of Bachelor ("On the wings of love"), I knew I would be at an "interesting" time. I had seen some of the previous seasons of the Bachelor's degree go by; watching an episode or two and losing the next three or less. I find that the bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, although he often lacks quality and morality. <br /> <br /> "On the wings of love" details the journey made by Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas. , Texas, to find true love, a love as true as the one that can be found in a schedule of reality drama appointments of the entire season. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. Start to know them a little, but it's mostly superficial; How well can you meet someone in a few 5-minute conversations? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the beginning, at least to the audience. He noticed that he not only wants love or a good time, but also wants a fianc√© or wife. We can only assume that he has also made this clear to women in the competition. If that is the case, it could explain, to some extent, some of the actions of women. Women are super competitive. Although they do not even know Jake at all, they are still in this to win it no matter the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only were women competitive, but they were also confident and malicious. Threats, stabbings and warnings of "Beware!" They all show that these women were not there for a long time either. Jake noticed that he not only sought sexual attractiveness, but also sought "a connection". However, the girls did everything they could to impress Jake with such sex appeal. They arrived at the mansion in plain dresses? either low or short cut. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum, others missed that note altogether. One girl, Channy, noticed that Jake was a "good guy" for whom she could be a "naughty girl". He went on to say that Jake could land on his "track at any time". He obtained the weakness of the other girls for his provocative statement that showed his opinion on these situations. <br /> <br /> So, a reality dating show could not be that bad, right? In addition to the obvious problem of attraction driven by sex, there are other problems that affect this seemingly harmless show. Is this the right way to find a future partner? competing for the attention of someone flaunting oneself to extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, that is what the United States has reduced appointments these days: pleasure and sex without commitment and a little bit of happiness aside. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional bond by which many of the girls come together. Give them to Jake. Some girls in particular seemed too attached. One girl said: "If I do not have that first impression, Rose will kill me!" As mentioned above, they do not even know him and she was talking about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses to avoid being eliminated. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some problems with the attachment to Jake. The other girls also noticed it. After a fit of Michelle in particular, Vienna said that Michelle had a "mental crisis and we have only been here one hour". Michelle got the last rose of the night in the first show? Is the elimination almost missing? and he was extremely emotional about it. The other girls thought it was just ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and from there it just took off. TV reality. Show our entertainment interests as a country; If we were not watching the programs and giving them good grades, the networks would not continue to execute them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is hooked. One thing is clear: the United States (in general) loves reality television and its ensuing traps. <br /> <br /> This makes me wonder: why is it that we even like reality TV? What attracts us? Is it because we see the similarities with our own lives or because we want to make sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever attracts us, we must be careful with the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality shows are bad; however, I am saying that we must evaluate each of them. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2.
