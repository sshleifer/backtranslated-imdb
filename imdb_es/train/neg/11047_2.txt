There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie. One of the reasons is that some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) work, who tried to act on their generally good level of acting. However, in many scenes they were blocked in some way by the incorrect scripts. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the good idea and appearance of the Cyborg, which is quite different from most other similar roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, badly written works. And it seemed like it was the first movie for many actors. However, it could have been an interesting story, but they completely failed.
