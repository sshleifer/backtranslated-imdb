This classic film-blanc from 1997 on latent passion has reached its deserved legendary status as one of the best sagas on the screen of a condemned and hopeless love. The omnipresent, continuous and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and her name will surely make the heart of a spectator flow with the memories of his first infatuation. The brilliant script hangs this embryonic future in front of the tormented audience, immobile as the abstract, almost expressionist cinematography, centered on the desires just below the surface that flow and flow between the main ones. You can cut sexual tension with a dull tire sleeve. <br /> <br /> A small drop of sweat on the tip of the nose traps sunlight, and leaves no doubt about its importance. Scenes like this abound and you see them again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (with which this masterpiece is so often compared), the close-ups of the faces of the actors as they experience the slow dawn of the great love that is not the future will haunt you. forever. <br /> <br /> The RC soundtrack, now classic, with its creative and unique use of synthesizer alone, emphasizes the emotion that drips like a leaking crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism In any case, mentioning what I consider a minor flaw (and I dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who have this beloved classic in their hearts), I would say that the Distinctive hallmark of "Runaway Car" is your sexual sense. Tension - breaks briefly by the highway scene, which now after repeated looks seems a little too long (and probably even unnecessary?) to the eternal and bittersweet story of Love Interrupted. <br /> <br /> I dare to advance what is perceived as the smallest of the defects in this triumph acclaimed by the critics of modern cinema? 'Citizen Kane' had his 'Rosebud'. . . 'Runaway car' should also have its motto. Maybe the movie could have premiered with an extreme close-up of Judge Reinhold saying something like "A car is an extension of its owner!" And the rest of the story could be devoted to analyzing every syllable, subtlety and nuance of that phrase . . If that plot had been made, this film could have surpassed "Titanic" in the Golden Globes that year, I am convinced. <br /> <br /> My only regret? That I did not read the novel first.
