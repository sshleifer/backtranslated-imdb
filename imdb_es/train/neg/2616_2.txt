Remember the name of Kevin Lime and, please, never let <br /> <br /> redirect it. Timing, rhythm, editing: everything is totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, leave the set <br /> <br />) can not do anything to save this movie from fans like Alice <br /> <br /> Evans, and the kind of production standards you would expect from children's programs produced by teenagers on British television. <br /> <br /> The greatest mystery: music. A score so inept, inadequate and <br /> <br /> that does not match the tone of the film, that one wonders if it is a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic sound that sounds seemingly <br /> <br /> without engineering from a single microphone, and a director who only <br /> <br /> intermittently remembers to add auditory action off the screen, and we <br / > <br /> have what should be in the highest proportion of money as a result of <br /> <br /> in recent years.
