I have been watching many cartoons or animated movies because I have a girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I would like my little girl to see her ... and no. At first I thought it was a movie as beautiful as Bambi's movie, but so far it was like insinuating that the duckling was a homosexual. The information said that they were making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It seems like a movie made for children to learn to be well being homosexual. It was also very sad, as for the father of the duckling and everything. I do not know, I suppose if you're gay you'd like it, but I do not think I'll see him again with my little one.
