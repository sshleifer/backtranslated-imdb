(Spoilers) Wow, this is a bad one. I did a double take when I saw an old episode of Star Trek the other day, it was the one where everyone got infected with that discomfort from space and then they went a little crazy, and there was Stewart Moss, also known as the unfortunate 'hero' of It Lives. at night! He played the first member of the infected crew, who dies of terminal depression. All he could think was that he had seen his own movie too many times, that was what caused the depression. This movie is full of really unpleasant people. There is no redeeming character in the movie, not a single one. It's very hard to feel bad about the fact that Dr. Beck has turned into a bat (or whatever he actually became), because you just do not like him. And you do not like your rough, bony wife or the nasty sergeant. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So, why would you invest time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to worry about it. Not to mention the horrible cinematography, which seemed to have filmed the movie through urine, and the special effects of five bat cents, many of which looked like pieces of paper thrown in a fan to simulate hordes of flying bats. It's not the worst movie I've seen in MST3K, but down there in the lower ranks, definitely.
