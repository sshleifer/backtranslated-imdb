Hee hee hee This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day I saw this for the first time in MST. The sun was shining, it seemed like a good day. Then, I saw this product by Rick Sloane, which consisted of horrible plush dolls that wreaked havoc on the nasty 80s party. Kevin, extravagant, tries to impress his girlfriend, gets a job as security guard assistant, wrestles with rakes and many more things in this series of images so poorly made. No argument or story is needed. Obviously, no action is necessary as the movie proves. An army boy and his girl crazy for sex will make you want to jump off a cliff, and the dorky friend who has fun on the phone will make you say: "He has some cute red shorts." Also, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait until the Scum Club scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I advise that after seeing this movie, it is a good month to recover the senses and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
