Note to all the mad scientists around the world: if you are going to turn your child into a genetically mutated monster, you must give it a more frightening name than "Paul". I do not care if it's a dreadful hammerhead shark with a mouth full of sharp teeth like daggers and the ability to ambush people in the water and on dry land. Give the child a more dignified name such as "Thor," "Rock," or "Shark." Because even if he eats me, I'll probably stay there laughing, "Ha! Grab a lot of this !!! Monster Paul is making me shred !!!!!" That's the worst part of this movie, this shark thing is known as "Paul" throughout the movie. It makes what could have been a decent and scary horror movie look silly. It's not that there are not other animated and artificial parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists spend the whole film wandering around this island, and suddenly one of the girls begins to sting madly for walking in the lush forest, and only has to pour water on her feet to revive the itching, which of course allows "Paul" Get out of the water and kill her. The only thing SciFI Channel did well in this movie was to let the hottie live. But that's a small positive point in an otherwise disappointing film.
