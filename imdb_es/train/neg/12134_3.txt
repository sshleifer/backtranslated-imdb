At first glance, this should be a great movie, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities and one of the best behind the Hollywood camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why it was Other 8 years earlier, Spacey decided to try to direct a film again. This movie fails on many levels. In a movie where there is not much action and most of the scenes are recorded in a couple of places, it is imperative that the director provide suspense and continuity. Not so much here, the great cast is terribly underutilized, far from the great John Spencer, the plot is so exorbitant and nothing that you have not seen in another hundred movies for television. There is so little development of characters that you end up without worrying about any of the protagonists. At least we know that Spacey has many partners and great influence in Hollywood studios to get away with a bad movie.
