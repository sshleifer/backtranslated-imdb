Imagine the scene in which a group of writers sit around a table and one of them says: "Allow a black woman to approach a member of the public (also black) who does not suspect on the street and ask her if she is black and then move away. " The other writers laugh at the hysterical laughter until one suggests that they repeat it in each episode. More laughs Now, if you think the premise is fun, and the show contains many of these types of situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like looking at the dry painting. Those who have written brilliant reports of this program should go out more or be forced to watch TV comedies that are really fun. Another example of humor in the program, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket and try to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally fun the first time, but why repeat it again and again in different shows with different ATMs? I could give other examples, but these could be treated as spoilers, spreading why this comedy is just not funny.
