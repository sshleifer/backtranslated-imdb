This movie is about what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and sex scenes (quite tame). The film is not sure of what it wants to be and practically ends up being a disaster. It looks more expensive than most director Al Adamson's movies, but it's not at the same level of budget that viewers expect from science fiction movies. The actors are pretty bad and, unlike most Adamson movies, there are no old big names or B actors. Some of the music is fine, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 was forgotten for so many years.
