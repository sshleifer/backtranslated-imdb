This series would have been much better had they done one simple thing: did Ian McShane code name: Diamond Head instead of Code name: Tree. Diamond Head: the character needs someone who can handle the role of the adorable rogue, which McShane showed he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the real Diamond Head, is really so regular on paper. McShane is not really as good as the bad guy Tree. The character of France Nuyen, Tso-Tsing, seems to be unable to decide if she is the unfortunate victim or the woman tough and ready to fight. She really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head's lover. After watching an episode or two, I ended up not caring what would happen to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate it, but Diamond Head does not give us anything we like. Unfortunately, the genre of spies in the 1970s was not as it was in the 1960s.
