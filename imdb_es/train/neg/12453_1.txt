I had always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when Sci-Fi Channel published this movie, I had to see it. I was disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only. He does not wear the right suit [he must have rejected or ordered major changes] and the plot is like that of James Bond of a poor man. There is none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success, that is, superhuman strength or determined will. It's just a long bad dream. I do not even think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I would not waste your time on this.
