My God, what were you thinking? Here is your spoiler warning, although I do not think it really matters. Anyway, you will not see this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> A group of machine guns chase a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid quest to try to kill them, and the puppets complicate things by allowing them to live out their really stupid fantasies. In other words, all this is really stupid. <br /> <br /> YOU KNOW that it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots can not save something !! And they did not! I know, some of their lines were fun, like what to add to the "HIT" sign and the comments of the hand, but, heavens, this was very sad. <br /> <br /> All I can say is DO NOT DO IT. SEE THIS PIECE OR CRUDE. DO NOT WATCH YOUR EYES.
