When I found out how fun this movie is, I finally rented it from the video store <br /> <br /> and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times. This movie <br /> <br />, a collection of parodies that make fun of television is an incoherent mess <br /> <br />. The jokes do not make sense, the humor deals with <br /> <br /> themes from the 1970s that are no longer relevant, and <br /> <br /> the jokes are too long (almost like the new SNL skits the <br /> <br /> last years). Yes, Chevy Chase is in this, but maybe of all <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was very obscene and I had nudity in abundance, but could not it be fun? Do yourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie, which is a film far superior to that of <br /> <br />.
