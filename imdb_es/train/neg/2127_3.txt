Why? Because for one reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any movie than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" in the opening. She repeats it at the end, too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful Rent and see. Even if that's all you see. You will agree, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so excellent that I did not need a new version, I'm sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave excellent performances, as did Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version gave their "everything", but it's like trying to improve in "Casablanca", it just can not be done! It is even annoying to find yourself comparing the two mentally when you try to appreciate the remake, and it falls short, without it being the fault of the actors.
