The rookie suffers from so much. There are the random musical songs interspersed throughout the film, the long, meaningless script and enough slapstick to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt simply do not know when to quit. It takes a full hour before the story finally reaches the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. Then the boys start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid and stereotyped Japanese guys. But, it becomes quite exhausting after switching between two sets of characters. Then it ends abruptly ends. Even a Julie Newmar naked in a towel can not save this. <br /> <br /> There is really little charm in the movie and it lasts more than half an hour. The story simply fails along trying to create funny situations and fail. Stay with Martin and Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face.
