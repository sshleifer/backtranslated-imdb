The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; Redford's movie is mediocrity. Add banal scenes of the Maclean brothers who pass through a waterfall and two of them in a bar of death that did not even hint at the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, who tries to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, an outdoor genius, proves to be laughable or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. In addition, Tom Skerritt as father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were expected to be. None of the women impress in the film, which is unfortunate, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made it clear, even poetic.
