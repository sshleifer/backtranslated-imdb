I'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and be on Maltin's side in this case. This is a second-rate, overly cruel Western who cries and groans as he tries to highlight his central theme: the Wild West is being domesticated and rejected by the constant march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid," but he lacks the emotion and charm of that movie. The direction of Andrew McLaglen is loose, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real obstacle, with an incomprehensible strategy on the part of the heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone screams at me if you can explain why they set the hillside on fire). There was something cruel about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction after that certainly did not sound true. Coburn is quite unpleasant since the mestizo escaped convicted of revenge, but all his escaped comrades are underdeveloped (they are like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story progresses). Michael Parks gives one of his typical performances, lethargic and murmurs, but in this case it was appropriate since his modern sheriff style symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can achieve.
