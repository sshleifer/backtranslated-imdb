Horrible. This thriller should have buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible to write, the characters are less credible. Horrible Schlock !! Stick some B stars in a terribly written TPV to try to give it some credit, but it fails miserably. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given it a word review, start with 'sh' and end with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Horrible end, delayed. Who writes this shit. The end of this film is so artificial, weak, as if they had no idea what to do with this story, or simply ran out of money. Probably due to the amount of cameos in this movie. It's good that these actors are dating, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for them that almost nobody will see it. At least nobody important, as future investors. It could have ended in a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated by my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this, you'll feel like you've wasted your time and you'll never be able to get it. behind.
