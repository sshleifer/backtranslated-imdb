I got this DVD more than 2 years ago and I just decided to see it yesterday. I do not know why it took me as much time as the Inspector Gadget program and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a palette of bright colors and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated film, some ancient things are missing that torment this gadget directly on the toilet. <br /> <br /> First, the classic theme of Inspector Gadget. Song and music are completely absent. The composer tries to commit himself by making a score that sounds similar, but is still not good enough. The gadget mobile device is now a talking car, not a car that can become a van. In addition, it looks much more cute and round instead of just being great. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain barely make an appearance. <br /> <br /> The argument does not exist. There's something about a transformation formula and the use of Doctor Claw for an evil never revealed, but that's all I have. What was the deal with the short / giant Italian guy that I'll never know. It has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something to go through, your last case is not resolved in any way. And he stays in force, so why is it called 'last case' is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> It did not impress me at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent from a DVD, but do not let that take you to buy any Inspector Gadget DVD you can. I sold this a few seconds after finally seeing it. No child will like or appreciate this, and no fan of the old show will tolerate it.
