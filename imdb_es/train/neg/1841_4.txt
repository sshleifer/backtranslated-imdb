This could be seen in many different ways. This movie sucks, it's good or just weird. The third probably explains this movie better. It has strange themes and only has a strange plot. So who else than Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be? <br /> <br /> The performance was what would be expected especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black always liked me, so you know what you'll get from him, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always out of the wall. It's always nice to see it, no matter how bad the movie is. As for comedy, it's kind of funny. This, of course, means that it has its moments (although very few), but it can be a little exaggerated here and there, which makes me feel that the film is desperate to laugh but, of course, not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The address was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here. This movie seemed to have much more potential and did not do much to achieve it. Simply very normal and it does not seem that much effort has been put into making this film. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means that the writing here failed. In the best case it is lower than the average. Considering he has his moments, it was not too horrible. However, that's never good to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Christopher Walken and his stupid ridiculous ending, I would have given him a lower rating. He is always a character in his films. Still, this is just a strange movie with strange characters that really do not go anywhere. It's not all that horrible, but I really would not recommend it because it's a very forgettable movie.
