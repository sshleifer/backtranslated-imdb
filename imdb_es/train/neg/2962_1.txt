Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. You can also the Whoopi Goldberg movies. But Whoopi AND dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to a conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, vile, evil and reprehensible in his sorrow by the public. Nothing so bad is done by accident; This is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not make good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers do not. It does not matter, it's a tough police here once more. <br /> <br /> Have you seen a million movies from police friends this week? Well, here's number one and one, friend. <br /> <br /> Do not you like animated, friendly and humanistic dinosaurs from the Spielberg TV show about them? What's wrong, here is another and he is also a policeman! <br /> <br /> You're one of those people who hates car chases, shootouts, careless dialogue, boring futuristic effects and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller- Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a cancellation of taxes? A GREAT amortization of taxes? <br /> <br /> And read this review to the end. You deserve a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really make a sequel to "Theodore Rex," Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole herd of clever foam rubber dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now, I would pay for that.
