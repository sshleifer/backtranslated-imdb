A cheap science fiction thriller, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from outer space is in charge of ONE MAN, and is VERY poorly protected at night), and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances. (* 1/2)
