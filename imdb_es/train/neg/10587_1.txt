It seems that there is an overwhelming response to this film, but nobody with the vision to criticize its methodology, which is extremely flawed. It simply continues to spread the analysis of the journalistic style, that is, it plays with the ignorance and prejudice of the audience to evoke an emotional condemnation and an explosion of negative diatribe. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the spectator some facts only to predispose them to draw conclusions that are predictable. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc. they were supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of the government infrastructure after Hussein's disappearance: were not they all symptoms of a culture already destitute? doctrinal infighting as a symptom of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in the police force to slow down and secure? Would you prefer that the United States had declared the Marshall law? I am sure that the documents here would have exploded with accusations of a police state and a fascist force. <br /> <br /> Aside from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest claiming "maybe they refused to be interviewed ..." however, the questions they would have asked were already undoubtedly answered by the hundred inquisitions that those individuals have already received. Would you, as vice president, deign to be interviewed by a writer / producer for the first time who was no doubt already prepared to twist your words? they could not shoot Condi's tape to show their opinion and answer part of the logistics of the questions, maybe they never saw her listen. <br /> <br /> This is far from being a neutral view of the situation on the ground there This is another biased and simple approach of journalists, who are, in general, thoughtless herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to comment on the war should at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage. and the CNN comment. These interpretations are of the same vitriol that simply creates an additional bipartisanship of those who want to think and of the media that want the media to tell them what to think.
