Antonioni's films have not aged well. What always surprised me about them is that, in addition to an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "evil capitalist" who wants to sing it in "La notte", or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants who flirt on the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink . At the end of the same movie. <br /> <br /> I have reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are many beautiful and elaborate photos of Rod Taylor's office, the streets and highways of Los Angeles, advertisements, deserts, etc., which show the author's fascination in his trip to the United States, at the same time . Way that Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are many hippie-left clich√©s that ruin the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something different". - Executives in gray suites talk all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the "women object" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - The fat middle class couple in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of nature, to build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples making love in the desert. What a hippie dish! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "The Adventure", we can see that the king is naked, and his movies (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il grido" ) are just a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces.
