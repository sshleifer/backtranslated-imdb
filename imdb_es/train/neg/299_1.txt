This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENTICE After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked and it was a better movie <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan, who unfortunately failed in his attempt here <br /> <br /> the story was good, but the handling was not so good and the heroine was too regressive and the climax was also disappointing <br /> < The direction is bad The music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi resumes his role as YAARANA (strangely, it was also a SWTE remake) and he seems too fat for the leadership and he's fine. Juhi is decent, while Arbaaz tries too hard on his debut and manages many scenes to calm the audience, but his voice was terrible. Johny is too tall.
