'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. Each festival has a disappointment and this is the one that is not up to its very widespread logline: "Thai lesbians fighting monsters." Rather, this is the story of a Khmer girl whose grandmother has taught her a bit of witchcraft along with some strange (but specific) rules: "do not walk under a clothesline", "do not eat raw meat" and "Do not accept money for your powers. " Well, guess what people, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a "bar girl" and manages to break all the rules that the grandmother taught her, which then releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills "foreigners" who pay for it. services. <br /> <br /> While this film can not even be released in Thailand because of its controversial subject, most American audiences will find this image of boring horror between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the vampire" as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If it were not for some scenes with significant amounts of blood, the MPAA could probably rate this only for pre-teens. Literally, there are adult television rates, although at least one sex scene is expected considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. <br /> <br /> As for the 'lesbian' angle, there is a brief slap and a couple of 'I love you' to show that the two main stars are really a couple (as for their brother). And the P-bar has to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs and perform carnival tricks (there is a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic images). <br /> <br /> NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you count on a Thai spirit of five feet tall with yellow eyes), and in no way an ADULT should pay to see this kind of stupidity, except in a DVD. You have been warned!
