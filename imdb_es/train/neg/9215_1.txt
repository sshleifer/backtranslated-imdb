Check the spoiler alert just in case. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I've ever seen, Mazes and Monsters, I felt like I lost 101 minutes of my life. The only redeeming quality of the film were the scenes that tried to be serious, but ended up being funny because they were so bad. Evil Dead someone? Unfortunately for M & M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult and resulted in a trilogy. This film tried to tackle a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film. It ended up being a video of curiosities about the stereotypes that helped to promote the D & D, it is the movement of the devil in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, stay away from this garbage. <Br /> <br /> PS - Even though the cover looks pretty interesting, so I guess my brother bought it, in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider that New England or the New York City are such a place.
