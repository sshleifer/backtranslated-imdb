Last night I saw this movie and I expected the best after seeing all the great trailers. Even the cover of the DVD looked good. As soon as I started seeing her, I was thinking like the others "oh my God, what is this?" moments that were a bit creepy, but then the atmosphere was ruined by the stupid music. There was rock and opera during what are supposed to be suspenseful scenes. That ruined it for me and I shook my head thinking that I lost the money again a rent and was tricked by the art of the cover. Nothing against the music itself, was in the wrong parts of the movie. Who edited the movie has no idea what he is doing. The cover showed lightning, which implies that they were caught in a storm at sea. That would have been more interesting but it did not happen. The performance was not the worst I've seen, since everyone is unknown and this is obvious in his first film. Another reason I was disappointed was that the plot did not make sense. At first, two men saw all the teenagers put in a boat, then in the end there was supposedly only one girl and the others were their imaginary friends or they were ghosts, I'm not sure because I was very badly portrayed. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, states that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is an enchanted ship in the area where this movie was filmed. It was not mentioned in this film that it is a true story. . I have never experienced something like that personally, but I am not saying it is impossible. I suppose if someone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like horror movies of amateur students, you may like this.
