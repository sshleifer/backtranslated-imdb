"When a small Bavarian town is plagued by a series of mysterious deaths, the locale (magistrate) demands answers in (sic) to the attacks, while the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about the return of the vampires to the village, the local doctor is treating the victims begin to suspect the truth about the crimes, "according to the synopsis of the sleeve of the DVD. <br /> <br /> An improperly titled vampire mystery, dramatically unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the second level of the film easily surpasses the mediocre stars of the film: the stoic Lionel Atwill (as Otto von Niemann), the skeptic Melvyn Douglas (as Karl Brettschneider) and the pretty Fay Wray (as Ruth Bertin). The much nicer support cast includes Dwight Frye (like Herman), the hypochondriac, the hypochondriac Maude Eburne (like Aunt Gussie Schnappmann), and the suspect George E. Stone (like Kringen). Mr. Frye, Mrs. Eburne and Mr. Stone excel admirably. Is there another movie that ends with a crazy race to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Magnesium sulfate ?? Epsom salts ?? It is a laxative! <br /> <br /> **** The Vampire Bat (1933) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye, Melvyn Douglas, Maude Eburne
