Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a small success with his script for this comic vehicle for Henry Winkler, then "The Fonz". A university actor from the 1950s (and an imbecile) harasses a co-ed and marries without job prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he resorts to the extravagant world of wrestling, and eventually becomes a celebrity like "Gorgeous George." Turning the sympathetic Winkler into nasty nonsense probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his alter ego from television), but jokes and situations are often malicious and malicious. By director Carl Reiner. Particularly crude is a bit shocking that involves Herv√© Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") putting the movements in Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). Like Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a little out of place, especially when surrounded by all these TV hams, which makes the script's romantic look inconsequential. * 1/2 of ****
