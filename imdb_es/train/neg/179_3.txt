Return to Cabin by the Lake alone ... missing. It must have had a very low budget because a good amount of the film must have been filmed with a normal video camera. Then, within the same scene, you will have some film-quality camera shots and simple video camera shots. It's a very strange mixture! I think they should have found SOME way to not make the "home video" type effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL ... you will never want to see it if you see it first! You will probably find it too corny and will divert you from worrying about the original.
