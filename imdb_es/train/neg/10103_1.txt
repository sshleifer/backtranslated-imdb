This movie made me go. The title was perhaps the best idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about an outbreak of zombies and their quest to take over the United States and a group of lonely survivors, joining and planning to take out the zombies. COMPLETELY WRONG! It is about a psychopath with a weakness for killing his female arrests realizes what happens to him when a group of zombie women gets up from their graves to get the right revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or the county involved. Where to start with the gravity that this cinematic disaster caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First, zombie women look like Victoria's Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies, but smart, intelligent and debatable cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their more basic primitive needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and catwalk models, they talk like they're in a poor black movie and do not act like real zombies. Surely you have to eat and kill, but where is the lack of mind and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire in the zombie genre, it mocks this genre and raises the question: "why can not zombies be beautiful? I would say that this movie would be considered an indie movie really bad that was produced and made by garage junkies.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves too much zombie genres, it's an insult and as far as fear, not even.
