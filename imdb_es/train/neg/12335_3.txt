Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that kind of actors that I'm always interested in seeing, despite the criticism. I have always found that Ms. Ryan is a charming and attractive actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" in large part because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a nice character, she plays a person with little will that starts to irritate your nerves shortly after the initial credits and does not give up until several days later . That said, the character of Kevin Kline is even more annoying and less sympathetic. So, even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend that you give a pass to this movie.
