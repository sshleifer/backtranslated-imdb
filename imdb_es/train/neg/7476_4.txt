Evil Aliens has a great debt to the first films of Peter Jacksons, Bad Taste and Braindead. I must confess that I have never enjoyed those particular movies and the same thing. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration and decides to steal those he looks at. I lost count of the number of times that was cited to a major Hollywood movie, especially James Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and blood shown here is also not funny, the end of the film tires. and dragged. Maybe it would have worked better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director was trying to do, the tribute I was trying to pay, but others have done the same thing much better than the one presented here. 4/10
