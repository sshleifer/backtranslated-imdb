- The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Without the knowledge of the locals, a dinosaur egg is also found at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the hatches of eggs that release a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> - What is absolute garbage. It's not that I care about the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's everything else about the movie that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. Comic relief is anything but comical. The logic does not exist. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this film and a real scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on forever in the negative aspects of this movie, but you understand the idea. I think it's pretty safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
