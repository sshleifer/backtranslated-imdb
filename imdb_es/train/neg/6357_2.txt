I'm very disappointed. This movie left me feeling skipped from my time and mental energy. This was Woody Allen's quintessential film, once again: the upper-class Manhattan neurotics debating whether to cheat on their wives or not. Woody, I've seen these characters, I've seen your story ten times already. Where did your creativity go? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall, and you need to change it. <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and fun scenarios to which you can apply your brand of anguish and neuroticism. Why not try them? instead of repeating the same old mistake over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, he does not do anything for me, because now I've come to wait. his old way of waiting: the couple that is getting tired of each other and ends up cheating. Depressing and just as old, as always. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to get his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence should be stimulated, not insulted.
