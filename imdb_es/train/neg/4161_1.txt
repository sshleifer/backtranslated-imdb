A ragged plot, uninteresting characters and a sub-par dialogue (to say the least) plague this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a production budget of one billion dollars. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible, In their motives, actions or occupations professed. The plot reads like a bad hack of Dungeons and Dragons (TM) but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious problems of continuity and the degree of useless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, making a face. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will have better performance, dialogue and plot. Yuk
