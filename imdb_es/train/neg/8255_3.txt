At least it is not full of senseless violence or fluff. Neither is it too full of thought or a smooth story. This story had some potential, but the director seems to have lost the green site. The story is disjointed and begins in strange directions <br /> <br />, without conclusion. Nor do I think the director spent a lot of time around a golf club. Some of the representations are absurd. It is not very attractive.
