I was excited to hear that César Montano had decided to make a film in the Cebuano language. (No 'dialect', as most Filipinos will incorrectly call it "like Cebuano and Tagalog are as unintelligible to each other as French and Spanish are). But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. Being Canadian, of Cebuano parents, I felt optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was more excited to hear that it was not another action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love this type of movie. But, unfortunately, I had a small change. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for César Montano. Montano, of course, plays the hero of the movie. And when I say "hero" I mean the most stereotyped manners; its function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bolones to victory against the Japanese. Your character has no depth or complexity. It just fits into the mold of the hero. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; they all fit into their roles as cookie cutters. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of meditative or slow moving movies, but this movie was only slow. I really did not meditate on anything. Just because a film has a historical theme, a drama and a slow movement do not make it a well-made film. <br /> <br /> Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was shameful. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he should have thought about it. He said he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc., but in reality, this movie would have been booed and whistled at such festivals. In order to make Visayan films generally aware, he should have made at least one film that would have attracted the public, even if that meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he did not think or get information about what kind of films won awards at Cannes, so a movie that attracts the audience would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid now Visayan movies will not be done again for a long time because of this movie. If I ever told a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan films, of course, I would get an answer like: "The Visayans do not make good movies, did not they see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, this is ridiculous, as it is an example of a Visayan film and probably the only example that anyone can see today. <br /> <br /> An example of films that are meditative, not just slow moving, are The Tagalog Blackout movie or The Straight Story by David Lynch. I hate to promote the Tagalog language, since it is promoted inexhaustibly and unjustifiably and the throats of the Filipinos are not Tagalog, but for the sake of calling a pica a spade, I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie. These films are based largely on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Images without words are used to convey the story. But I double the definition a bit for the sake of these two films, since these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take pictures of the landscape, then they have established the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies with a dying mother or grandmother?
