I am not one of those people who simply connect online after watching a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please see my other comments. However, for the first time, I have seen a film so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was over. <br /> <br /> I LOVE bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought that Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and most of the horrible horror movies were good. However, there is nothing good that I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically nonexistent. If someone who reads my review wastes his money to see it, he can discern for himself what the plot might be, but I advise him that a penny would be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two tracks are attractive, but that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I INVITE anyone to send me an email to foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion about this movie before spending a penny on it. she. I'll tell you anything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, and I love horror and I like new creative movies. I even love the horror porn stuff like the hostel (as some critics said it was, but obviously they only thought about it because Roger Bart was in this and the Hostel 2) But this may be the most useless, stupid number 1 movie and stupid that has been done. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this review, it comes from someone who not only participated in ALL the premiere of House of the Dead, but actually I bought a copy of it.
