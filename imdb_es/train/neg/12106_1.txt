A cowardly, cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows Cahill stealing wealthy houses, but it shows that the male occupant is unfaithful to the babysitter, that's fine. The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is puffed up in his car, but he's a rat-faced sourpuss, and he does not look like a good man, so that's fine too. The Beits, owners of Russborrough House, earned their money by exploiting the "dark ones" that unearthed diamonds, so it's okay to steal some priceless art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Garda kill their ferrets and are implicated in their murder. The moral equivalence is disgusting, Boorman looks for a hit movie, but does not have the guts to oppose the criminality of the generals gang, which terrorized the neighborhood, and unleashed another wave of trash in Dublin. He even contacted the son of the generals while he was doing it. Disgusting. Pity about him for his cowardice.
