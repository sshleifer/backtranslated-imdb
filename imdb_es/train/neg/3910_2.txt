Isabel Allende's lyrical and magical novel about three generations of a South American aristocratic family was shattered. The large number of films that resulted, in large part due to a magnificent cast of Anglo-Saxon actors completely incapable of carrying the evasive Latin mellifluity of Allende's characters, and a laborious Scandinavian director's hand, was so uncomfortable on his own skin that I returned for the second time to the theater to make sure that I had not missed something vital that could change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed anything. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave were able to get rid of the trap set by director Bille August. They all looked perfectly rigid and resigned, as if, by trying as little as possible, they expected to go unnoticed to a series of enchanting times. (Yes, the movie was directed by art an inch from his life). Curious that the production designer was allowed to place the KFC products in a prominent place in a scene that occurred around 1970, years before KFC was created. Back then, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving that, what the hell is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? The American fast food chains did not affect South America until the early eighties. "The House of the Spirits" should have been the film event of 1993. Because he was so faithful and true to his vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have filed charges of rape.
