The angels who had a bit of disgust were expelled from heaven and now reside in a British forest where they seduce and cut off teenagers. Talk about high concept. On the positive side, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but as her performance range is limited to two minutes of screen time, her presence of five minutes seems a bit long. The angels run naked through the woods for most of the movie, but although they may have the body of an angel, their faces look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. The mediocre performance and the gore amateur effects do not help and the night scenes inevitably recall the most famous movie of Paris Hilton. So bad that it is REALLY bad.
