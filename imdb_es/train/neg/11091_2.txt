Denzel is the only thing that is good in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe once at an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut back some action and draw points at the beginning of the film, giving away most of the story in the first 5 minutes. That and ruin any accumulation of rhythm and rhythm that the movie has had before. <br /> <br /> So first you get confused and then you get discouraged. Dramatization pushes beyond the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that films like this can instill in the viewers. Of course, he does it so if you're looking for that ... take a look.
