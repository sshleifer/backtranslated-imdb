I can barely find the words to express how utterly horrible this film is. They sold me with the promise of action, with Segal and stealth planes, which usually make an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say that I prefer to take my eyes off with a cocktail than having to watch this movie again. The performance was so horrible that it was almost funny. The story was incredibly weak, with holes in the plot so cavernous that you could fly an F117 through them. The script was very poor, if I discovered that a 10-year-old child wrote it, it should not surprise me in the least. The management and production are so amateur, I would not even hire these people to record the wedding video of my worst enemies. Completely absolute drivo. Those responsible for making this film have cheapened the art and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never again show his face in public, I can not imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
