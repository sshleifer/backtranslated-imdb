Basing a television series on the works of a popular author is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned this in the most difficult way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were issued under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, an ex-jockey who became private after an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to be replaced by an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and seemed one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's ass when it was on the screen. For six weeks, this less than dynamic duo charged the field, frustrating infamous plots to fix races, usually with the same methods: blackmail, kidnapping of riders or doping. Yorkshire Television threw money into the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, implausible and repetitive, was quickly taken to the yard of the destroyers.
