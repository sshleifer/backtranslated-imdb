I have given this program (I have only seen seven episodes) four stars because most of its jokes / settings seem to fail. Some are not funny at all, but others are fun, in a way, like a 12-year-old child. It reminds me of the New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman pulls what she has, including the kitchen sink, while praying that some things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different. <br /> <br /> However, what you "have" is often not enough, as if it lacked the kind of follow-up that a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole company is like a poorly made potato.
