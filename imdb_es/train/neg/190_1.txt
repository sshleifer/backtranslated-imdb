I always felt that a good movie should have an argument. This particular movie was missing one, and I think it would have been more effective with an argument. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to last forever; I was anxious that it would finally end. However, I realized that it only lasted 123 minutes; It felt like four hours. Not only was there no argument, but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious." So, do not think that this revision of mine is of someone who does not need more than action. Actually I hate most action movies nowadays; it's just that this movie is on the other side of the spectrum. There really is not much happening in this movie. However, the scenery and the costumes were beautiful.
