It was difficult to see this film and be totally fair and objective, since I am a big fan of the original film of 1944. That, for me and for many others, is one of the best film noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a reduced movie for television and that most people had destroyed it, I did not expect much, but you can not avoid comparing this with the movie of '44. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was seeing, and remembering how it worked with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was watching these famous actors performing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I discovered that it was not as bad as I expected. But it is not a rival to the original of 1944. The two main areas in which this film made for television was not so good were (1) electricity was missing between the two derivations and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the history almost no time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry among those leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply were no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson," respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this new version remained in the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also interesting to see that the time frame changed, so that houses, cars, telephones, dictation machines, etc., were all from the early 70s instead of the mid 40s. Otherwise , the story was very similar, just hurried. <br /> <br /> However, one view was enough and I will gladly go back to the original version for the rest of my presentations of this classic story and movie.
