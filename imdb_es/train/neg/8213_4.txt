I can not believe it, IMDb really has all the television shows known to man! I have not seen this show in more than 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I barely remember them. I remember that Tony may not have been on since the beginning, because one of the episodes that I remember is that everyone who tried to join Tony, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the program he becomes a member of Power House, with everyone cheering. <br /> <br /> The other one I remember is the one in which Lolo, for some reason, pretends to be dead (complete with the funeral and the mourners). I do not remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows in which I convinced myself that I had dreamed since no one else had heard of him.
