Amelia and Michael are a married couple who are cheating. Amelia has a lover in the hospital for a long time and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two burn with their infidelity, but manage to connect with each other at the end. <br /> <br /> There is not much of this particular short. The direction is direct and dramatic, which is good, the performance is sincere, but the story leaves a little to be desired. Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It is a bit difficult to see how this story stands out from any other story of infidelity, except that it is much smaller and does not look for any meaning in it (a welcome change of pace in any case). <br /> <br /> I do not know, I may not connect to these stories because I've never experienced them. But I've noticed that the blockage in these narratives is usually the same, that is, a couple converses while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. The good thing about short films is that they provide a bit more space. for trying something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
