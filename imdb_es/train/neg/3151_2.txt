"It had to be You" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer turned Author. When Charlie's fianc√© leaves the city, he gets stuck with all the planning of the wedding. He spends a week in a luxurious hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who is also getting married. The two quickly became friends and prepared to plan their weddings separately. This is when the plot becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie starts every romantic comedy that has been made and makes you wait for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge offer really mediocre performances, which makes this movie even more difficult to watch.
