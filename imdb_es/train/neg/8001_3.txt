MONSTER: it was great; I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon". SOCIAL COMMENTS: much of the story takes place in the quarantine area like doctors (under government orders). State that the disease similar to SARS is out there. In short, we have the history of concealment of family government. You know, I hope that this liberal paranoid mentality with Hollywood movies will always paint our government as corrupt, but it seems that Koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. Here, it moves away from the emotion and suspense of this "monster". Just drag the movie down. The main family that appears in the film has to watch from a distance, while the creature drags the girl from his family, presumably dead. <br /> <br /> MORAL: a typical "do not pollute water" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster.This used to be the message of the 1950 anti-nuclear bomb, when the radiation caused gigantic ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those sci-fi movies, it's now your "environmental problems" that you focus on. <br /> <br /> THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. slapstick but this was not funny, I do not know if the Korean sense of humor is so unfortunate, or if the film tried to be ultra-intentional with a version of the old "Godzilla" movies, hopefully the latter. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The video transfer was good, this was a sharp-looking image and the sound was decent with a lot of noise from the back of the speaker, I saw it in Korean with the English subtitles, that could have been an error, since the Korean guttural voice became annoying after . S half an hour <br /> <br /> GENERAL - This was a promise but turned out to be a big disappointment and even boring in too many places, which is inexcusable for a monster movie today. Two hours was too long for this story. How this movie attracted record crowds in Korea, I do not know. They should not have much in terms of movies to enjoy and support.
