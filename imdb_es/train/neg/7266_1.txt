... and, however, they told us that another hour and 20 minutes were missing. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why there was not an editor to tell the writer / director to cut, cut snip Apparently that writer / director has done shorts before; In short, this would have been fine. But the lack of dialogue begins to grate after twenty minutes. The lack of much music shines. The background noises (conversations, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) age very quickly. But the worst failure is in history. There is very little beyond a short one. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost shouted on the screen, "We got it, we got it !!!!!" It is amazing that, after that, we left the theater, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, prepare to go to bed and know that the public was STILL trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to please your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
