If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's great. Do not do it The movie itself put me to sleep. It was slow, had a minimum of violence and a misuse of suspense. The performance was background material and the plot, although it would have been great for a different movie, was poor here. They even kill the only sympathetic character in the whole movie! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the turn of the plot at the end. Apart from that, you may want to save yourself from the rubbish of this movie.
