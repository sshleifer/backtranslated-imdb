supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model turned into bounty hunter. I would say that 95% is manufactured. I always have an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its possibilities when it became clear that there was narration throughout the film, something I can not stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so Odious and represented as arrogant because I just wanted him to end up with a shot in the head. It's too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it's a shitty story, and I really think that big-time directors need to make films based on their own imagination or on that of a writer, not on an ignorant life. .
