This sarcastic and homophobic thing was dated in 1976. Now it seems particularly petty, full of homosexual stereotypes and characters with whom you should laugh, instead of with. Redd Foxx makes his standard style, Michael Warren at least tries to take humanity to a one-dimensional character, and Pearl: Pearl, what were you thinking? Pearl Bailey deserves much better.
