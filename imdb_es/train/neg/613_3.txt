Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a louse of shit. I'm surprised that he qualified as high as he did. What's wrong with this movie? Here is a better question: what is NOT wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just shit and clich√©. This is what it is about ... A nerdy child without friends is attacked, killed and returns as a scarecrow to take revenge. "Everything" is packaged in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching it. Also, the second one is not much better, so do not bother to see it either ... I rated this movie with three because I liked the scarecrow's attire, not because there's something good in the movie. I think you have an idea.
