I watched the whole movie until the shameful ending even though I was so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director was asking for attention and the only way I could achieve it was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I live in the UK, I have come to love this country, but this film shows young British people in the worst possible way. There is nothing to say, but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. The people involved must be ashamed.
