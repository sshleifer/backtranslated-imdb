All right! What can you say? First, this adaptation is too long at 4 hours, due to the complexity (or lack of it) of the plot. The actors struggle to make something of this film, but there is very little content for the time available. Swayzee really is not a Quatermain character. After seeing Sean Connery's performance of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Knights," Swayzee really does not score. This guy with the Winchester replay rifle does not have the strength, the stature, the subtlety or the humor needed for the role, and everyone has it, including the witch doctor, who, by the way, seems to be more convincing as an actor than from my point of view. The rest of the deal. Some of the views are nice, but there are silly mistakes in cinematography. For example. When the happy team reaches the waterhole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible to the oasis, waiting to be walked on. Leaving the mine leads to an exit (in the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage through which they climbed, and so on. I was waiting for Doug McClure to show up at any moment. Somehow I wish he had done it. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who persecute Quatermain is a stereotyped character of poor quality who just shot everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee does it quite well as the sad father, returned to London, who can not get custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that kind of thing. He is not able to assume the role of a courageous knight with a robust heart, life experience and sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Just
