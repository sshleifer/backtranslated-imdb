I have seen Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in the United States. Considering that this movie was made for television, it was interesting enough to see the sequel. So, I tune in to the broadcast tonight and I was very disappointed. I knew I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable if it were not for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be linked to these shots, but there did not seem to be a logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CAN BE A SPOILER !!) The open end in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending in the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee that the Returning Return to La Caba√±a by the Lake can be seen if the movie was against anything, but the infomercials at 4 in the morning.
