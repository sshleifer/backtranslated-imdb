Townies is the most lazy movie I've seen, and I watched the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). He seems confused in what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror and it's not good enough to see it. It has scenes of a man doing "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think, oh, this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it jumps without warning in a drama about a missing girl, a retarded woman (with mental disability) and a confident mother. Then he gets into the ONLY good part of the movie that seems to be set up as a comedy without the laugh songs. The part of which I am speaking is a solitary TOWNIE that is so alone that it finds comfort in a rotten corpse. That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is, there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's movie (the Director) taunting Toby (the star) in public. I got sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne movies) are not the best, at least they are thought enough so you can keep yourself entertained until the end credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, he had some great lines that I still use today. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like surface films, and if you like to see your feet, just resting where they are, you will not like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br />
