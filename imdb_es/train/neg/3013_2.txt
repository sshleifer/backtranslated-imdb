Beginning with its long opening of seemingly endless lines of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. His monumental narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there is never a connection between the current Asian impulse of industrialization and wealth and the previous experiences of hunger and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an effort to present Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". Much of the film is a slideshow of these images. They are well produced, are the size of a museum and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost any photograph can look beautiful if it is presented well. Industrial waste remains industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the spoken message of the film remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that there are no real problems and, sometimes, desperate when countries rush to industrialize. Manufactured landscapes, however, offer only a strange and bitter despair. It's like a two-hour conference by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
