Well, I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go see most of the things, now that the multiplex cinemas are very good (I remember the old single-screen cinemas "flea" and I'm the healthy side of 40). In England this film was released as "Liar", it is a dog. It is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 only for photography and set.
