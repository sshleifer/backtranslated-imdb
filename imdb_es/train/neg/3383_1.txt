The first time I saw the live musical at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts was absolutely amazing, awesome and had a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked a lot more than most of the musicals I've seen in the stage. The interesting thing is that you could NEVER see Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of the entire production. When I found out they were making a movie, I waited with great expectation, but when I saw the film version I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. The film lacks a captivating atmosphere in live production and never allows you to be completely in touch with all the characters. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and, if it were ever revived, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you do everything possible to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
