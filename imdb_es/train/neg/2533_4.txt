I agree with most, if not all, of Tom's previous commentator (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great study of characters combined with a great fight with swords and emotion. <br /> <br /> I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I think 14 has not been released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated and seemed to be a mix of many previous Zatoichi story lines. At one point, I was wondering if I was not watching a remake of a previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing because it began to depend on the effects (a rolling head, cut limbs, blood) and Less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films were successful based on history and action, and gained a large following without having to resort to the effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films DO NOT follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi movies, and I recommend them.
