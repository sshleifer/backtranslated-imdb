This is the only movie I've ever been on. bad acting, bad plot, bad distribution, bad direction, bad cinematography, if they had proposed to make a bad image, they could not have done a better job. I hope you are proud of your turkey. I'm surprised that someone related to this movie has been hired again in Hollywood. do not waste your time
