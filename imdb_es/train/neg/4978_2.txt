['This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was as if someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim, &quot;I LIKE!&quot; <br /><br /> I saw this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV show &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie, unlike any of his costars. They stayed in all kinds of speeches from Old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /><br /> There are already many comments on how this film is different from the source material. However, even on its own, the plot of this movie is not good. It is simply boring, what even the low budget does not justify. Having a low budget means you need at least to have a good story, a dialogue and a decent performance. Those things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on CGI half and in some decent suits and ensembles. <br /><br /> Life is too short to see this movie.']
