I saw this movie a couple of years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing on. So I spied it. What really bothers me is that it does not make sense and that's why it's disturbing. Richard stays tied with chicken wire and Jarvis begins to kiss with the girl of Richard while he is unconscious. Then, Jarvis' friend, Troubador, is playing a stupid song on his guitar. The next morning, he shows Richard's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby, and then she goes back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied. Then they play happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? They broke? And what was he saying to those 2 guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is disconcerting and poor. I can not stand movies that are annoying and do not make sense. This was the worst movie I've seen since the 90s version of The Lord of the Flies.
