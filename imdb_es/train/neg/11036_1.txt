It must be the most amazing television program in the air. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent that the younger brother. I hope that this program is canceled and never be spoken again, except in a negative use. Jim has to retire or something like that. Please, let them go on air. If I come to a joke about that program, I'll puke and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I prefer to be taken from the same devil than to watch half an hour complete that piece of programming. I still do not understand why the show is still up and running. Deep down, we all know we want to film our television screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
