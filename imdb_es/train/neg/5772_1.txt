I just have to add, in case someone actually reads this and has not fully grasped the point yet. These other critics are not kidding, this is the worst color movie you'll probably see. When the movie started, I could not believe that something like this really was for the world to see. <br /> <br /> They do not just say it when they say it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the "director" took the hi8 family camcorder (before the DV cameras and non-linear computer editing), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.) took some decent-looking acting students and He went out to film a movie. Without a script, I only invented it as it went on. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one audio channel (to the left of the right speaker). At first I thought I had connected badly. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes. I got up and went to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but then I could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound in different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad that they're good, something like that. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit that I'm a budding filmmaker. And watching bad movies just makes you want to go out and PROVE that you can do better, you know? But seeing this only made me feel sorry for who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the girl was hot and I was disappointed at the brevity of the bathroom scene. A little T and A of her would have raised the score of nothing to maybe a 3 or a 4. But, unfortunately, no. If you want to make a movie but it's fucking shit, throw some free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
