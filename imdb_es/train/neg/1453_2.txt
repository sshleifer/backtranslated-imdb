I'm not sure it was the language or the bad performance, but everything about this movie looks and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, this is a big disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people could make a mess of something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Either in English or in the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
