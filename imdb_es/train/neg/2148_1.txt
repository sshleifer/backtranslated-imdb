Possible spoilers, maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First, the film was made during the rise of the Disney sequel. It was created almost at the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which hurt its original film classics. (Disney also did "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I'm going to put that theme aside because his original films were never really classic in the first place. ") Let me go ahead and say that I'm an avid supporter of the good Disney movies, and I adore Disney's original "Cinderella." The sequel to "Cinderella," however, was a waste of time.The Cinderella character in the sequel was very different from the original girl I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and affectionate, the new Cinderella had moments very out of place with phrases of the current era like, "I'm going to make this banquet my way!" Let me tell you too, the new Cinderella (as I've called her affectionately) says: "Ewww!" That's anti-Cinderella, I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! Why? They did everything to to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are simply and horrible family members for poor Anasta. My question to the world: Did Disney people see the original "Cinderella" when they made this sequel? Well, surely it does not look like it. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am in favor of redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first, Anastasia was evil. In the second, she is good. One simply can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other films, is embarrassing the name of Walt Disney. Maybe now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start to take shape around the Mouse House.
