A star for the "plot". A star for acting. A star for the dubbing in American of shrill voice. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity to take off all their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before she made "Manon des sources". Béart also gets naked a couple of times, but even fully dressed, her presence is enough to make this film eminently visible. Beware of the scene in which she tells her friend the three "first times" for a girl. It's corny, but even more erotic than the "love scenes" choreographed in a cheerful way with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, cinematography is not great; the stills for closing credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of doing.
