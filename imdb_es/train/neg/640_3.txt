An alienated and alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an Army Captain returning from service in World War II with memory problems (now there is an original idea!). He seems to remember the old flame Glenda Jackson but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to cause some emotional sparks. This well-trained groomer brings the protagonist Alan Bates with the director Alan Bridges and his co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but all the burners are at a low level. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' rhythm is a bit slow and the dull color of the film is unnerving. Long on the shelf, this "Soldier" is better left forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
