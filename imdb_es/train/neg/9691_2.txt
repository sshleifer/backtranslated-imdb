This is a superficial hedonism and / or a social comment wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous girl's plan to separate her father and girlfriend. Is it incest or simply a view through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters, except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and vile. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comment of "children with breasts" from a previous review). The plot progressed heavily. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that, unfortunately, lasted for an hour and a half! If you want to see great dresses and jewelry in the Riviera, I recommend "Catch a thief", in which you will get additional bonuses of an entertaining story and nice characters. <br /> <br /> I like that the movies entertain me. I personally do not care where a movie is set. At any time or place, I want a good story: comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a good performance, and so does David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The rating of "2" is only for Kerr and Niven, and for the cinematography: the rich scenes of color and the Dark, presentiments in black and white. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography of the world can not save a poor story with unpleasant characters. The ear of a sow is still the ear of a sow. Consequently, seeing this disaster was a serious waste of my time.
