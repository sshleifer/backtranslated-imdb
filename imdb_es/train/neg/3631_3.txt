It is true that Parsifal is not an opera that can attract everyone, although it is one of my favorites, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg's complete approach is very static. Every time the music starts to suddenly increase ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The shots of Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to the movie edition? The result is physically exhausting to see. The viewer is never transported spiritually. Your impulse is to run home and replay a recording to confirm that Wagner did well, Syberberg did it wrong. And that decoration, set with those "clever" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism, will there ever be a spectator of this film without prior knowledge of Wagner?
