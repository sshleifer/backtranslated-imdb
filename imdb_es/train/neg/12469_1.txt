I rarely give up on a movie without seeing the whole program. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I surrendered. Halfway down, I turned it off with bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie is disjointed, boring, confused and dull. The performance was dry and without credible portraits. The general plot was good, but it developed so insipid and boring that it failed to capture my attention or interest. The multiple subplots often did not connect to each other and seemed more random stories than a real connected plot. Pity that such a serious issue and such great actors could create a failure. I can not imagine that this film receives any nomination, much less a prize.
