It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we end up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact dark thriller that reached the status of "cult", demonstrating the art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film does not add anything, it does not deliver anything and, finally, it ends up in the big box of failed sequels. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and capable cast. Unfortunately, we're treated to a 90-minute dissertation about Catherine Tramell's self-indulgent life ... or it's Sharon Stone. Possibly a copulation of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is too much, see a continuation of the sensual provocation of sex as in "B.S.1", forget it. You end up with the boredom of soft pornography that, in the end, supports the old adage that a woman can be more attractive with clothes than with her. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was rambling in her games, through GEORGY GIRL in 1966, when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and skillful enough to defend herself, even here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie fan, you should watch this movie and judge it with your own rating system. If not, you can wait for the release of the DVD in the "qualified" version, the "unqualified" version, the "collectors" edition or the "final" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with the news of "Basic Instinto 3 ", at which time Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care.
