If you have ever seen this movie, you would know it! If you have not done it and you want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie, as it is classified as the worst. So, if you're really bored, go rent it. If you want to know how it is, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler was hired to work on a giant cruise with some models of Mrs. Universe and five other people. Adam does not like how a passenger is receiving all the babies, and tries to take over the jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You will have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it is.
