The deceitful cover, the title and the very small hidden footprint of Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and attracted me. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of the movie, the movie began to include things that were not ready and that did not make sense. My first thought was: "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up seeing parts of the movie again, thinking that I had missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time I got to the last 1/5 of the movie, everything was ABORTION, ANNOUNCING, RELIGION, DIALOGUE OF INCHES that did not make sense, did not say anything, and it was annoying to hear it; I turned off the sound and made a quick advance to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Beware of DVDs labeled Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I am a practicing Catholic.
