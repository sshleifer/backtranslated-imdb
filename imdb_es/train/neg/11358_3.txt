When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was shown in a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction of the seats moving). I guess the version I saw was an abbreviated version (15 min.) And it was also recreated to add the effects of movement. It was a nice movie ... but that was it. It was educational and talked about the first mission, but the end of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... trite. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I will say that the actors of the characters were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. So, in general, I would say if you want to bring younger children ... do it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
