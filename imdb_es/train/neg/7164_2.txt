This movie is more deceptive than ever, using a suspense actor like Walken to play this piece of scrap made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this. And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about a witch and you do not really see it until almost the end of the movie, but in the meantime you have to sit and watch this boring movie while it's about, or try to get to the meaning. of the point and you have to go through all this way of bored actors and actresses thinking all the time of how you passed another movie and decided on this and how you just lost your money, it just makes the moment useless. there. I prefer to see cartoons for the love of God. Leave this alone, please!
