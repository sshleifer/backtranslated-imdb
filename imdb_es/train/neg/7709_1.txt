Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> Try to be a parody in the science fiction / thriller films of the 50s and 60s, but all that is successful is making you really want you to see one of them and not see it. . <br /> <br /> He's very lame. A parody must have some aspect that has something of superior quality at par. This movie does not have any aspect of this type. <br /> <br /> Beware. It's too late for me, but ... do not look at it.
