I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in the translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie were boring. I have often thought about how interesting it would be to make a movie that only shows a typical day or period that really does not make sense. Now that I've seen a movie like that, I will not think in that way anymore. There are tones about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has that. And when I see South Park, it really moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie with a seven or more because I love each movie. I gave this movie one.
