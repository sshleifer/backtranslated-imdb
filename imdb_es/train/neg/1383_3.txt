Lick, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this film, and the HK weapons hunter genre is one that I do not despise, but I rarely see such a ridiculous and ridiculous story as this one. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in this kind of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action bears the surreality mark and the superior nature of the Hong Kong action, but it is not very engrossing, obscenely bloody and, in fact, often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to the reissue for the US release, shows signs in many patchwork places). I was very disappointed.
