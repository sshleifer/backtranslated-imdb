Dil was a memorable film that brought to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie continued with Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti, all excellent. <br /> <br /> But every successful director gives some horrible movies along with some successes too. Pyare Mohan is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Even though the comedies are very nice, the viewer does not laugh. In comparison to the kind of comedy movies that are being made today, this is nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a movie and laugh, do not see this. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie is worth it.
