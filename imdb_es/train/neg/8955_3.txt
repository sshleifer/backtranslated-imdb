As for the movie, it's a good science fiction movie. It has many great things and some quality scenes. That said, it's not so good, and some of the things are pretty implausible ... <br /> <br /> As for calling this other cube, the movie is absolute and complete. This is the same definition of milking a great original and inventive film ... All the feeling can be translated somehow into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube. it's a bit of a stretch ... <br /> <br /> I gave this a 3 *** because of the stab on the back of the original. This should have remained sterile in so many parts of the film that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> It can be seen for those who have not seen Cube and Hypercube, but it is not recommended fans of the series ...
