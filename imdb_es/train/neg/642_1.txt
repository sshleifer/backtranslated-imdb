First of all, if you're a comic book fan, well, you'll be VERY disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic, now he suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! Producers of chicken, gave him some spicy and guts to the comic (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The striking building N.Y. Winch becomes a medium-small yacht common in H.K. The handsome Largo becomes an unshaven tzigan / Turkish type. Freddy, the pilot 'Scarface' becomes a fat guy, out of shape, sad, normal. Simon, Largo's good friend, does not exist at all! He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, just some snake looks ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious television movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the ability or the technology to properly adapt the comic, please follow a romance filmed in Paris. Very, very bad movie, well, I just rented it, do not count on me to see the sequel (if there is one!).
