I should not even check this movie, since it's not really a horror movie, and therefore it's not worthy of Dr. Cheese's attention. At least, it's not horror in the usual sense. Without a doubt, it is a horrible proposal to waste time watching this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, that is correct; In simple terms, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many flaws, not all of them unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to commit to Christianity on its own terms. It is very possible to make truly spooky films that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, films like this are simply a heterogeneous mix of the imaginations of the filmmakers (usually boring and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made a film apparently about, say, physical, but not only misunderstood the basic laws of physics, but based the whole plot on its misplaced representations, it would soon tire of the resulting useless plot. The same happens with this type of movies. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar films before) invent things from the Catholic Church and from Christian faith and intent. To build a plot based on these inventions. As expected, the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This film has the additional charm of being so interesting to see how toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this smoking stack.
