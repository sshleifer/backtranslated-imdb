It was not the most useless cinematic animation experience in history, but it certainly can not be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, which provides first-person narration), and its journey across the borders of the Old West. Basically, he is born free among all the other horses in the beautiful field, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, manages to get rid of all those who try to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form a friendship, oh, and obviously have something for the Little Creek female. In the end, after some more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and taking a big final leap through a gorge, Little Creek lets the Spirit go, and also frees his female horse, and They run home from their field and horse companions. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected to see horses talking in this movie, but it turns out to be more like a Dumbo thing, and Bryan Adams' songs are not the most attractive, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animation Film, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Song for "Here I Am" by Bryan Adams. Good!
