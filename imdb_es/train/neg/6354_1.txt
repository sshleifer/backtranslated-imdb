Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. This is the case of "Melinda and Melinda", where all the characters talk with the generic pseudo-sophistication of Allen and have problems and points of view that can not be related to anyone outside of a four-block radius where Allen lives. They also share the curious condition of being able to pay for Manhattan's multi-million dollar apartments that seem to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only character that exists outside of this boring mentality is Will Ferrel as a mandatory replacement for Woody Allen. Although not limited to making an impression of Woody Allen (as Kenneth Branagh in the dreadful "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that had the real Woody when he played the role in his best movies. . <br /> <br /> The end result is another of a series of indulgent complacencies by a great filmmaker who has been exchanging his old reputation for years.
