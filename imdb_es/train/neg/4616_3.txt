This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and the clever characterization, acting and direction we've seen with The Sopranos, but I just saw Prizzi's Honor for the first time, only on DVD. <br /> <br /> The experience of looking It should have been very different with an audience of 24 years ago, but I must say that I was horrified at the end. Not only violence, but the mere idea that, in some way, this would be a satisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good surprise, but this seemed so out of place ... Also, when was this movement supposed to be set? All the cars looked like they were from the 1960s, and yet the towers of the World Trade Center (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many scenes of cityscapes. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film has aged badly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel from coast to coast with a knife in his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the audience of the mid-1980s found this movie charming and fun. Mid-eighties, meets the last afternoons: only one of you can live.
