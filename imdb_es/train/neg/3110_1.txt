Normally I enter this website before going to the cinema, since I like to see what others think of the movie. I read many reviews that said 'thriller not a horror movie'. This prompted me to try this movie. I really must disagree with these claims of 'thriller / horror', since it was not any! I almost went and asked him to give me back my money, and if many of the critics enjoyed this crap ... well, they should be happy easily! At the end of the film, the people behind me said out loud "what a waste of time" and I turned to them and said: "I could not have summed it up any better". I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it was not like that. There was the potential for many good threats (or emotions if you wish), but none happened. Williams did quite well, but I felt I had been changed by a bad script that did not work and was not going anywhere. Save your people money, this is a turkey that will be presented in the 'bargain box' of a DVD store near you in the foreseeable future!
