['... Let me count the forms. <br /><br /> 1. A single title remake that takes out all the clich√©s from the Slasher manual. <br /><br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /><br /> 3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or emotion. <br /><br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that does not ensure bleeding, violence or sex. <br /><br /> 5. A villain that is not scary or even mysterious. <br /><br /> 6. A cast of characters that are so well written and stereotyped that we could not possibly care about them. <br /><br /> 7. Lack of a really creepy atmosphere (very different from the original Prom Night). <br /><br /> 8. A script of dialogue that is beyond the poor, is numbing the mind. <br /><br /> 9. A series of performances on cardboard (I&#39;m not sure if to blame the actors or the bad script mentioned above). <br /><br /> 10. A remake of slasher aimed at completely inept teenagers who is not brave enough to try to have an imagination, or even to show a pool of blood. <br /><br /> He is a fan of uncomplicated terror, saves your money. <br /><br /> PUMP OUT OF ****']
