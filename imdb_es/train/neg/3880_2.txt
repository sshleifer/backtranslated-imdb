I can see a good bloody movie once in a while. I have seen some very sick things. However, this is one of the few movies that I found grotesque in a way that was simply repulsive and disgusting. I like gore movies when they are fun. I like it when they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this movie is not creative. This sick person is disgusting. It is completely unpleasant. Because of this, this movie is certainly not entertaining. The movie is a horror movie, but it lacks fear. So more or less the only reason that one could see this movie is by the gore, but that is the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and that is saying a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is really annoying and sounds too electronic. Everything took me out of the movie. Virtually the whole movie is a big depressing test. There is a guy who has a strange accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to discover that his skin is dissolving and melting. I guess after that he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the fusion process. There is a strange argument that involves an elderly couple being chased by a dog, a dismembered head floating in a stream and an ending involving an electrocuted man. There were times when I tried very hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was even entertaining was the scene in which a nurse runs down a corridor of the hospital in slow motion. If you like ugly, unpleasant and unattractive horror films, this is for you.
