I just saw the movie in the theater. The movie has very few positive points to talk about. The beauty of Kareena and a couple of songs can be. That's. The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone connected with the film will be disappointed, including the Mumbai Indians as well (just now Chennai has reached the semifinal). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie are the action scenes. Today Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood action scenes. But they forget that Hollywood directors have a lot of effect to make it look real. But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend their time on songs and publicity of the film. Now, those too stupid action scenes can work in the south, since the audience pays to see their favorite actor killing a group of people. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. All the action scenes I wish I had resent. In the end, even some Chinese appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The audience is not paying to see that stupidity. I think now Bollywood should forget about action movies. They can not do it. The last good action I have seen was of "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action movies like me. Do these people see your movie after it's finished? Can not you realize that the action in slow motion (which is done with strings) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to the time of Amitabh where films like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the scenes of the current era. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please, do not do more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic.
