This movie is poor trash. It has a horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in the script, although it is supposedly based on real events, which does not add much to anything, but makes it more disappointing. The direction is not well done since the scenes and the dialogue are out of place. I'm not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. For starters, Williams is not convincing as gay in a breakup of a relationship nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is bound by an ugly pedophile story that is the basis and has no place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin that puts "d_ck_smker" in his mouth without grace, which is quite annoying and then he laughed at Williams' character. Finally you have Sandra Oh as an advisor to Williams' guardian angel and an explanation of all the failure to the end. The character of Toni Collete is simply annoying and a repetition of his performance in the sixth sense with a poorer direction. Very unavoidable.
