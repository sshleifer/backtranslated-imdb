Oh my God, what a horrible movie. The film has all the people involved, unfortunately it's not worth seeing. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to see this I would be even more upset. This movie can not be seen. How could Tarintino get involved with such a slow and unexciting movie? No wonder there has not been much distribution, everyone involved must have felt ashamed. I can make a better movie with a date camcorder and my big toe. It's more than boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost something standing in my eyes. This must be a kind of sick joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone insinuates you should see it, kill them.
