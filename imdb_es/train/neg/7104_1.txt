The producers of this film offer to pay the funeral expenses of anyone who dies of fear while watching this movie. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. A young couple moves to a house, where lived a woman who looks like the woman of the couple. Extremely boring, and very predictable. In the end, I finished without worrying about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
