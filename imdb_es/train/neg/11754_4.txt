I must admit that I am a big fan of this program, so you must know how disappointed I felt when I saw this movie. First, the plot was horrible, I thought it would be something more interesting, like seeing what happened to Arnold's parents, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places , many people try to stop this. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the plot was not so bad after all, but what really stung were the steps that Arnold and his friends made to stop this maniac, they became friends of a spy,; They drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and to make matters worse, they make super movements on the bus, things that many people had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are experts in a videogame. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mother, my sister, even me, I was very disappointed after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to end up with a really good caricature. I must admit that I used to enjoy "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my favorite Nickelodeon cartoons, but after this movie shit, I'm not sure if I'll see "Hey Arnold!" as I used to see it in the past. <br /> <br /> Another Nickelodeon thing, with that huge amount of dynamite I can assure you that it would not explode a simple street, I think the whole city could explode with that. Oh, and please, if all your future films of good cartoons are going to be like that, do not make more movies, you give a bad review to the cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show transformed into this movie shit.
