I know people and did some of the animations and graphic design, and the show is horrible! They are rich little children who have no talent, and probably only begged Nick to accept them! Alex has played drums for one year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and so is the show! This is the most disorderly and crazy comedy that is even funny I've seen. It's so stupid that it makes me want to throw up! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon ever accepts something like that and so stupid! They are so stupid and weird! I hate them and their program and I think that once Nick realizes how stupid he is, we can expect them to be taken away!
