<br /> <br /> According to the reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20-year-old university students who are about to enter graduate school. Jolly joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The keyboard of the synthesizer was not invented yet, but there it is in the music kiosk. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there is playing oldies music. The synthesizer seemed to be a model from the mid-1970s. The Pony Car at best is from the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old college students? Josh Brolin had seen 32nd birthday when this movie made for television was produced. <br /> <br /> The plot is so predictable that viewers have a lot of free time to think about all the errors that appear on their TVs.
