Well, I must say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. The jokes were extremely crude (I did not expect it like a PG movie) (PG Rating in Canada) and they were not fun! With this great cast at least I expected some good performance, but I did not even get it. I'm a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time that I was very disappointed in his performance. Neither the characters of Luke Wilosn nor Uma Thurman are anything pleasant and I really did not care what happened to any of them. I did not expect this at all, since in the past I really liked other films by this director (for example, Six Days, Seven Nights). This movie was NOT worth the $ 10 it cost me and I recommend you not watch this movie. . I guarantee you'll be like me begging this movie to end.
