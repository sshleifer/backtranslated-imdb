I do not know what they're talking about, the first time I saw this movie with two of my friends, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest shits I've seen in my life. That comment about porn is very correct, although hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is actually worse, but it made me cry because of the fake characters, the bad dialogue and the acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it! It looks like one of those movies outside of my ed drivers. class. The accessories look like they came out of a high school drama program. The music sounds like it's from an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that came up to scare me from this movie was that I had a killer clown who, who does not get scared with the fat and lurking clowns? hahaha if anyone ever saw this, however, they should be aware of the verbal errors of the actors, such as listening to words and some of their facial expressions. hahaha I died <br /> <br /> SUSAN
