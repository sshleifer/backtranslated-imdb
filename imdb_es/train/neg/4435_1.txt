Gods, I have not seen such a horrible movie in a long time. Maybe not from 'The New Guy' or several films by Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's amazingly horrible. Mira Sorvino's white and wooden performance must surely have been inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was uncomfortable (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well in the movie). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was horrible and her sex appeal did not exist here, so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and 'falling in love' with it. And what happened to the occasional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Absurd! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would have been a self-inflicted pain to finish this movie.
