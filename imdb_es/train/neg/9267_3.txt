After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series reaches the bottom with this fourth very weak entry. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while the latter simply repeats and copies ideas from the "Omen" (the animals fear the Antichrist, the death of a man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first movie). But what seemed exciting and creative there seems silly here. And the girl looks just like a spoiled child.
