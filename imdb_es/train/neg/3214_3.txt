First of all, I would like to tell you that I like comics, anime, animation and those things. It is true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I'll be objective To begin with the story, it's fine. Follow the line of the history of comics to where I am familiar with them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and adhere to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare effects neglected like fire and lightning, we could say that the film was made about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original 1985 Vampire Hunter D. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, for example. Four years ago they made a movie that looks much better. In addition to this, the announcers do not do anything extraordinary, music is nothing special. So, in general, it lacks atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say that I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. It may be surprising for someone who has never seen more mature oriented animations and see animated blood for the first time (is there anyone nearby?), But I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and seasoning to it. The girls that surrounded Lucifer were pretty tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death! There are few sexy looks, but that is not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. In general, the movie is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, the Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, the Fire and Ice of Ralph Bakshi or Wizards, maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
