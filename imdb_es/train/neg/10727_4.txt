The movie is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good and funny story to come. Well, I can tell you that it will not come. It will deteriorate in minutes in a movie that defies his patience, as well as his feelings of shame for the actors in an extent that he probably will not be happy to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of people in this globalized world experience. I was surprised to hear that. Am I living in the same world in which you live? OK, many people walk with the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all that, but that does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are nothing more than the clothes we wear and the movies we see? Am I myopic or is it him? <br /> <br /> Well, my vote: the good start of the movie saves it by getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
