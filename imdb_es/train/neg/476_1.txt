When converting a book into a film, it is generally a good idea to keep at least part of the tone or concepts conveyed by the author, rather than completely ignoring the author. While it is clear that the director had access to and followed the advice of the children of Elinore Stewart, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar when it came to the good, enriching and empowering experiences of the hacienda. her land. . The book details her life in her and the neighboring houses of her husband in the vast border of Wyoming; she narrates the daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, although they lived tens of kilometers away. The film, however, adopts a standard stance during the time it was made, presenting the experience of this woman as harsh, implacable and almost useless. Maybe the director brought some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie (as some fans have said to the movie), but it seems to be a bad excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a devastating , Odious landscape without friends or hope. Do not waste time with this movie; read the book instead.
