I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and I joined my friends to watch a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we had not seen was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go for that. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. This is a movie that could only attract children. Oh, and it's not that I do not enjoy movies aimed at the younger audience. But this movie had absolutely nothing to get my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. Better than spending hard earned money on this. Go see the movie if you are a child or if you are a father with a child :)
