I just stumbled upon this movie channel surfing. My first reaction was: 'Oh God not again!' It is so modern to play at a delay these days that it has become pretentious and frankly despicable. However, for some reason, I stayed and saw it until the end. Maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping that they would give me something to cheer me up. <br /> <br /> and surely, Ken and Helena can act. In addition, the film moves towards something better towards the end and really makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a bad side that she uses to keep her distance and repel compassion. Then again she has a soft side that only seeks love. the only thing that surprised me even more was the character of Branagh ... this was a triumph of the performance, the film itself is nothing unique. <br /> <br /> see if you are an acting student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. It is serious penn! Oh, that was a little hard, since it has a couple of jokes ... but not for escapists.
