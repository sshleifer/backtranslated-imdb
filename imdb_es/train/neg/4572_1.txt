This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify meaningless ideas, limited by statements such as "we all create our own reality". <br /> <br /> Sorry, friends, reality is what is true for all of us, not just the gullible. . <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not contain water in a closer examination: if something is possible, contrary things are possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to a postmodernist nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate the established truths so that all ideas, founded and stupid, are the same. <br /> <br /> To quote the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who expressed it so well: "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, does not disappear."
