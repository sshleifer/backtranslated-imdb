1st seen 8/3/2003 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A nonsensical 3D movie about zombies eating meat in a story of 3 in a movie chronicle. And yes, we can see zombies eating parts of human flesh in 3D! Wow, no! That has been done again and again in 2D in a zombie movie, but what generally makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story, not the real meat to eat. That's what made the original classic zombies good. Eating meat was thrown in as an extra. Actually, we are bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle, because the lame (like the twilight zone) is easy to understand and the ending is revealed at a slow pace. The last story is actually the story with which the movie started (having a reporter research the so-called ghost town) and, of course, we can also see meat eating zombies in that. Well, I think I've said enough. Look at the classics, not this boredom in 3D.
