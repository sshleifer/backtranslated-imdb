This really was a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends abruptly with many gaps ... although the animation is first class. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might be interesting at the later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the biggest hole in the plot was the whole story about how to kill the bad guys ... The writer could have done a lot more with the whole concept, but It seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> In general, too much hype but was not able to offer.
