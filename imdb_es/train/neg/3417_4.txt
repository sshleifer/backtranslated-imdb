Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to lower this tone. Let's be realistic!!! Nobody wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stunk. I have to wonder if old Chuck can no longer handle the best. Has the speed you have to turn trash like this decreased so much and hope your reputation takes you through the whole movie? Chuck is an impressive martial artist, and as we have seen of Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both qualities in his films, and this one does not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, he's still the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you ... Gary
