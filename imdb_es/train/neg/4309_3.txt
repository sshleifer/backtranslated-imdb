A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but also a catalyst for her new ways of winning. Are you really surprised? Along the way, a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packed together with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really makes this film without service. This can be easily edited in a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her small outfits, but she expected more than the simple excitement of an R-rated movie. A side story that involves a dorky center that is hypnotized by her peers of team to think that it is the former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's new success instead of Cathy Lee's training. Too much mockery and not enough sleaze makes this a big disappointment.
