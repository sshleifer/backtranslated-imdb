It is a horrible little production, apt to give nightmares and headaches. It's an unsightly mix of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip that any optimist might expect. It's the kind of strange cold, inhuman, hostile, disgusting, even creepy. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more attractive things with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of fear.
