Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director in any way, but imagine what he could have done with this! The plot has a lot of potential for suspense. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is terribly against the guy. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive lady leader, but the cast of support is great and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to give up pretty soon. There are too many coincidences. And an important theme is trivialized by becoming little more, in the end, than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and the characters. But it is not very good.
