Although I had heard that this movie was a bit dry, I see what Scott Bakula is. At the beginning of this film, I had high hopes for the classic and funny ending of Scott-gets-girl and up to 20 minutes before it was over. It's going well The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very smart. I kept my fingers crossed to make it work and everything would be a horrible misunderstanding, until the credits rolled and I realized that there was not going to be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I was sorry I saw it and hurried to take a big leap to restore my faith in the goodness of Great Scott!
