After watching "The Bodyguard" the night before, I felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br /> This could have been a pretty decent movie if it had not been for the horrible camera work. It was more than annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. The close-ups were even horrible. <br /> <br /> In the story, Sonny Chiba hires himself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to take him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite right with Chiba. The participation of Lee in the network of drug traffickers is deeper than Chiba thought, since Mob and another gang of thugs chase her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and, despite the horrible dubbing, this could have been a good movie. Given a better direction and editing, I'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another cheesy action movie from the 70s. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a family date for "Pulp Fiction" fans, and then continues to a school karate in Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
