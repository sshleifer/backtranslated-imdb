You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and speaks, is played by Stephen King. "Do not give up your daily work" is the standard, but that is not fair. King declares himself reasonably well: no worse than any other cast member, and better than most. History, on the other hand, is pure garbage. Please, give up your daily work. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many frightful performances, of which the main actor (the MAIN ACTOR!) is probably the worst, reunited in the only movie. Everyone acts crazy, but not in an entertaining way; Somehow, everyone manages to get to the top without spending, or manifesting, energy. I blame screenwriter / director Tom Holland. It can not be that ALL actors are REALLY that bad. What are the odds against that? It is true that I had never heard of any of them before, but even so, I do not think I could go into a talent agency and leave with so many bad performers if I tried: AN actor, despite my best efforts, would go crazy . have talent So, what is more likely? That Tom Holland shot a dozen consecutive snake eyes, or that he wrote a lousy script and then mishandled it? That would also explain why the actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script. The more direction an actor had, the worse he worked. ("Do you want me to lean like a hunchback, speak from the back of my throat, show all my teeth and look bored, all at the same time? Ok ...") <br /> <br /> This The theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland, without a doubt, managed to co-write a very bad script. Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but that is a deceptive way of saying it. It is not a knowable character. Everything we discover about him before supernatural things begin to happen is that he is fat, and all he can think about is food. ("All I can think about is food," he tells us, kindly.) And in the end ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I guess I should insert a spoiler warning here ... <br /> <br /> In the end he becomes bad. Why? I can only shrug my shoulders. Maybe it's under some kind of enchantment. Yes, that is probably. By "bad" perhaps I mean "inexplicable": it is not so much evil as a socially undesirable suspension of the ordinary psychology of the media. Anyway, their actions at the end do not make sense, nobody's actions make much sense, and this despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the public. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my nominee for hammiest line / delivery: "I do not think you like it, ACTUALLY ..." [great dramatic pause] "... I do not think you like it at all . "
