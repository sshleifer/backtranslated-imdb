Woody Allen, when he is at his best, has one of the sharpest pens. He can make a sharp observation and wrap it around a line of blow like nobody else. However, when it is at its worst, your films may smell pretentious. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening to closing. Start-up is one of your most interesting ideas at one time. Four friends sit in a restaurant to discuss whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help solve the argument, a man tells the beginning of a story and asks the other two men who argue (one is a comic playwright, the other a dramatic dramatist) if the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men continue the story and the film shows the stories they weave. Now, when I first heard about this movie, I understood that they tell the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes depending on how you look at it. Now that would have been interesting. However, the stories only share one main element and some secondary elements. They are completely different stories with big plot differences. The drama is so rigid with script and pretentious that it can only really work as a self parody. If this was the point, it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling an emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Obviously, Will Farrell is destined to be Woody's understudy, but he could have played this character in a much more credible way without adding Woody's stutters and ticks. Woody is the best at being Woody. When someone else tries, is not playing a character, is modeling a recognizable actor. These kinds of things only get the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite films of Woody Allen make me leave the theater a little more in spirit than I entered. This made me wish I could get my money back
