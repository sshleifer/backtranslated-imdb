This game has the (dis) honor of being the first game in which I stopped playing right in the middle and I felt like I was breaking into pieces and then burning myself. Congratulations. FIRST AND LAST Tomb Raider I will never play, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: just writing that word made me laugh. There is no one There is no development of the character either. Finally, we have a female heroine who can take care of herself, who is not a mary * sue * beep, but unfortunately she dresses like a whore and her chest is huge. They had to attract the sexist players you see. Anyway, all she does is go to grave after grave shooting things as she goes. Why she does this, I have no idea. He had subtitles in and the t.v. As strong as I could and still did not understand a damn thing. The development (or lack of it) for her, her two friends and the * villains * were laughable. There will also be levels that you will have to go through to give you no clue about what you have to do next and, literally, you will be in most of the boring tombs like hell during HOURS trying to discover what the hell you are. It is supposed to be doing. There is a course (of every two) in particular with her on a motorcycle (Believe me, it is not fun at all) where she will be ON FOR ONE HOUR without a point in sight. That means you get hit by the other motorists and the guys in trucks that shoot you, or if you hit a tree, you start the OVER hour trip. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know that it allows the levels to be very long, basically they do not have save points, they do not have history, there is no character development, they do not give variety in the game, they have Most of the music in the longer levels and do not give clues to the player so they can stay longer in one place instead of reaching the non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: Those sounded like an explosion of ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or boring game. <br /> <br /> Todd: Sorry, sir, but it seems that these ideas are going to make the player go. <br /> <br /> Stupid boss F * ck: Shut up Todd. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Game: All she does is shoot. Of course, she can flip while SHOOTING, jumping while SHOOTING or kicking while SHOOTING again. But flipping, jumping and kicking does not eliminate the fact that all you are ultimately doing is SHOOTING. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The introduction music is extremely beautiful. I love listening to it. The music of the game is tolerable to want to cut your ears. <br /> <br /> Visuals: taking into account that this game was made in 2006, I expected the images to take my breath away. Well, I was impressed, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this game has no frames, there is not a problem of character development with a young woman barely dressed and without tide (THANKS) to the head that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason ( what could it be that I could not tell you) with an unimaginative shooting game. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡.
