** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Jason (aka Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most faded screen car crash of the history. Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes his friend to his mansion and rejuvenates his head in his laboratory. The exterior of the mansion was allegedly filmed on the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown; The lab scenes were apparently filmed in someone's basement. The bandaged head is kept alive in the "laboratory equipment" that is economical enough for Ed Wood. Some of the music in the library, the highlight of the movie, appeared later in THE BODY BENEATH by Andy Milligan. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another one of Ever's mistakes, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, good doctors prowl the joints in search of a body worthy of his wife's Gabby noodles. The end, in impressions without cuts, presents some splashes and dismemberments before time when the monster with zucchini head comes out of the closet to bring the film closer to the film. This thing took three years to be launched and then, the public gave it the bad reception it deserved. Among this, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and some others, 1959 should have been declared The Year of Turkey.
