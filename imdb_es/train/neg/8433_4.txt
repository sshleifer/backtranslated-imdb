Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels totally empty and decides to go out to get drunk. When he returns home, he crashes with a girl who puts ads. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and begins to follow her, obsessively. Well, the beginning of the movie is a bit slow and can be boring for most people. However, as the action starts, it's a bit better (not much!) Maybe the best part is the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes) that you can see in the middle of the movie; for eroticism, but for how funny and unexpected the scene is, it's probably the best thing in the movie, neither the actors nor the direction are good, and the result is a boring movie that can be fun for some people (not for me The whole movie is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the movie says), that have something interesting, I like Ventura Pons, but I must admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe the worst!), He knows how to do it better.
