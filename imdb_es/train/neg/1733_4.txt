SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> Suffering from the 'hornophobia', Ollie embarks on a 'relaxing' boat trip, but he and Stan mingle with an escaped convict (Rychard Cramer). Chaos occurs. <br /> <br /> This long-running comedy - an entry that, however, breaks down as a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in its structure, the film culminates in a memorable trip through the ocean after the Boys were taken hostage by the villain Cramer (who shoots a gull to show how hard it is!). The gags are fine, but lack inspiration, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turned-director Gordon Douglas, formerly responsible for Ollie's first solo effort in the era of sound (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but his work here lacks measure. from pzazz. Right, but nothing special. L & H regular customers Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make appearances as guests.
