I did not like this movie for many reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I felt extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to be saved, at least for me, it would have to come out of the huge hole that I had dug. . Unfortunately, that did not happen. The two draws of the film for me were seeing Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. Afterwards, I felt disappointed and for all three, even though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them to find their "moments" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was a surprising lack of development of the character and an uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film in general is so badly written, directed and edited that the performance of anyone as an actor would suffer and be affected by it. I think the disrespectful way he treated the sexual abuse and the trite and insulting point of view of the small towns of the United States were the two main reasons why this film failed. As one critic pointed out and I agree, the film is almost impossible to market given that it is finished. I suspect that, or at least I hope (for the sake of the actor anyway) there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting room. It is sad for us, but if that is true, then the actors can feel at ease with that and feel a little good lending their talents and time to that failure. Ah, yes, and another thing ... I wished for once to be able to see an American movie that included the sadly missing but wonderfully bucolic settings, like the one in this movie where the main characters were not distracted and / or disrespectfully messing the side of the Country with pop cans, CD smashed and, as such, garbage!
