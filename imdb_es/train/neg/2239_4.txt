The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake has to be one of the most attractive and beautiful examples of "smart totty" that have been committed with celluloid. Of his time and his class, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher approaches. What was it about the actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who, like me, have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of this is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very poor and is from its time, very cheap. The song that covers the opening credits seems to last forever and is frightening.
