I just finished an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was forced and the right shuddered. The performance was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains almost expressionless. His eyebrows point to a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have been so easy to play the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each one playing their stereotyped gear in the plot, mostly random and sinuous plot. Cheese special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracted cinematography added to the instability. I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was unconvincing and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its general quality with something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on par with NBC's Hercules.
