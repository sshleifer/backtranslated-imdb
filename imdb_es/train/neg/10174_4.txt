I saw this in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently, because the Orion images were bankrupt, I think the movie had not been released a couple of years before. <br /> <br /> I have trouble remembering details, partly because I have not seen it in a long time, but I remember it as a very boring movie. I kept debating whether to leave there. The store was not interesting or attractive at all. It was an imitation Graffiti of America 3rd grade. <br /> <br /> None of the performances makes it worth seeing either. One of the biggest disappointments since a critic of a local newspaper gave him a high rating.
