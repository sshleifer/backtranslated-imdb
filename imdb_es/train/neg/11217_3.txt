So the wife and I just finished it despite the various threats of both of them to turn it off. For the most part, boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was very little emotion. The performance was atrocious, to the point where we actually laughed several times during some of the worst scenes (the lady of the church, for example). The dead sister was using paranormal means to get in touch with her live twin, although instead of sending useful information, she focused on trying to scare her, which was very much like The Ring. Instead of involving the police, I am sure that the earplugs she found had DNA everywhere, she devised a horrible plan to "catch" the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. I call it a horrible plan because in the end she also allows him to kill her, and the film fades to black. Bad dialogue, bad performance, bad ending.
