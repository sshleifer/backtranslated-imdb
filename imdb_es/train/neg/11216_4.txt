It's just okay to film about a twin woman who has disturbing visions of her sister in danger at home. Then he returns home to find that everything is wrong and that he will have to find out what happened to his sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that almost works but does not work. I really can not say why it did not work, but it was good enough to wish it was better, or at least I had gotten it right in the small things, like having the girls playing the twins in the flashbacks. be closer in size I think maybe that's what is wrong, there are many small things that are simply wrong.
