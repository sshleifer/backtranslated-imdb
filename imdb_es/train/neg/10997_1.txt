First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why the hell are they trying to sell a piece of low-budget trash on nightly television with the promise of a sick, offensive, disturbing garbage that any normal real human being with a soul could not see? <br /> <br /> What the hell is funny that a dog is hurt, that a grandmother kicks his head ... a man who blows his hand in pieces and two girls go to the bathroom? What the hell has come to this world for people to find comedy in something so completely sick? Anyone who thinks that this type of material is fun, should not even be allowed to walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear it's not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through sick garbage piles ... and they can not even achieve that.
