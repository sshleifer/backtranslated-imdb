Supposedly a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad southern stereotypes, with false accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American southerners, but it becomes a "baby in prison" movie, especially disguised, especially in its original uncut version. However, the overall performance is above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making the audience hate him, although he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There is also a role of change of pace for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lustful eaves, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") became a rather credible sadistic prison guard.
