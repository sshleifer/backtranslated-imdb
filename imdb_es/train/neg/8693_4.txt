I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for some years. This movie was far from making it look like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas has no mountains. I guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also very bad. They should have got Texas actors to play the roles. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. The movie is really sad, because it's a true story. I pray that the murderer will be found and condemned. The only good thing is that after his death, we now have the Amber Alert to help find missing children quickly after they are kidnapped.
