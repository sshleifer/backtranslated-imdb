A group of models is looking for an apartment to live in, and a local real estate agent shows them one. However, the models and the agent do not know that the "threshold of hell" is in the apartment and when it crosses, the demon "Dethman" is summoned to kill all those who are in his way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was accused of the murders. <br /> <br /> Although I am a champion of low-budget, micro-consumer and independent films, I can not praise this film. The creators take pride in their 24-hour filming program and at least one actor boasts of the DVD of his acting prowess, but I can not understand it. Why make a movie in 24 hours if one or two additional hours of editing make all the difference? And why take pride in acting poorly, meaninglessly and resulting in the poor delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> In much of the movie, the models are shown parts of an apartment by an agent real estate agent. The dialogue is clearly ad-libbed because no writer could have such an empty diction. The agent, in addition, clearly does not know anything about the house ... she focuses on the aspects of a house that nobody could care about, incorrectly explains the source of heat (did not see the radiator?) And says that the Vermin problem will be solved when they call "the terminator". Please, write a script. Some deviation is fine, but this was a disaster. <br /> <br /> And why did the girls move in models? Their careers did not make sense in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks the character and says something in the sense of "uncle, they'll be (upset)", which sounded more natural than any other line, even if it was out of place because of the other bad dialogue. <Br /> <br /> The demon did not make sense. I appreciated the attempt to explain how the "threshold of hell" jumps to random places on Earth (including chimneys in apartments), but why not explain where the devil came from? His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man. How does this make you a demon? (Also, why do we need all these Victorian flashbacks without dialogues and looks across a field?) I was exaggerated). <br /> <br /> The dramatic breaks between the lines were terrible. The character of Sam Bishop was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. Does each question require a pause, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a pause, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only point was to lengthen the waiting time ... but I would prefer to have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and then you lose more time accumulating the same credits twice). <Br /> <br /> Who was the character of Sam Bishop, anyway? He apparently "saw" all of this and was accused of killing the girls, but at no time was he in the part of the story with the girls. So, how did you see them? And if he did not, how did he know that Dethman killed them? And if he did not see Dethman, how does he know that Dethman is the spirit of Apostles? I was so lost ... was there even a scheme for a plot when this was written? <br /> <br /> The only part I found nice in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break I was given to get bored. I wonder what director Félix Díaz thought. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu reproduction), but I wonder about his film making skills. Although, by far, the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer was only better than all this waste of time). <br /> <br /> Sorry, I have to be so hard. . I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is an indication, Diaz can be of quality ... so, why did he choose to avoid that here? Maybe the world never knows.
