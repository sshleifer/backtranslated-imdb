There is a scene near the start after a shootout where the horses are running. If something red catches your attention it's because a white van is parked behind a bush next to the path. I thought I had seen wrong but this is it. A white van in a western. Did not you realize this? Oh, well, and I paid the best price on the rent. It will make you want to grab your friends and ask them to put 10 of the big ones and make a better movie. The conversation was very slow, the performance was good for the most part, but it could not be taken seriously due to the bad nature of the filming. There is a door in the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular cut. I say watch this movie and move Cabin boy to number 2 in the worst of times.
