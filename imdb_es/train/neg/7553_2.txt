A phenomenal achievement in horror. Actually, it's hilariously horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage must now have reached the final in the Over-Emoting category in his acting class. With new hair plugs and a face that has been raised so many times, his nailed back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back, not only oozing a sick smarmies but creating a "hero" character in the that has no personal interest. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happens with Neil Labute and the female characters. He makes the females totally devious and evil ... and he gives them back the money by having Cage hit several of them directly in the face and call them all "b **** is" sometimes as well. I enjoyed the first LaBute films and some of his works ... but it is a strange fascination that he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 based solely on the performance of Ellen Burstyn. The moment he finally makes his appearance (soldier bravely through his scenes with his wig line clearly visible on his forehead) it seems that all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar here and now for saying her lines with a serious face and when she appears dressed in a white and blue, white and gold mumu painting that grows on The Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepared her for she. This role is fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is so reckless and you should see the cuckoo to believe it. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage fleeing a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bicycle and looks like Mrs. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding on it. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage running around the island knocking down doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING of an actor career that was once promising in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dancing around said while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage shouting "Who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it?" for no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear foot) and then doing some karate moves to some villains. <br /> <br /> And you have not lived until you've seen the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrible epilogue that seemed to have been filmed yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you can get over this movie without laughing out loud, then you deserve a medal. In fact, there was a point in the movie where I stopped laughing to ask myself if maybe it was not an elaborate "hysteria" movie post ... just to remember when Cage shouted / shouted / whispered in his dialogue that It really was being taken very seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this is meant to be a cult movie again ... just because it's so terrible.
