A new version of Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this time with a breathing mask, as a guide. For the dubious advantage of a sound track in English, we support Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as always, with zero depth. Yes, the character identifies with his person, but usually we are given a character below to maintain our interest. His empty posture denies any erotic energy that might have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an acting exercise that consists of wearing masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of the character through words and body. language means The masking of Cruise only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. See the original Amenabar 1997 Open your eyes!
