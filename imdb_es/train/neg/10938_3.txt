I did not expect much from this, but I was still disappointed. This was my least favorite Halestorm production I've seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just made fun of 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny joke to see a fat man eating donuts and falling again and again? What was happening with the doorman in the scene of heaven? Fred Willard has been very funny with some of his contributions from Christopher Guest, but this did not work. They must have spent the entire budget on getting "well-known" actors to appear because there was no budget for lighting. It seemed that it was filmed with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it really take that much film to show someone who actually shoots and makes a basket, instead of cutting and editing a ball that goes through a basket? I try not to be too critical with low budget comedies, but if you want to see something fun, go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.
