I admit that I did not give this movie a chance. I decided very early that this was not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it looks excellent in terms of its cinematography. The Manhattan scenes of the early 70's look very good, as does the lead actress. It is a very sharp black and white, which could almost make the film feel undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques that filmmakers use to shoot that perspective into hell. The disjointed edition is VERY late in the 60s, somewhere between surrealism and the new wave. History also feels as if it came from a very specific moment, somewhere between the idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a city girl as she looks for a man who had an anonymous phone. sex with When you meet other strange characters, reveals their peculiarities and they reveal theirs. The film seems destined to be an irreverent comedy, but it adds a cutting edge feel. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: Near the end of the movie, a character tells an anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes? - brutal to sit down. In addition, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found coarse and youthful that serves as a highlight of the film. I laughed out loud four or five times and I liked the ending (except the disgusting animation). And when the film changed color for the final phone booth sequence at night, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences in which I felt that I would have liked it a lot if it had been a little different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. It's dark, artistic and left to the left of the dial, but none of them is a reason to recommend it on your own. It did not seem unique or creative, but forced and pretentious.
