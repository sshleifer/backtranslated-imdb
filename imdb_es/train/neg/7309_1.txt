I have rented and seen this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any criticism about it. Then, after 15 minutes of watching it, I have noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's terrible! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious. <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be fun ... (So stupid, is it funny ... BAD? !) Must see and learn from better horror comedies such as "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! Those are fun! <br /> <br /> "Cabin fever" is the reason why I registered at www.IMDb.com to be able to express my thoughts of discontent about it. <br /> <br /> I've decided to watch the movie for the second time> AAARGH! <and make notes for my partial "review" to show how stupid the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Comedy) I can watch again and again and keep enjoying! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and a director be? That's bad. Here are the terrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the first scenes we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog is lying on the floor with his tongue hanging from his mouth and his glazed look . Dead! <br /> <br /> The movie does not explain anything about the long-haired blonde guy who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing". The script makes that bearded guy warn them about the forest just for "suspense". <br /> <br /> Then, the "smartest" of the pack of 5, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets the now infected Henry, who asks for help and from here in the film he wants to break the record using the "F word". Bert starts going crazy because Henry looks very sick. Bert: "Do not make me shoot you!" (he forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert goes to the cabin, but what about that? Meet Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now they suddenly decide to go for a walk! Marcy, wisely, eliminates the unguarded bonfire that Bert had initiated before (a moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the Five Stupid sit around his campfire, another weirdo appears with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the forest is about, is it full of weirdos ... and their dogs?) They let him sit with them just because he has a huge bag full of cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! It's no wonder why they are so ALSO!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character ... I live! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in his cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few meters from his cabin!) Looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But young Einstein refuse to help the poor. He gets into his unlocked truck which, of course, also has his key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to get the hell out of there, but instead he starts vomiting blood all over the board, the seats and the windows. The Fantastic Five run off, armed with: a BB gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* eh? Did you ever try playing baseball in the middle of the woods?), A poker and a spray (insecticide?) Can, ready to fight the single man, unarmed and terribly sick. (Clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What else am I supposed to do?" Bert screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock down Henry with his bat and poker, but they get lost and the windows of the truck collide. Henry approaches the silly girls who say: "He's coming to us!" (Thanks for the information, silly, I can see that! But I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy throws a spray in her eyes, making Henry scream! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning trunk of the campfire, which they imprudently left burning while they were inside the cabin. (Where has all that wisdom gone? I think cannabis had started to take its toll!) :) Henry becomes The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff are heading. for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "go in search of help" alone, in the woods, while Paul stays behind with Karen ... Does not that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "going for help"! <br /> <br /> Now I omit my comments on how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE paddling over a huge and sinuous river! How did you get a canoe? Does she know where she is going? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very large and apparently abandoned cabin and, as in most horror movies, she walks inside the cabin saying: "Hello, is there anyone there?" Bert suddenly gets up from behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff, too. How did they get here !? Did they swim on the other side of the river? See how careless the script is !? <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul in the booth. Somehow he does not notice the blood in his truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself more and I have released the DVD. (Before I put out my own eyes! ... Now, THAT is funny!) <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and look at "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" , or "The return of the undead." Then you will see that they are more entertaining than this ... thing. Even the "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a bad movie, is much more fun than "Cabin Fever".
