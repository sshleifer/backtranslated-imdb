An unenthusiastic attempt to bring Elvis Presley to modernity, but despite an unattractive bathroom scene and a pseudo-Playboy subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same clich√©s. A woman collects E.P. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life, and it seems that he does not care! Dick Sargent is tiring in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Strive like the two Elvis bosses (he sees the moonlight). Some of the songs are quite good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a more relaxed and modern Elvis sexual comedy, look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal Attraction lie down together, there is actually a wooden board between them! Be realistic ** since ****
