"I Am Curious: Yellow" is a laughable and pretentious smoky stack. It does not matter what one's political opinions are, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that is not true. I have seen films rated R with male nudity. Of course, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated movies with open vulvas and vagabond lips? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for those shitty cable shows: rumors swing in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we invite you to see the site of the pulsating Johnson by Vincent Gallo, but not a trace of pink visible in Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) "double standard" in questions of nudity, the mentally obtuse must take into account an unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when the actresses appear naked, and you can not say what same. for a man In fact, generally you will not see female genitals in an American movie in anything that is not porno or explicit erotic. This supposed double standard is less a double standard than a certainly depressing capacity to reach a cultural agreement with the interior of women's bodies.
