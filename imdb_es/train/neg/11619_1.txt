I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to really happen. Maybe it's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange re-narration of the oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I did not understand why certain elements of the plot were even present: why was the construction on the top floor, why was there that great staircase with a perfect place for someone to fall to their doom if nobody was going to do it, why the scenes not at all with the father at work, why have such a nice kitchen if you're only going to eat takeaway, why would you want the child to be baptized and that the parents be the ones who would resist instead of the other way around? I see many good reviews for this movie ... has my taste been corrupted by uploading 70s films and science fiction movies?
