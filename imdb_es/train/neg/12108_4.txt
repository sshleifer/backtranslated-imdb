I just had to write that lining, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I have compliments for everyone involved in most aspects, except the most important, the script. It's a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of thin film or black and white style can compensate for the total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I heard that he will make another film about the general. My advice is to not waste your time.
