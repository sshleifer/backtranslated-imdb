I think the biggest flaw that something can have is to be bored. The bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American movies of the 30s take place in Cambodia? However, the conflict there is a bit difficult to resolve. Even the movements of the troops are a bit confusing. What draws him to a resounding stop is the love story. Why are those two guys so totally paralyzed with the blonde that I do not know? I thought I should continue using their Zombies (as they are) and forget about it. The movie simply advances along. The perfect microcosm is when one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphs (or whatever) are stored that explain how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. A boy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other boy hides behind some columns. Take two steps He stops. He looks around. The other boy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a few words. Then there is the bad performance and the insipid dialogue. In fact, I have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This is unbearable. By the way, a more apt title would be Revolt of the hypnotized.
