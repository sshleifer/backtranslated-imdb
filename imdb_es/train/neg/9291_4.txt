I can not believe that NONE of the official reviews of this film warn people that it contains two scenes of sexual assault quite disturbing. It is as if our culture accepts this type of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these assaults, as in the case of the woman who is assaulted and pressured repeatedly, she never blames men for her actions, and nobody else does. A man is prevented from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but is only reprimanded with "you can not force a woman to love you" instead of "you should never force a woman sexually, imbecile" ... The point of view of a woman, the movie is a disappointment. It's like "throwing a bone" at women to be fighters and skilled leaders, but the film is much more defined by romance, which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love This incredible martial arts fighter uses none of his fighting skills to try to defend himself against his attackers. She does not even make them apologize, rather, SHE seems to apologize. In general, a depressing and disturbing movie, with a great cinematographic picture and some scenes of great fights, but not as good as Hero by far.
