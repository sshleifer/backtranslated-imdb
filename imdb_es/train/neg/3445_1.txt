When young Kevin receives his dead uncle's ship as a gift, he invites five of his friends to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. While they are on the trip, they drink alcohol, have sex and play games, and each of them tells him their greatest fear. Later, Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are persecuted and killed for their greatest internal fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, my son, my daughter and three other friends came together to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of run time, the group stopped seeing this messy and boring amateur crap, and we decided to watch another movie. Later, I decided to see the rest of this movie to see how serious it could be and it would have been better to go to bed to sleep. The confusing story has a horrible film and camera work, with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses, and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of the film school. The terrible and pretentious script shows a ridiculous turn at the end, really a complete disorder that made me not understand what the story is about. Was the girl crazy and traveling alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If that is true, are your friends again in the final fruit of your madness? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Journey to death")
