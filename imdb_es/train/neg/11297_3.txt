Jenny Neumann (from the sexploitation film MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who gets a leading role in an Australian theatrical production. She is a virgin because as a child she saw her mother having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a murderer in black gloves wanders around the theater cutting people with pieces of glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, she washes the blood from her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle like a little girl), but this has a free POV camera job that breathes with difficulty and hides the identity of the Assassin until the end, as it is supposed to be a big surprise. <br /> <br /> The whole cast seems obsessed with talking, having or trying to have sex and, in one case, even blackmailing their way to get a job. There is a lot of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, the photography is murky and the editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. However, the theatrical setting for a slasher movie predates the Soavi movie of the same name and the OPERA of Argento (which are better than this one) for five years, and Neumann is quite fashionable.
