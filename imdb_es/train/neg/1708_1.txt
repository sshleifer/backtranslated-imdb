Well, I really do not have much to say about this movie, other than this: I've seen more than 4,000 movies in my life, and more than 2,300 of them were horror movies. While I have some difficulty in deciding which is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can say is DAWN OF THE DAD, by George A. Romero), I can tell you without the slightest doubt that the ZOMBIE BLOODBATH by Todd Sheets is the absolute. The worst horror movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing positive I can say about this movie. The acting, the dialogue, the direction, the make-up, the music ... All the aspects of this film are simply far below what is acceptable, and I am surprised that this has been published. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a horror movie or zombie complementist, pay attention to my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage. There is no pleasure to be gained from seeing this. You will not even get any laugh at the absolute ineptitude on display ... Trust me. Please.
