Imitating his long title, the film finds ways to approach the 90 'brand. The beautiful sceneries are here with everything that made the values ​​of Hamer's production become a commercial brand, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent abandonment. The story is obvious and can be summarized in a dozen words, so there is nothing unexpected or anything that is worth more than 5% of your attention. <br /> <br /> The direction is heavy as a direct transfer from the On stage, the actors are mostly rigid as wax figures (well, this is a characteristic of Hamer, but sometimes it is better to appear in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is rubbish, it's not worth the time I spend that night. Eternal life is a boring affair and I should have expected that those in charge of programming at the Cinemathèque would have known better.
