This movie is really strange. There's really nothing good that I can say about it, besides the moral truth expressed in the climax of the film with respect to the people in the neighborhood involved in the fight against crime. In addition to all that, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good acting, no good script. I give this movie an F and a 2 out of 10.
