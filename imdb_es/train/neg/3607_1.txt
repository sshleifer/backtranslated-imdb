I'm starting this review with a big giant spoiler on this movie. Do not keep reading ... here it comes, avoid your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher movies, is murdered here. There I just saved you the 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that were released together in the middle of the eighties era. Despite having killed the heroine, this is just inferior trash. <br /> <br /> Both priests and university students receive a bad reputation here. They present themselves as sociopathic and overexploited imbeciles who have too many internal problems to deal with what seems to be college university life ... and university students are even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just put it on your VCR when you do not have anything better to do, although I suggest you see the cleaning tape on your head, that would be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is qualified (R) for its strong physical violence, gore, blasphemy, very short female nudity, and sexual references. <br /> <br />
