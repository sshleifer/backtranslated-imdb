The Leap Years stars some successes in the local and regional film and television scene. And yet, you can not save this movie. There are many things that go against that: acting excessively, being too melodramatic, a poor script, an inconsistent direction; and very few things in his favor: decent music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all the local movies in a basket after watching this movie and says that all local movies are bad. Please, do not judge the rest based on this movie. It is a television soap opera that is posing as a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were lost five minutes after the movie.
