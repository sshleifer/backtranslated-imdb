This quasi-J-horror movie followed a young girl as she returned to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell the family home and meet old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) find out that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the links between the dead and the living are weakening and friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or very good about this movie. Unlike the stellar J-horror films, the suspense does not really accumulate, the result does not seem to be too threatening and the ending ends in the absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a simple cooked white rice too. Long to be borderline to soft. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or you cook your own white rice a little too much. You end up eating it, because you need it with food, because it's Chinese or Japanese without rice, but it almost ruins the food by the sticky, sticky taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
