Spoiler! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein", but THIS - <br /> <br /> I can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but actually - the script went on, Bonham-Carter's clothes were three chic, and the occasional sequence of accelerated "crazy" could have been a result of a Beatles movie, or of old Rowan and Martin Laugh. In. <br /> <br /> I never understood the point: other commentators say that Branagh's character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. The business in the guise of a bank robber was simply painful to watch. It's certainly not fun. <br /> <br /> The realistic attempts of Bonham-Carter (it is supposed) as a realistic speech were more difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, with him on top of a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Return to the classics or something with a thorn and a bow. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
