William Russ is the main character throughout this television movie. He left his family behind so that he only reappeared and began to pay off his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo), who plays several different roles, comes in to convince him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is normal and they actually managed to get an old star (Peter Falk) and use it to a pretty good degree. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems that his performance is still good. <br /> <br /> The delivery and the story seemed very cheesy to me as to how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word by word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a film of poor quality. In a letter rating system, you would receive a "D".
