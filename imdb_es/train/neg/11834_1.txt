Let's say it in simple words so that even the creators of this film have the opportunity to understand: this is a very silly movie with an even more silly script, a boring animation and a story as original as the thumbtacks. Do not get upset, unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of adults with mental retardation or extremely slow children. They may laugh, especially if they are off their medications. There is a special kind of insult in such a ridiculous movie: not only do filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can entertain themselves with a trap that costs approximately zero effort, but they do not even bother breaking a sweat by inserting a gag Here and there an adult can find fun. This movie, frankly, made me very angry. It's your fault for crouching so low.
