Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about druids. What they find is a horrible story of cannibal assassins. <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize Evil Breed, it would be a low grade gore fest. The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn, all in one. It is simply a pity that the film has so many inconsistencies to track that it loses any "fun" that someone has seen. The movie has a lot of nudity of random "horror" ... although the movie also has four porn stars, and four, so there could have been much more. The breed also shows a good amount of blood. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a horrible start, with a laughable dialogue and a horrible performance. That is something that is given in a direct horror film to video, but this takes the cake. I really can not understand who the main character is, since the only woman who "lives" at the end is not really in the movie. Speaking of the end, that has to be one of the most random and fake endings in the history of cinema. He has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes his vision of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie to believe it, as there are some pretty great death scenes. There are two scenes of death that come to mind, one in which the innate murderer rips the intestines of a naked woman through his chest ... yes, his chest, do not ask me. The other identification when the guy receives his intestines, once again, is ripped through his ass. Does that kill the boy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines. These scenes remind me a lot of Dead-Alive, with just the right amount of humor in each one. I also had the feeling of Evil Dead, with the nonsense mentions of horror movies and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately; and to enter. <br /> <br /> Although, the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film. When the teacher gets up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her steps are so strong and strong that she seems to be wearing boots. In fact it distracts. As well as the continuity in the film, with only one consanguineous murderer? As well as what character dies at what time. I could not tell if the girl with breast implants was Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I can not remember. In addition to the random naked girl with a dead baby hanging from her body, still with the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The horrible edition also distracts, the initial credits are too fast and disorienting. It had a bad start and improved, but the ending simply takes the movie to a horrible level. If maybe there were better values ​​of production and more faith in this movie, then I would not have been horribly killed. Stay away from this movie, unless you are satisfied with the horrible bad movie with a decent budget.
