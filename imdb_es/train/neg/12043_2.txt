I like Brad Pitt a lot. He is an actor with intelligence and ingenuity, not to mention the face, the pectorals and everything else. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise" a thought has been bothering me, who do you remember? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious of course. Man, American, etc., but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind, nonetheless. He is so beautiful that he is more effective when he plays against him. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatching" His contemptuous humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only photographs with Pitt, semi naked in dazzling sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fanatics. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say no to the possibility of working with the new Brigitte Bardot.
