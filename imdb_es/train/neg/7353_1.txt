Seeing him now is still as thin and sexist as I remember. It comes from a time when girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically were men's toys. It is difficult to understand that it comes from the Hammer studios and that it is available on DVD when good movies are not. What a shame for our nations where the working class presents itself as timid and worse workers! The problem is that you can not help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to keep the contents of your stomach when you see Olive in a fluffy? A "spicy" blue nightgown or something similar to what Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. Warning: this movie shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo on a double-decker red bus, of which I have been informed not It's a Routemaster, but a Bristol. <br /> <br /> Look, do not bother seeing anything decent instead of Porridge or Dad's Army ... or a fly crawling on a wall.
