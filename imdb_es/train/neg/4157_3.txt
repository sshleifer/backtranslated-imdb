The above seemed like a much more appropriate title when I and my suicidal subordinates decided to see this masterpiece of modern shit. <br /> <br /> Erotic, scary, suspense, well thought, these are all the things that this movie can not be. . <br /> <br /> However, it's incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and the bad dubbing add to this to make one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years. And, nevertheless, this film does not even try to be funny and that is one of the great achievements of the film, it becomes a comedy without even trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an old man with an amazing look Santa goes around plowing zombies and crushing vampires against the ground. This made me stop believing the title of the movie, if this was vampires against zombies, why did vampires and zombies not fight? Oh, well, whatever it is, in addition, there were more flaws in this rent than in the title. Like this; There has been a virus sweeping across the United States creating zombies as beings that behave like the average tourist. And yet, there are only four zombies in the whole movie. Another problem is that besides a shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you would see zombies wandering in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact, I think they just drove into a forest circle again and again, since they did not have a budget high enough to shoot in a larger location, that or the director did not want to waste his precious filming time in different places . He was too busy sitting in a trailer to bother with such trivial matters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing this that he did not have enough time to hire a large enough cast or even a publisher. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress as different people and try not to act discreetly, while I assume he changed his name and began to randomly cut the film's reels. "Editing is not a difficult job, is it?" The only reason why this "movie" found its way into our bag was because somehow we confused it with Freddy vs. Jason, the strange thing is that these things do not happen. And the only way we could spend the night was by putting on gas masks and screwing them to our skulls to avoid the stench of this nauseating mess. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, we laugh at the end, but I'm sure you do that a lot when you've lost your sanity ...................
