There really is not much need to start this little review with a summary of the plot. I mean, is it Shakespeare's Hamlet for God's sake? Probably one of the best known works ever written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people in IMDb have done it. through Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the program may not be the best place to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to see it without the jokes. In a word, this German version of Hamlet made for television is sad. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to be something I want to spend almost three hours. I've said it many times, but entertainment is what's important to me. And this wrist cutter is far from entertaining. However, I will give you a couple of points for what I felt was a reasonably good performance. A 3/10 sounds good to me. <br /> <br /> Even though I enjoy MST3K, his comments do not help Hamlet to be more acceptable. There are some good riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too good at allowing comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts, I have to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
