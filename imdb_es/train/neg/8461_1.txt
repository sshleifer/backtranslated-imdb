I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so hard for the dollars that he would dishonor himself with such a shocking blow in this monstrosity. Hell: I will donate that money that I was going to send to Ethiopia if he is so desperate. I've never seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... who paid for this? They are pulling a tax scam or crazy. A 5-year-old child would be ashamed of the plot, and I would prefer to get cancer than sitting more than the time I already suffered. Everyone involved must be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give it minus 10 if possible ... amazing.
