Speaking only as a movie, I did not like it very much. Not because there was no FX or because we had a single booth as a stage for the whole movie, in fact that was what kept me watching it. <br /> <br /> I did not like it because the acting was murky, your "friends" are all happy and then they are angry, but you have no idea why; Then they take different roles, one is the believer, another is the antagonist, but in reality they never make the point! also, the lighting was terrible and I only mention technical problems. <br /> <br /> in a few words, I think the movie could have had an "ok, I'm leaving here". Of some characters. like the lady who does not want to hear your version of the bible. <br /> <br /> about the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is a test of good writing and imagination. . I give credit to the author of the book for that, therefore, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, listen to the story of the man, believe it or not, just do not spend all the time acting as you believe. he and he was surprised by what he says, and at the same time he moves and makes jokes as you do not believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thanks for reading;)
