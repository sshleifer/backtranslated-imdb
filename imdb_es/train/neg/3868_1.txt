If you are studying Welles and want to see how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse to turn the protagonist into a self-admitted fool to explain how he could fall into a half scheme does not explain the absurd theater of the court and the ridiculous turns of the plot that will eventually occur. Do not be fooled by the high rating of this movie in the db as I was; all I can guess is that there are a lot of Welles and Hayworth fans.
