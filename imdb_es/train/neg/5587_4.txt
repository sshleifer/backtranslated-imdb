In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although, apart from the popular "In the Core of the Earth," few of these have been filmed. An exception is the novel titled "The Lad and the Lion", presented on the screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), a movie too talkative, static, old, slow and quite boring, despite having been filmed. in real desert places. Actually, "movie" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but advances at the snail's pace in an abrupt series of idiots. For example, at least five characters have elaborate opening scenes and then simply disappear. Even more frustrating for the enthusiastic fan of the film, are the characters that cause a type impression (like the girl who drives Hall with drugged wine), but are represented by players who are not accredited! Accredited protagonists generally outperform strangers. An exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues the young Master Fairy. It is true that the majority of the cast is loaded with the atrocious dialogue of King James, who must be heard to believe it! But the way to play this garbage is ironic, a ploy that does not seem to have occurred in any of the untalented players in the film. Maybe the director J.P. McCarthy got angry with that idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to swap lines with people like Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her suitor). It is true that Mr. Hall offers his lines with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlyle, but that is not a recommendation.
