I'm sorry, but this is a movie so bad that funny. Soccer hooligans discussing in a travel hostel? Costumes? Shades?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, it is as far from the truth as can be understood. <br /> <br /> The casting was atrocious ... Gary Oldman is a soccer hooligan? He is not afraid, he is not afraid or presented as someone who would like football. And as for Yeti? What the hell? Costumes, shadows and sitting in a travel hotel provoking each other, "it's about time you put on your diaper". Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang spraying the ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10. It is possibly the most inaccurate portrait of the hooliganism crisis of the late eighties that I have seen.
