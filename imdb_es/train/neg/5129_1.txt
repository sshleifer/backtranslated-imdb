The message of this film is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not that ugly (she is actually much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood end with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message you want to convey, this movie is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />
