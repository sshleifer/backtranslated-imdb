This movie fails miserably on all levels. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and send them to a hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, everyone will be shot and we will not have to waste our time again. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about a bunch of cinematic garbage in my entire life? My God, I can not think of anything I've seen that was so bad. I prefer to see Ishtar 25 times in a row than to sit for 10 minutes of this excuse apology for a movie. If I ever meet someone involved in this movie, I'll spit in their faces and then beat them senseless. Those are my two cents.
