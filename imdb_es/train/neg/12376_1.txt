This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really enjoy some good fights. Man who sucks! Quick and eye-catching cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and the fights themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I'm thinking especially of the Jet Li fight in Fists of legend and the Jackie Chan fight of the drunken master 2). <Br /> <br /> And what's the deal with those street fighters ?! What is so "great" about that? I've seen more interesting fights in Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage the people who committed this shit to do more of this shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy the movies that were the fights and see the fights in his glory uncut!
