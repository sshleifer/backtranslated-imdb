The dialogue was quite terrible. The plot is not really all that inspired beyond the obvious turn it presents. Not visually impressive. Actually visually annoying sometimes. Definitely, one of those movies will be easier to finish if you keep a finger on the fast forward button. If you could see it for free, you have absolutely no other option open at this time and you really like to see the little poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I recommend it, but not anyone else I can think of at this moment.
