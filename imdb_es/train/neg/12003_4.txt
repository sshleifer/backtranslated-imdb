Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty numbers of the public in the cinema. Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories have no links to each other, but somewhere in the line Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationship between them. I tried to find some lines that I could write as a revision, but at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes I did not find anything to write. The movie is a bad copy of the Hollywood blockbuster. LOVE REALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to see a good movie.
