The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what to think before we think about it, has been realized. Is it some kind of miracle, or sinister joke, that people put on mental straight jackets of their own free will, twist in contorted shapes and smile like monkeys? Films, art, no longer risk the unknown, but they are lost, exhausted conclusions. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an insipid case story, suitable for a college feminism course for freshmen. His lesson is schematic, at right angles and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, mistreated and then thrown into the garbage dump by a society dominated by men." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, supposedly, was the "pin-up queen of the 1950s", the ass to which millions of men ejaculated. (All respondents repeat that phrase, "the pin-up queen of the 1950s," like a chorus of monkeys.) Her story as a US sex bomb is familiar: Southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this film is a naive, an innocent who does not realize the prosperous interests he serves and from which he benefits shamelessly. Although he believes in Jesus, he likes to play naked in front of a camera lens: only the healthy American men and sexual slaves next door supposedly fantasize. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of writer and director Mary Harron, educated at Oxford and ex-punker (do you smell the combined rottenness of privilege and "hipness" as I do?): "I feel that without feminism, I would not be doing this ... I do not believe feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I do find that women improve my films. " What a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film simply follows the movements of telling the story of a human life, since the theme and purpose were praised and buried long before the film began. Miss Page has a boyfriend, but she shows us almost nothing about their relationship. In fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the movie. <br /> <br /> One can not ignore his cocky simplicity. In New York, where Ms. Page does everything possible to adapt and appease a man's world, letting herself be tied to the ropes of slavery and tied to S & M's black leather boots and bodices, the film is black and White. But in Miami, where she walks away from everything, happily removes her clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, the film becomes a color. <br /> <br /> Like the hell that Harron does not do. "Making feminist films", does not "do anything ideological". Ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.
