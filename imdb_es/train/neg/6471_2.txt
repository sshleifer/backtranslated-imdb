This is a movie that is bad in every way imaginable. Sure we like to know what happened 12 years after the last movie, and it works at some level. But the new characters are simply not interesting. Baby Melody is horribly horrible! Unfortunately, while maintaining the logic that humans can not stay underwater forever, other basic physical logics are ignored. It's cold if you do not have cold weather clothes if you're in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here The rate of return of Jafar is worse, I thought this is more horrible.
