Although I was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits at the opening of 'Joshua'. Hell, I did not even know I was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying that I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the protagonists. It presented a kind of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' or any other demonic children's movie 'Joshua'. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. However, I continued to see how all this would be resolved, hoping, beyond the credible, that the final climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit it, it did (a little bit) but what a stale closure. And what low-budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls? You do not see the drop, you see someone lying in what appears to be blood. Is a person hit by a taxi? You do not see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bicycle. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a father addicted to work who tries to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who may / may not be the antichrist and a newborn girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she is alive? and what was it about? Are there rats up or is it Joshua? Is your mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he simply jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will you grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does it take your family to the edge? I do not think so. They were crazy before, and no "called" performance could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, almost no question was answered, almost no open door was closed. I'm sure that could have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are many better movies for wild children to explore. Joshua is more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist.
