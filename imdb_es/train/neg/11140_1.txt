I thought I was going to see a horror movie ... and I ended up laughing throughout the movie. In the scene where the human was transformed into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Under budget, it is an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects as it should be (human transformation to werewolf). Unless you want to laugh, I would not recommend you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
