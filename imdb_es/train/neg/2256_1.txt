I admit I've seen maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer." I do not consider myself a snob, but I really believe that I am above what is in your program. You must try to rise above that, too. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as part of a social studies event I was doing. I was told that this movie really had little to do with Springer himself, rather that he focused on the lives of those who would appear in "Springer." Handled better, this movie could have been really a fascinating look at just how pathetic the lives of these people are. I admit that I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all that she has in life. How sad it feels to go to Jerry's program to solve this. <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for the appearance of Molly Hagan in this. Have you noticed that after this movie, it has been relegated mainly to the "B" roles on television? I'll say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her performance and tries to interpret her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry a single scene. She simply does not have what it takes to play a leading role. Her best work will always be Angel in "Herman's Head" (a show that was not very good, but her heart was in the right place) and when she was invited to "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
