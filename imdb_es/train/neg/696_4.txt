Hey, it's not a good slasher movie in particular. So, acting, effects, soundtrack decent but familiar and not very innovative. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in a close succession near the beginning of the film that constitute a pretty good scene in which it seems that anything goes. Apart from that, there are many characters wandering around, unaware of what is going on, or chasing false leads; More killings of time, than of people. There are other deaths, and the murderer is an equal opportunity murderer, not partial to any implement. The killer also likes to prepare other people to kill innocent people. The identity is not revealed towards the end, and the reason is quite thin, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the film takes place at Christmas, but this is not an important factor. A scene lights up with the Christmas lights, that's all. <br /> <br /> The film is quite dark with a muddy image most of the time, at least on the videotape that I saw. Part of the dialogue was lost a bit in some of the initial scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We believe that we realize what happened, although there is a possibility that something else has happened.
