The German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has achieved a task that many horror fans thought was impossible: he defeated Teuton Uwe Boll for the director's crown of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This movie is as bad and ridiculous as EW's worst. I feel proud and ashamed to say that I saw it in its entirety, morbidly fascinated to see that the bar could be established. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the cast of nobody international. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many aspiring actors willing to spit their ridiculous dialogue with a serious expression. <br /> <br /> The main character, a police villain, is played by a German actor with a strong German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest policeman in Los Angeles. Even though it stops the innocent drivers and takes them into custody, then drag them into their house (which is inexplicably the top floor of a furniture store), and does all this in the sight of their newbie partners, the LAPD Deny Investigates, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja-style raid on his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are terribly bad. The budget of the production designer apparently included enough money for one can of paint; enough to paint the "Precinto 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> As the actors were obviously not unpaid professionals, a sad assortment of European émigrés (possibly deported if they acted in their homelands), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and as little or nothing of money was spent on sets, special locations or other production values, it is fair to mention that they made some police uniforms of genuine appearance. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed policemen roam the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the dirty facts of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young novices to stop him. One of these young actors is especially unfortunate because he is the only actor in this whole mess, even with a vague opportunity in a real film career. The other fits perfectly, with a rockabilly hairstyle and a tortured possessed by Brando that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie is where the title is your zombie, as the victims of our the murderer is resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to they put a protective spell on him. Do not ask why a Romanian girl would resort to voodoo before being killed, simply accept the logic of Lommel and enjoy an absurd journey. <br /> <br /> After much prolonging the claws of the tombs of the roads covered with straw. , zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly like they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup with an airbrush around their eyes. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his lucky compatriot Boll and injects large doses of European cheese. Trash techno on the soundtrack. We are talking about prehistoric electronic buzzer noises. Things that could have played in an Ibiza club when Lommel was still young enough to shake off his booty. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, the Lommel girls talk and function as normal ... er, I mean, as they did before they became zombified. This gives our author ample opportunities to bathe with more of his golden dialogue. Yes, it is a golden rain. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything by revealing the end of the crash. All I can say is that it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood is still alive ... or should I say his geist.
