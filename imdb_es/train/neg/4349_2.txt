This movie is terrible Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not, but it is one of the best crime movies ever made. This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or perhaps to Speed ​​Zone. Remember those gems! The only reason why this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult of the original. This film lacked everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard. There was not a nice character and that is the fault of all those responsible for doing it. I hope that RISE TO POWER will win as many RAZZIES as possible and maybe invent some new categories to allow it to be a record keeper. After watching this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat down and watched Carlitos's original way of removing the bad taste from my mouth. After seeing this, I wish Pachanga would come and take me out of my misery.
