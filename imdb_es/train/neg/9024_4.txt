"Shinobi" is one of those movies that thinks that the mere act of killing a character automatically generates a feeling of gravity or emotion in the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to really care about the people who die, you have to develop the characters, otherwise, all you have is a lot of random acts of violence. The problem is aggravated especially when you have TONS of characters, all of which die. <br /> <br /> Well, then, if you can not bother to make the characters memorable or understanding, at least you can make the reasons why they die plausible, right? No Here we have a war between two ninja clans, and neither side really knows WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. However, even long after it becomes clear that the emperor wants ALL to be dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness ... that's just silly. <br /> <br /> Good, good! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide a reasonable reason to fight. At least they die fighting in great action scenes, right? Once again, NO! In fact, many of the fights are not even fights: super ninjas that the film devoted so much time and effort to present death suddenly (and without conviction, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I'm walking and me- * the neck is cut off." * The end of that character.Not even in the middle of the movie, I raised my hands in frustration at the absurdity.
