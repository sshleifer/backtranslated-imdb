... and even then, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this movie (if one is called that) is of real interest only to slavery fanatics. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new (and I mean * nothing *), nor will they enjoy the warm fantasies of experiencing something familiar, loved or appreciated. <br /> <br /> It does not matter the abysmal script, the wood, theater performance less than community, the total absence of direction, the shit lighting or any of the other values ​​of production of the gangue basement. This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" Making films of the lowest order. I suppose one could be grateful that they at least knew how to operate the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of that is related to the reason why this is so resounding * wrong *. <br /> <br /> It's wrong because the young woman who plays Bettie Page, a zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of the Curves is the dark hair and the characteristic fringe, does not manage to contribute anything to the paper beyond the willingness to tie and gag. This is apparently good for his film career before and since this unfortunate excess, but not for the unfortunate excess in itself, which consists mainly of a number of black and white dramatizations carefully recreated between horribly frightening scenes of delimiting biographies that delineate The Mrs. . The page falls from grace (so to speak). There is probably more information, per se, about Page's life in the opening and closing credits than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a companion movie worthy of "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy movie at all. This is a fetish piece that is marketed in the appeal of one of the best pin-ups of all time, and does so without class, without style and without any real sense of understanding of the character of Bettie Page. No true Bettie Page fan will find anything but a disappointment, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If it's free, remember that time is money too. Maybe yours is not worth much, but I bet it's worth enough to regret losing time with this one. That's it, I'm finished, you've been warned.
