While this output certainly does not live up to its predecessor, it has more memorable moments. My personal favorite, right after ruining an apple of the city with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear falls from his left eye, we know at that moment that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can not help but feel trapped in his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat effect was no more than a facade. Absolute shine! The sex scenes show a good balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Afterwards, I felt that I had a good understanding of how to work with the Magnavision videodisc player. Pity they have not produced them in more than 25 years.
