This is one of the worst horror movies I've seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie aficionado and I'll rent any horror movie unless it's not made for television. When you look at the box, it says that it is classified as R for gore and some language ... Where was the gore? Was it your only good death scene where you really wear gore? I could have overlooked that if there had been a brief nude or a good dialogue. There was not a single witty or funny line in this boring movie. Sometimes, horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.
