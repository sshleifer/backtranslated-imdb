Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel cheated out of the rent money and sometimes, that's all you can ask for. The plot is good, nothing bright or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is beautiful. The direction is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the effects of werewolf, which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem. There was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which for me is pretty good, but it was not so good. In general, it's a pretty average movie for video, it's not the worst movie I've seen and if you get bored by a genre fan, take a look. I would even see him again. <br /> <br /> An extra piece of information for horror fans, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them) plays the werewolf.
