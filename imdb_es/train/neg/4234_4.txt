It's not the best-made slasher movie of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty funny. The plot is scarce but the deaths are not so bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the bands that appear in this movie, you will not find this movie as fun as those who do it. I met someone who saw this movie and was very disappointed by the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand what was done in the free time of being on tour, between touching the children and drinking with friends in the backstage. .. it is not meant to be taken seriously. It is ubber cheese in its best punk version and with more than 100 deaths, most of which are ultra bloody, it is a fun movie for friends to see, drink and be happy!
