The "Blue Desert" may have had the potential to be a plausible and more entertaining half-way thriller. The main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox), was not that stupid. When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, the cartoonist Roberts moves to a small town in the west. In his early days there, he meets the crazy suspect Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this part well), who eventually will not leave his side. Fearing for his safety after having been in the situation twice before, he establishes friendship and relationship with the suspiciously friendly town policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among the spectators who otherwise they should be convinced of the false leads thrown by the writers). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because, as he tells him, Atkins is an ex-convict and guilty of sexual assault. But, the police have lacked the evidence to remove him before. <br /> <br /> The film had enough tactics to at least make an interesting film because, very soon, there is so much confusion as to who Roberts should trust. However, much of the deliberate suspense seems too forced because the character of Roberts never seems to react to simple things as we believe any reasonable person could. And their late responses allow much of that suspense to occur easily and unconvincingly, particularly in the end. Maybe Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; Also the baby faced in ways that remember the personality of Kevin Anderson in his character of "Sleeping with the enemy". Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, this could also be enough. Meanwhile, the movie is not as good, even as a low budget thriller.
