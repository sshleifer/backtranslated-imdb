We rented five films for the end of the year weekend and saw it first. All I can say is that there was no place to go but to get up after seeing this one. It was useless and vulgar. The screenplay by Harvey Keitel must have been easy to write: just make two out of three words, a curse. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good at a character roll, but the movie has nothing more to recommend.
