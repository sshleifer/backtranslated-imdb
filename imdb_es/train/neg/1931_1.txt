I went to see this with a lot of expectation. Unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid and, in general, the film is far from inspiring fear or interest. Even a child can see the logic lacking in the behaviors of the characters. Children today need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them "daydream" about events. That is precisely what happened with films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children imagined becoming Jedi Knights and lighting their own lightsabers?) Seriously, do not waste your time and money on this.
