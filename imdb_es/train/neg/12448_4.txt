Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a company from the Wild West, one of the six regular misfits who make up a touring show that strives to break the balance. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but those women never last long, and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke, Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). It seems that Miss Lilly, as she calls it Doc (Scatman Crothers), is a possible heiress who will only receive the inheritance of her deceased father if she is married when she turns 30, so on the eve of that birthday she is attached to the Geoffrey Lewis cartoon. <br /> <br /> So, what is the plot of this movie? It is hard to say. There is romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that during the first half of the movie she is so insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes "one of the companies" in the middle of the movie, not only it's amazing, but the audience has already gone from worrying about it. There is a chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this theme is not treated enough to really be the raison d'Ãªtre of the film. There is the difficult situation of Miss Lilly to be stranded in the rural West, isolated from the funds that feed her ruined luxury life (her family and the press mistakenly believe she is dead). But are we really supposed to believe that she could not go back to New York and her fortune waiting if she gave it a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this movie seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a beloved group of losers who come together through thick and thin. This is a warm and fuzzy movie? Or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a weapon, even thwarting a bank robbery in a shootout that is grotesquely out of place in a film that is otherwise relatively nonviolent. One of the gangs is arrested for an old charge of draft evasion; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The show shop burns; An orphanage makes them a new one. But numerous worldly pitfalls do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> Aggravating the problem is acting, or lack of it. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is pretty amateur. Eastwood is also not at the top of his game, although he looks better simply because he is surrounded by such a lackluster group. <br /> <br /> And despite all this, the movie continues for 116 minutes. To what point Good question? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
