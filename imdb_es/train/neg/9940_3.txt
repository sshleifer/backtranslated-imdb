In the 60s, having as background the rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones? In addition to Marianne Faithful, Godard reveals other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements. Black power through the black panthers, feminism, communism, fascism, are intermingled with the reading of a political novel of cheap pulp divided into chapters: "The rocking of the stones;" Novel black exterior ";" View and sound ";" All About Eve ";" The Heart of Occident ";" Inside Black Syntax "and," Under the Stones the Beach ". <br /> <br />" Sympathy for the Devil "is another pretentious and boring mess of unequal director Jean-Luc Godard.The narrative and the scenes are horrible , but fortunately I love the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it's nice to see them at the beginning of their careers, otherwise, this documentary would be unbearable, the vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil) : "Sympathy for the devil"
