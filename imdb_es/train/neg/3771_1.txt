This has to be one of the worst movies of the nineties. When my friends and I were watching this movie (being the target audience to which it was directed) we just sat down and saw the first half hour with the jaws touching the ground because of how bad it was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater started talking to each other, usually leaving or yelling at their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earned working to see this weak excuse for a movie. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but in the movie it seems that no one in the movie has a clue as to what's going on. Fucking acting, fucking costumes. I can not express how embarrassing it is to look at this. Save yourself an hour and a little of your life .........
