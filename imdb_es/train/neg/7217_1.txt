I just watched this DVD at home. We love Westerners, so my husband rented it. He started to apologize halfway. The mounts, the suits, the accents, everything was off. The part that made me angry is that the boy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow while carrying the soul of the fat man. His only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left". We saw it all the time, and, as someone else said ... too many bad things to stand out for some reason why it stunk. I mean, the fact that the boy snatched the evil stone from the collector the same month and day he found himself, what's the point of that? And why was there a tomb courtyard where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still walking? If you want to make fun of a movie after a few beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want a true western, you will hate this movie.
