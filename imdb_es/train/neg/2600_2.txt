Here we have a film that fails in almost all aspects, it is possible that a film fails. Terrible script, bad acting, amateur direction, funny special effects ... it's an absolutely horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you will realize that all this does not make any sense. After spending the whole movie wondering what is going on here when things are finally explained, you realize that the story has been built on a basis that is ridiculously impossible. In one of those horrible sequences of "villains that explain the whole movie" we are told that our villain has done something that simply can not be done and that does not make any sense at all. Oh, and after that we see that there also seems to be some kind of gelatin monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to pretend that this movie never happened. If for some ungodly reason, you are ever tempted to sit and watch this movie, I suggest you take that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage.
