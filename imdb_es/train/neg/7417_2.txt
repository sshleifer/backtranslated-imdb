This movie is so bad: dialogues, stories, actors and actresses, everything! - It is hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or in the following years. "Love's Brother" (set in Australia among Italian immigrants) has only small clich√©s about the Italian culture it offers, and it is quite telling that even Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film: ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people, it is really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good at movies like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Garbage as a garbage man!
