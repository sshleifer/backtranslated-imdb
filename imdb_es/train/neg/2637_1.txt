Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It is as if someone had given a budget of billions of dollars to an autistic student of the third grade and said "make me a movie about the secret service". The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random, in the best of cases, every syllable of dialogue was completely delayed and the address ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was so useless and lame and useless ... and random ... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will also enjoy it; Deterrance, dark blue and a partial frontal lobotomy.
