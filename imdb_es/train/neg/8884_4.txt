"Dominique" is one of those films in which the expression "slow like molasses" must have been invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano?). CASI is redeemed at the end by a surprising turn, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second turn that only manages to leave a bad taste in our mouths. It is not a very nice movie.
