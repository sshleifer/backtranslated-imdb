As a former diver, this was one of the worst underwater movies I've seen. First, a riot on board any US naval vessel. UU., Particularly a Trident submarine of nuclear power, is unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is impressive and they take it very seriously from the Captain to the youngest crew member. I could never see a crew of a ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington, would be relieved of his duties and Martial Court, after the Navy. No wonder the Navy has refused to send a technical adviser to help in the making of this film. Finally, if any member of the crew of a submarine made the amount of noise that was being made on this ship, he would be reprimanded severely. The submarines learn early in their race to be as calm as possible to avoid detection. They do not close doors and even speak quietly and wear soft-soled shoes when they are on the road. I was surprised at how strong they represented the crew while they were on the move. High music would never be tolerated. I know that portraying underwater life would not really sell movie tickets, but this is exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
