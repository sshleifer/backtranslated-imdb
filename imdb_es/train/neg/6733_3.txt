The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, although it is a euphemism. This film not only cries, but screams loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made sharp, humorless suspense thrillers who fought for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they filmed in real places in New York with a tiny "real life" acoustics to increase the likelihood. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the dialogue of disorder of the Stones and the histrionics of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a presentation completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics. the genius James Mason (emaciated and bored); Both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger (with a bloated and bored look) and his skinny cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason has helped build without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Here is another credibility problem. example of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, but foolish enough to hire a degenerate drug addict as a subordinate. The Stones' idea of ​​nail biting stress is to catch the hysterical Stevens alone with rapist Neville Brand, who fills the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. But the work of the camera is so tedious and the mark is so (uncharacteristic) that the effect is not rough, much less suspense. The Stones, a square couple of hearts, do not even have the courage of their own lack of convictions. <br /> <br /> The movie, which ends with the corpulent Steiger chasing Stevens' fleet in an underground train. The clue is as clumsy as it is heavily ungainly. With Angie Dickinson as the loving girlfriend of Steiger, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
