This short parody can be found on the DVD Elite's Millennium Edition of "Night of the Living Dead." Thank God I would never have gone out of my way to see it. Replace the zombies with bread sounds like a silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, it is a different matter. This short did not even make me giggle. I never really thought I would say this, but "Dawn of the Day of the Dawn of the Bride of the Bride of the Revenge of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of Evil, Mutant, Foreigner, Eat Meat, Attacked by Hell, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D "was a VERY BETTER parody and not so boring or boring. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
