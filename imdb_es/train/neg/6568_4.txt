It's funny that the two stars of Meet The People were a couple of movie stars who entered the new medium of television and became even bigger hits, and that both entered the end of production and enjoyed the status of tycoon on the small screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not an important star, which would come with television. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to get out of making movies like Meet The People and his career would be the salvation of his next movie. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the movie was because a young MGM player received a special number and he was watching it at that time. Her private time with June Allyson was much better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks bored and can not evoke any kind of emotion. <br /> <br /> I was probably tired of making these musicals with absurd plots, the kind that fled Warner Brothers. The original program Meet The People was not a book program, it was a magazine and it was developed in the 1940-41 season on Broadway for 160 presentations. When MGM bought it, they rejected everything except the title and the title song. The rest of the score was patched by various and diverse composers, none of the songs is memorable. Rare when you consider that part of the source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys simply must have emptied the trunk by the material. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupider than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the author of a magazine called Meet The People and is a shipyard worker who wins a lottery appointment with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, both are interested in the magazine, but the creative differences keep them separate, of course, until the end. In summary, that is the movie. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball some good musical acts that are the main reason to see Meet The People. The great bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr, dressed in a commodore suit like the one Lou Costello had in the sequence of dreams in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number of The Wizard Of Oz. And since almost everyone in the world has seen that movie, you have an idea that Heave Ho is like. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next movie was Murder My Sweet, in which he finally offered a not-so-good-bye to musicals And Lucy would have to wait for television before the world could see what it could really do.
