The Lady in Cement is a true social anthropology course of the late sixties. Writing, not acting, is at the center of the stage. I said - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are a woman or gay.

Surprising to note that both were 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score, wait. . . Was there a score? Well, you understand the point. Look at it with friends who want a good laugh. is full of them
