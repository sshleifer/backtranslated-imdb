This film is essentially about the arch-anemic Dr. Claw of Inspector Gadget, who returned after many years to the now peaceful city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to frustrate Gadget once and for all by using a new "cooler" to combat the popularity of Gadget. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it is no longer enough; Dr. Claw is not only visually less frightening, but sounds more like a fighter with a cold, than his original intimidation. Granted, this is a movie for children, but the plot is so faintly painful (I can not mention the animation) that it pales in comparison to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny and update her two decades, now she has a style of quasi-punk rebel clothing and does not play half the role she did in the television series. The Gadgetmobile speaks, in addition to including an angle of the plot that focuses on the talking cars of ON. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the program that has grown weary, but I thought the live action version was more pain than I could handle, but now they go and sprout from this quality television series. we. It's more than I can take.
