The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. History is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 70s. The issue was not credible for 2007, it was not even established in DC. I think this became a reality for everyone who saw it, because the applause was low and fast at the end. Most did not stay for the questions and answers either. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought that the movie was anticipated. Many of the scenes seemed to be short as if they had never ended or I just did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and had to try to find out or guess what was happening. I did not really get the private life or the boyfriend of Woody (Carter) either. What were all the images of "artistic" bondage and torture (of Iraq's prisons) about? What was I thinking? I think it was his very bad attempt to try to create this dark life of private subculture for the character of Woody (Car). It did not work. It did not even seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) without problems. He really understood how he could have been a "walker" (for example, twenty years ago). It was great and most likely never to be recognized. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Bored. <br /> <br /> I do not see it! It is painful! Unless you're a true Harrelson fan.
