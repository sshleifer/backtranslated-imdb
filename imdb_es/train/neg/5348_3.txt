Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic reduction / expansion machine to the Smithsonian Institution while he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) prepare for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall ). Wayne's brother, Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and their children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to care for Adam while their parents are away, but as luck he would have it (and the title would lead him to wait), the adults are accidentally hit by Wayne's shrunken beam. As children go crazy, their miniature people must deal with monstrously large insects, carpet wrinkles that look like cannons and other threats to them. This was bad, like most of the direct video sequels, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of ridiculous. I had to laugh at the movie "Roach" by Stuart Pankin and the party thugs were even more ridiculous, at your own risk!
