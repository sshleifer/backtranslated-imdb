This film competes with "Plan 9" as one of the dumbest movies ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did the 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western "tricks". So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just ONE example from the movie: in the movie the sheriff has to take a witness to another city to protect himself. Of course, the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. What's going on? The good ones are riding and a shot sounds and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys, everyone is sitting on a register, chatting. What's wrong with this image? <br /> <br /> I could go on. Maybe this movie was thought of as a comedy. If so, he did not do well either.
