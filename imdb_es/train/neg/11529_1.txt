Yes, unfortunately, I found the DVD of this and discovered that it was incredibly horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters stink. I mean, come on, if an idiot with an orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could have for a character, then they definitely should not be in the movie scene. Poor "disguises", bad "interviews", and basically there is not a "fighter" in this whole album with any fragment of charisma. <br /> <br /> The "fight" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these The idiots bounce gently and playfully on a trampoline. They also make sure they laugh together all the time, making the experience look more like a game of small children than a "deadly fight". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty dull clone of Backyard Wrestling. Only, instead of blood, weapons, chaos and STRUGGLE, we get a trampoline, smiling kids, TERRIBLE audio and a guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It is awful.
