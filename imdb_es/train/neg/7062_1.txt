All right, it's not possible, honestly, the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> This did not make any sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no action, only nothing. <br /> <br /> this is what I thought when I saw it for the first time on May 28, 2003 ** caution, this is a spoiler alert. I'm also complaining about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> Ok, so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there's no explanation of the characters. As far as I knew, the main character was new at this school, but apparently not. he also seemed to live alone ... after he was a foster child ... after his mother was a furious alcoholic who still lived with him. In addition, all his friends apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a main point of the plot, this madman has escaped from the asylum and is running rampant. Now our main character is obsessed with this boy and focuses intensely on him for the contingency of the film. I think I must have lost a main element of the plot here, there was no REASON for the main character to get hooked. Even if that is the point, without reason, why do all his friends, who are skeptical like 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants? <br /> <br /> so that the movie continues, and everything goes well. They are wreaking havoc at school, blah, blah, blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the 'show' here. Wait a second, did not the madman specifically tell the main character NOT to do that? It was supposed to be anomalous. <br /> <br /> Oh, another important element of the plot has been skipped ... the crazy man was not supposed to be crazy ... everyone said he was not crazy. but as the story continues, he is VERY CLEARLY OUT OF HIS MIND. but I thought the news said that I was not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now that the movie is coming to an end. What was the closure? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? Not only the ending did not answer any questions about the main character, but he did not answer any questions about the madman. Are these people in the same situation? If so, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this. If not, then what is the point of saying "are you in two weeks"? ?? <br /> <br /> * end of thing ... * <br /> <br /> that's what I thought then. That is more or less what I still think now. 6 months have passed, and if I can get it for free, I could give it another chance, but I doubt it. I really doubt it.
