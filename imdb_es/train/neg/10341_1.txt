I rented this movie from the library (it's hard to find for a good reason) just out of curiosity. I'm a big fan of Plath and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The script is horrible, not because it deviates from the original text of the novel, but because it deviates without focus or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not take the viewer anywhere. What about the cheerful voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazaro has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely amazing as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 year old) in part due to the casting (she was 32 years old during filming, how old Plath was when she died) and partly due to the fact that she can not act. Hassett is all emotion, not art, not skill. The address is mediocre; the director simply covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is because 0 is not an option. I'm sorry, Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your excellent work to something more appropriate.
