I have a copy of this on VHS, I think they (the television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So that we do not forget what it was and remember not to make the same mistakes again. How to put some people in the director's chair, where they do not belong. This Rappin 'movie is like a Vaudevillian musical, for those who can not sing or act. This movie is as fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive an urban bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of jail and goes to the old neighborhood. In time of service for a crime of all-a-nice necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by the children dogs, the older ladies and their companions, as they dance and sing along the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if it was sentimental, or if it were true. someone was smoking a medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Anyway, it is a satire of the life of the ghetto badly directed, with script, acted and even produced (I never thought I had sat like that) with the 'hood'. Although, I believe that the redeeming part of the story, through gang fight sequences and dance numbers, their friends care about their neighbors and want to prevent the ghetto from being demolished and cleaned up. <br /> <br /> Forget about Sonny's spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for that compared to this Rap. Oh, well, if you feel like laughing silly and embarrassed three quarters, make sure you drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, watch responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
