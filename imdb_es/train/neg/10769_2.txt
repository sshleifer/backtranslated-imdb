I found this on the shelf while I was at home and bored. How can people possibly give this a 10? It's not just that it's supposed to be a redemption movie to feel good (I think), because it does not work at that level either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible performance; There is simply nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are simply terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) does not make sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to follow a certain path and to do it, without actually writing the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life that you'll never come back.
