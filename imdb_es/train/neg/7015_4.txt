"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s: the meeting place for the social elite and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on a real studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that everything is brightness and style, and not substance. It tries to be a really dirty satire like "Boogie Nights", but ultimately it appears as an inferior contender. Mike Myers receives the unpleasant task of playing the owner of the club that inhales cocaine, Steve Rubell. It's just a slightly comical role and if this was Myers' best attempt to slip into the drama like Lemmon and other comic actors did in his day, it's a total failure. interesting, but instead, it's just another silly teen movie that is not entertaining or even remote. See at your own risk.
