The creators of this film have created a future in which not only abortion and birth control are illegal in all states, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent to serve long terms of imprisonment. In other words, this movie is the worst nightmare of the liberals! The political agenda is so complicated here and the style of the film is so discreet that it simply loses strength quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, I recommend you skip it.
