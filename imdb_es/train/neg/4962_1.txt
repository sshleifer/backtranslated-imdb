99.999% pure garbage. And the other .001% was a brief moment in which I thought that the blonde girl was going to undress. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action stank, and there was no sex (the aforementioned blonde girl is modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've seen in a movie, and the anachronisms were numerous and obvious. The performance was mediocre even by Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen high school works with higher production capacity. This is the kind of movie in which MST3K thrived. The heads must roll in Sci-Fi to allow this pile of steam to air.
