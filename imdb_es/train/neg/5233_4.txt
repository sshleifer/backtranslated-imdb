Quite awful but observable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you've lived until 80). Veterans of Vietnam fight together as friends against injustice in the United States. Team A meets the Desire of Death, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, the soldiers go home and, years later, a friend is in trouble. No, wait, in fact, the friend is dead and it is his father who is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely horrible meat tenderizer (super pointy) as he tries to defend his father's little shop from the local "protection" gang despite being in a wheelchair outside the war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's old unit in Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the screeching wheel gets greasy, and the old gang mounts the chair. Through the city You can almost imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning and how they are really good at what they do. when they plan in advance But Joey would not have been put in a wheelchair for a shot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit had not been playing! Then, when things go really well in the city while fighting gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely omit their plan and try to catch the gang without everyone present. Phh !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Silly! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment in which all current members of the unit make sure to test the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it is real. Each one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep watching, I suppose. The movie is not too horrible to watch, but it's a joke. There are all these climatic moments in which nothing really ends. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie: the explosives in Vietnam, the battle of Joey's death and the gang that brutally kicks an innocent teddy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I suppose my main problem with this movie is that I feel disappointed about it. Even the confused subplots with "mysterious helpers" and their strange cross-purpose motives were not enough to save him in the end. But someday maybe everything goes well and they will make a sequel. LOL !!!
