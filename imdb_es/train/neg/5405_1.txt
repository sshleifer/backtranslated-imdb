['I got this as a movie from Turkey and I was not disappointed. <br /><br /> Acting: in general, although many have been in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to act so consistently throughout this film without accidentally neglecting some degree of performance. <br /><br /> Argument: being generous, I can say that the scriptwriter originally started with an argument but did everything possible to ignore it. The plot broke faster than a Chinese computer <br /><br /> Scrip - now that it was an abomination of nature. He failed to flow with some rhyme or reason. most of the lines of the characters were, at best, pathetic for imbeciles. the script worked hard to make sure no character managed to be considered memorable. I have seen other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /><br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were special bus shorts. <br /><br /> Direct: until you can create your own directing ability, copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you will only make mistakes like this one. <br /><br /> It&#39;s good to know that your friends / family have awarded you 10 stars for this movie.']
