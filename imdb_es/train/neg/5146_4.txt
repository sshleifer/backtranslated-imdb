For a long time I expected to see this movie, here in Latin America or any oriental movie has no distribution in theaters, we can find some of those movies in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I expected something. Well, but the only good thing about this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, just stupid, with many useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time even writing about this movie. I'm sorry but it's the truth.
