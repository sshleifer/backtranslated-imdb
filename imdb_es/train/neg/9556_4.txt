This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects. He is very weak in the plot. Most of the computer talk was just mumbo-jumbo. I saw him because he was a big fan of the original War Games movie, which was based mostly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie did not have any of that. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and unrealistic for computers and real networks, but they were also unconvincing. It's as if it was written by someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was scarce and was essentially just an arcade game. There is no real piracy, what was the point? The movie was boring. Lame sequel.
