This has to be the worst, and I mean the worst motorcyclist movie ever made! And that says a lot because the stink line is long and stinks! <br /> <br /> Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan Island! A scared Tina Louise (she was probably afraid that someone would see this mess!) She is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in movie history. But, do not worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a Hick-Town doctor comes to the rescue. Pow! Smash! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some laughing fight scenes and the still "sexy" Tina Louise!
