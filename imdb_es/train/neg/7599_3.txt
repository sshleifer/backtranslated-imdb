A friend told me about John Fante last summer after talking about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski, an author with a similar touch and humor, except for a previous generation. "Ask the Dust" was the first Fante book I read, and it's still one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant article about a young writer, sad and scared, who was posing as himself and for the outside world as an author with a great deal of confidence and a great talent who had no idea how to write about experiences of the real world from which I had nothing. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, without the slightest idea of ​​how to win the thanks of women who desperately want to write in magazines. The story of her strange relationship with Camilla, how she conforms to her first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how she finally runs out of nothing but the story of her failed attempts at love is scathing and real, without touching Hollywood. ending. The film adaptation remains true to the book for a while, but it snakes its way through the cinematic trap of love that perseveres through racism, disease and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is an imbecile and that Camilla is going crazy, and that her love was never and never would be real, no matter how much they wanted to find each other. This movie tore the real meaning of the story and replaced it with Schlock. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a film about that he did it so badly.
