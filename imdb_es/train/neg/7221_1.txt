.... CAUSE IS CRAP! The kind of movie that makes you want to go hit the filmmaker and say "WHY?". Horrible work with the camera ... count how many times the camera tries to remain stable in one person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comical. It seems they took a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie with as little money as possible. I would bet $ 10 that they used video cameras to do this. Either that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you ever want to organize a "Party of the worst movie", bring this one. Do you want more entertainment ... look at a wall.
