Well, I rented this movie and found out that it really sucks. It's about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family, then the great son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a picture of the damaged building, weird things and weird movies, and then asks his father to Do it. Take it to a side trip and simply accept, etc etc etc ... They go to that city that no one knows exists (blah, blah, blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and, however, I do not understand what ESA is MOVIE !!!! I have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst, I honestly do not have a description and I wish I had not seen it.
