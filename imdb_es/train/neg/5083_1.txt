I find it rather pointless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that has nothing good to show the world extract because of the fact that it is rotten like another endless one. number of eggs has been in front of her. But since a comment is obligatory for such a great insignificance ... <br /> <br /> It is definitely the right word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie that insists to represent the so-called "Romanian reality" after the communist era (1990 to present). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances is it recommended for people outside Romania as for the others (who lately find amateur camera, lack of argument). , the lack of quality of the directors / actors, etc., the noise, etc., since it is modern and even artistic: observe and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but do the other members a favor of well-intentioned IMDb, do not write a review online because it will deviate, irritate and, in the end, waste your time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among others) has some value, an educational one, since it gives the example for: "How NOT to make a film".
