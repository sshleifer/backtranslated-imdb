Yes, I have described this movie as a horrible star. However, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies onwards. This really is so bad that it is good. This is another K.Gordon Murray production (read: buy a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spend zero money on dubbing it into English and release it in children's matin√©es in the mid-1960s). It's a pity that I found this so late. I am sure that some "mood enhancers" would make this an even better experience. I will not repeat what many of the other critics have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the devil, the mechanical reindeer and some of the most pathetic children actors I have ever seen. I plan to do this during the holidays with "A Christmas Carol" by Kelsey Grammar. Truly a vacation experience made in hell. Now, if I can only find "To All A Goodnight (also known as Slayride)" on the DVD, I'll have a triple function that can not be beat. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I challenge you not to touch the fast forward button, especially in the two dance routines! This thing reeks of an expensive blue cheese, I guess you have to get over the stench to enjoy the experience. Happy Christmas friends!
