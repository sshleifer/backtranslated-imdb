This is the first time I write a comment about a movie in IMDb. But I had to write it for this. His 3 hours of unadulterated torture. From the beginning, you have the idea that the movie is going to be bad. The acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in Bhagat Singh) but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow the fear is missing. Prashant Raj is not an actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. I have no idea why the director took her in this movie. The background score is repetitive. I somehow felt that Ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it did not work. PLEASE do not see it
