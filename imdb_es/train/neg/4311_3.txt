I saw this movie when I was a young man full of furious hormones and it was a movie as sexy as I had ever seen, or was ever watching. It may not have been a great movie. My guess is that it was not. I do not really remember much about it, to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in ANY movie has done it for me as the incredibly sexy Cathy did in this movie. I have not seen it since the first time I saw it on television in the 70s and I do not think I'd like to see it again because I'm sure it would be a disappointment. My hormones are not so furious. And I've become more tired over the years. However, when I think about the shower scene, I can still remember how good it felt when. <br /> <br /> Added later: after watching the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home. What was once erotic now is quite docile. The oldest man and young woman thing still works for me, but not as much as before, probably because I am no longer a 12 year old child. That older woman is now younger than me. Also, the amateur attitude of all this was not perceived by my twelve year old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: sometimes it is better not to revisit the past.
