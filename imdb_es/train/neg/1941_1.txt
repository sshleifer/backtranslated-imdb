I can not believe I wasted five hours of my life on this garbage. The previous five-day offer by this author was very nice and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit since she murmured or muttered her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to the productions before broadcasting them to ensure that the dialogue is audible? As a result, I suppose I lost track of what was happening, and as the line of the original plot seemed to metamorphose into the standard thing of them and us among the Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax. A complete failure.
