What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of clich√©s I've seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a strong drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was horrible as always. How many expressions of pain and torture can a person have? The talents of Aidan Quinn were, as often, totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? Trying to be politically correct, this film still imposes racial stereotypes. (The brave and inexperienced solitary music teacher teaches poor children violin in a poor neighborhood school). The children were not even cute! He just wrote to adapt to the atrocious script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me shiver for once. Real horror this one!
