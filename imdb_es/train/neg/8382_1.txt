There was a Bugs Bunny caricature titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" that was EXACTLY in this plot. Finster with a baby face stole a bank and the money in the carriage pulled away and fell into Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed as a baby to get into Bugg's hole and get his money back. The scene in "Little Man", in which you look in the mirror of the bathroom shaving with a cigar in your mouth, is directly from the caricature. This was a hilarious caricature of 5 minutes; Not so much a whole movie. If you're really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original the first time (1954). In addition, you will get many more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to start!
