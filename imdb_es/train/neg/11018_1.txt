I bought this video at a fairly low price, thinking that the cover looked pretty good. And it was fine, but the movie is garbage. I can handle grade B, sometimes I even enjoy a good B romp (ie, 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just tasteless. The incredibly boring scenes were divided very sparingly by good healthy and entertaining pornography and dreamy horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
