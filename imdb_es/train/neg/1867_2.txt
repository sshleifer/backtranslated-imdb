Unfortunately, the only problem in this review is that there is nothing to spoil that movie. Even if B. Mattei had never done a masterpiece that he used to do his job with a little humor and madness that made him a fun director of Eurotrash. But for the past 10 years he seemed to have lost it. This movie is empty, there is nothing at all that awakens us from the deep sleep in which you sink after the first 10 minutes. There's no sex, no blood (it's supposed to be about Snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than his latest epics of cannibals and zombies. So, rest in peace, Bruno, you will remain in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombie 3, Robowar, Rats, Hellfire, Virus, Cruel Jaws and some more. So, except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by the new movie of the spirit of Jess Franco, transmit it. But if you do not have it. I know that this craftsman's good career tracks his old movies and you have fun.
