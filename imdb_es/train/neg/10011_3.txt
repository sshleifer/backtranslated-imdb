This film is about a male companion involved in a murder investigation that occurred in the circle of wives of powerful men. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and attractive, but I was so wrong. The rhythm is painful and extremely slow, because even after 40 minutes of the movie nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed in ten minutes. That is how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that it lacks emotions or scenes of action aggravates boredom. It is almost shocking that even the discussion scenes are so simple and devoid of emotion. Maybe it's because of the rigid upper lip of the highest social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame the bad plot and even at a worse rate.
