From a poorly conceived plot that has almost no sense, to a bad dialogue and disconnected scenes, to the last disappointment, the bad performance (even Peter Falk can not find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better to leave it lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance has no depth or emotion, like her castmates, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as a love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad, Noah, is almost unbearable to see, let alone listen to the song. But who can blame them with material like this. The screenplay by Michael J. Murray is juvenile at best. <br /> <br /> Every year, at this moment, I search the TV guides and I look forward to some of the truly inspirational and classic Christmas movies appearing on the small screen. Movies like "Miracle on 34th Street", the charming "The shop around the corner" by Ernst Lubitsch and, of course, the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There are Frank Capra's classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe." Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and an excellent performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is in the form of advice. Your time would be better spent looking for these movies than finding "Looking for John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
