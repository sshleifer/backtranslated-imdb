I have seen many stupid plots in my time, but this is one of the worst. After contracting some disease in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he goes crazy, killing people (how he overcomes me, I only see them, I can not explain them). This is the kind of movie that should not have been made in the first place.
