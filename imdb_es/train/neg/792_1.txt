Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving home, talking to new people and had the overwhelming feeling that people hated me. However, after watching an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my luck began to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I felt talented. When the series was over, I ran the sales department at work, beat a lot of women and often won the karaoke competition at my store. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and do not know where to turn, take a trip to Poundland and pick up the DVD, it only costs 99p.
