Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat and boring movie. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one of those who punished me by watching one terrible movie after another. I do not know, I think I needed a hobby during my adolescence. A marginalized teenager (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an old mirror. Soon, she learns about the horrible power that this ancient mirror has and uses it to attack those who have offended her. Movies like these, the one that gives power has an unpleasant side effect. It changes it inside and out, whether you like it or not. <br /> <br /> The disorder of a movie that for some reason was restored in d.v.d. A few years ago. I do not know why They should have left it on the shelf and picked up the dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you do, I'd like to know why. Until then I do not like this movie and I have no reason to see it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
