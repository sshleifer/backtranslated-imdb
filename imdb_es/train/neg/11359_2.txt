While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the program) worked well, most of the other elements faded away. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it will be in 3D, so we do not have to work so hard on the plot or the development of the character". And the fact that it's a children's movie is no excuse. The public is attracted to the three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) as well as the three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that any of the main characters showed was a two-dimensional Scooter that twists the plot from time to time with its compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the end (after seeing a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and ruins the good moment of all by calling "pollutants" the main characters of the movie and announce that the situation on the screen was actually an impossibility. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you want to tell the children that the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you're at it?
