This movie is just bad. Weak story, weak direction and performance below average. What really irritated me was the blatant publicity, constantly, for a known Internet provider. It is obvious that some scenes are written to do just that, advertising. This movie is a slap to anyone who has paid money for this. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this, it's not worth your time.
