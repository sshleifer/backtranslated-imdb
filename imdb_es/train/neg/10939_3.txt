This movie has one of the worst performances I've seen! Some scenes are original, like the nails that come on the floor. This nail trap catches these bad guys. The rest of the movie degrades as you go. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the 100 most important films of all time. I can not believe there are sequels either! The next fucking movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
