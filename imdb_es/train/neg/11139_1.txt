There's not much to say about this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting and the dialogue are far from being even decent, the history of the hybrid werewolf is not very well explained and all this has plot holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not want to see. He is so amateurish that he makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the Extras. The reel of the gag. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope no one buys this, it's not even worth it to rent it. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
