I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been cruel <br /> <br /> (to say the least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible Badly acted <br /> <br />, an ingenious script, with the direction of a cack ... See this movie was <br /> <br /> like watching a car accident: you want to look towards another side but you keep looking <br /> <br /> because you want to see how complicated it is going to be. Well, the car is <br /> <br /> destroyed and there are no survivors. On the positive side, the photograph <br /> <br /> was nice, it made me want to go on vacation, if only to cleanse myself of <br /> <br /> this profane
