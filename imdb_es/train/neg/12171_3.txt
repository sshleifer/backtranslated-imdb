Being a slasher movie buff, I will usually settle in to see every slash movie that goes through my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I will say. While navigating the canal the other night, Sleepaway Camp II crossed paths with me. Of course, I wanted to prove it, since I had heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but in reality I've never seen them (out of embarrassment, I know). I will observe that, since I have not seen the original, my criticism probably should not be taken seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong is totally intentional because of the design of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Now I guess the Sleepaway Camp franchise is, in itself, a joke about itself. Hell, even the name appears as an intentional joke. Outdoor camp? It's a lot of fun I can appreciate the movie for wanting to simply put something together for pure camp horror value, but that's all I can get. The performance in this film made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like the actors who play Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but let's go. Pamela Springsteen, like the evil assassin without contact with reality, did a better job to eliminate my interest than her by killing the entire cast. As for the comedy, there were times when I chuckled, but they were few. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really wanted to sleep away from the camp. The deaths are so obviously organized and false that they can hardly be appreciated. If you are looking for a comedy slasher with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your navigation through the channel takes you through it, check and see what else there is.
