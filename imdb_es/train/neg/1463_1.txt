Imagine that the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been as foolish as Carlyle portrayed him in this movie. <br /> <br /> No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed one. Boy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a piece of Hollywood card advertising, disguised as "real story". <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to everyone who really believed something about this show. Carlyle and the producers did not understand anything well with this. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we were a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? When interpreted as a loser, they make their own totally incredible movie. This movie is a mixture of the old propaganda of World War II and the urban myths of MTV about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunk for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame and I wonder how they could convince an actor like Carlyle in this dreck.
