This movie is so bad it hurts. The car has a speed of 30 mph when it is supposed to go to 100 ... the gearshift that is stuck (in Park!), The nurse who drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on his shoulder ... Can not any of the 2 imbeciles take this damn phone? There is nothing credible about this shit. I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this!
