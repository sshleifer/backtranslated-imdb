Terrible. Only horrible The script is designed, the performance is painful and the story is prolonged. It is, without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. This would not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and protagonist of the film, and so is self-glorification. I realized that I did not care about the romance that was developing between the two main characters, and the ending did not come too soon. It has two redeeming characteristics. The first thing is that many of the shots are really lovely, especially in Paris, and they look pretty good in black and white. Secondly, whether you're a fan of tango or not, music is, in general, excellent (except when Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need an involuntary laugh. I'm sure it attracts someone. Statistically, you have to do it.
