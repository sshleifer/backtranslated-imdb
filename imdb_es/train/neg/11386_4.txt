One of those documentaries of "Gracias a Dios no vivo". This speaks of two factions at war in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the towns around Medell√≠n. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death run rampant. The boys, who are not more than 22 years old, not in the middle of a war, are in jail. The girls ?? no women, girls? Always react in the same way when one of them dies, with tears and screams. You scratch your head; What did they expect, really? I do not know what is more disturbing: the nightly shootings and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer, what is it, 10? If you had to take these young men out of their situation and place them somewhere where they had the opportunity to do more, be more, how many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
