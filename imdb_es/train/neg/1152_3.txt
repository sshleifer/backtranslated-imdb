I understand what this movie was trying to portray. How the ancients are often ignored and treated as a nuisance, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I do not have a problem with this message, but I feel I could have been exposed in a way that is not so painful to watch. I enjoy a good art movie, but when a movie becomes too ariaca (as in this case), the result is usually frustrating. Including the shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly, which takes 5 minutes, tries to make a point, but ends up bothering the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull together. This is a movie that you feel you should enjoy or qualify high and it certainly has its merits, but I was too frustrated to see it to recommend it to someone else. You may have a deeper message than Roger Michell's other films (for example, 'Notting Hill'), but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching.
