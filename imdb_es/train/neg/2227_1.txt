Every once in a while, someone out of nowhere glances at me and asks "What's wrong with SNITCH'D"? I know that they immediately have a case of barely concealed fun + horror. You see, I was the director of photography for the film. <br /> <br /> Allow me to clarify some points about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, a day after I finished TRIANGLE SQUARE, a small 35mm great feature that, like so many independent features of the time, was never distributed despite the festival's praise ... He was the eternal victim of the small print of SAG. Notorious Experimental Feature Contract. But I'm rambling ... <br /> <br /> I thought I was on a roll, and when James asked me to film his little gangster on 16 mm with a shooting budget of approximately $ 25,000, I did not want to break the rhythm , he took it After all, CLERKS, THE MARIACHI ... I also believed the myth back then. <br /> <br /> We only consider it "film school" for many involved, including myself. SNITCH'D was shot for two weeks in August 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a high school in the latter city (yes, he is a Drama and English teacher ... consider THIS while watching the movie, or even observe the use of apostrophe in the title), hence the locations and the distribution. <Br /> <br /> The only known dramatic appearance of the LA 2 Morning News climate girl from Vera, Vera Jim√©nez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived Hollywood and it was like I wanted like me to get a movie under his belt. I must say that his professional dedication, his focus and his "let's do it" attitude kept me inspired and was a harbinger of his stardom to come. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom du jour operators, and the delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that eclipses the actual content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the year 2003, the film was sold to distributors (at a net loss, I understand) who inexplicably did not have pictures of Eva in the box (by then she was a rising name) ), but he managed to get a clear picture of what appears to be a true Latino gangster to give SNITCH'D credibility. Since the other passion of Cahill is the exchange of old books, it seems to confirm that he believes that he can, in fact, judge a book by its cover ... since many have collected this DVD based on its cover. -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ A year later, Eva, now with a soap, and one day I met James to filming a simple short film I had prepared, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite the intent of the festival. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie called JUAREZ, Mexico. I thought I had solved the process; my participation depended on the casting, the script and the control of the crew, and the resulting film actually looked promising in the newspapers, so it was ... a story about cheap detectives around the mass murders of girls in Juarez ; Despite the claims here and elsewhere, the film NEVER appeared at any festival or location, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has distribution and simply awaited its release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio images about the Same theme, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and CITY OF LA FRONTERA.
