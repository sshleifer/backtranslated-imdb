<br /> <br /> This movie sucks big. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is, in every way, an even poorer movie. <br /> <br /> The only good one in the cast that does something for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great ladies of the history of European cinema. I loved his manic looks in "Suspiria" and "hell" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I will say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to sleep very fast ...
