If I had not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never have suspected that this rather garish and outdated musical was made by a man so intimately associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, I wonder if in the 50s and 60s, the New Wave authors hated this kind of movie, it's so ... so ... unreal. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just something very surprising. <br /> <br /> What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise that some of the critics gave to this movie, especially when there are so many. There are many better French musicals out there. The songs in this movie simply were not particularly interesting and all the characters seemed so bland and stereotyped. If I had to see another rich person who cared about how difficult it is to be rich or get a good sale price with a designer suit, I was going to throw up. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that, as American musicals, not all French musicals are gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN) and, despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I do not see many reasons to recommend it as something more than a strange rarity.
