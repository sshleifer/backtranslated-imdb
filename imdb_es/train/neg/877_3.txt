I was thrilled to see this film waiting for it to be the sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons," which portrays the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has NOTHING to do with the title I mention. It's just a soft core Cinemax movie that will not make a change in your life. There's only one hot sex scene on a rooftop, but that's it. I saw it a long time ago, but believe me, this is just a boring regular and boring movie. <br /> <br /> Women are attractive, but that is not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to look at this only if it is transmitted by cable.
