This movie seems to be a scam of many movies that dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. The director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin continues to reappear in the movies, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is that directors and producers love his unusual ridiculous looks, complemented by that strange hairstyle that looks in the most of his movies. The only good movie in which he has appeared is "The Squid and the Whale", in which he only speaks two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, her protagonist, does not fare much better; There is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie that will be under the risk of the spectator.
