All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to see this movie (although they are only allowed at 18). They've heard it's a very scary movie and they feel great when they see it. I feel very sad, children can not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie it is. This was one of the worst movies I saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open ending ... why? Because it is impossible to reach a decent for such a stupid story. This movie is only meant to scare you, and if you're a little smart and you know some music, you'll know exactly when you'll be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended and I turned to my friend and told him (a little loudly) that this was a total waste of money, a stupid child seemed strange to me. This day I could make an Oscar with a homemade video of my goldfish, if only I used the right marketing.
