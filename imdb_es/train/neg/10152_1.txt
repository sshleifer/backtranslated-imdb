Being a fan of corny horror movies, I saw it in my video store and I thought about trying it out. Now that I've seen it, I do not want there to be any living soul on the planet. I get my free movie rentals, and I feel like I did not get the value of my money. I've seen some malicious horror movies in my time, hell, I'm a fan of them, but this was just an insult.
