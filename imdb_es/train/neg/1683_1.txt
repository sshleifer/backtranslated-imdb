Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. In the best case, it made me jump a bit of surprise in a couple of moments. <br /> <br /> If one forgets the terrifying dimension (failed) and looks at the other sides of the film, he is disappointed again. The performance is fine but it's not great. The story can be interesting at first, while one tries to understand what is happening. But towards the end one understands that there is not much to understand. The "scary" elements sometimes seem to have been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) Watch this movie if you do not have anything more interesting to do, like cutting the carrots or looking to the clouds.
