Why do you insist on doing repetitions of great movies like "High Noon" "From Here to Eternity" and this one? <br /> <br /> Why do you think color is more absorbing for a viewer than dazzling black? And the white one? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on using that wide-billed dopey baseball cap? ... made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why would someone spend? Four hours suffering this? <br /> <br /> Look at the original. Then YOU will not have to ask WHY.
