A retired diplomat, played very well by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's police son. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old action movies of the 1980s that always present the Russians as bad evils to undermine the just government of the United States. It is interesting to see the Russian man as a hero this time. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's really an "B" action movie. Michael York gives some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian policeman is a little "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with anyone he is making a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this film any longer, it would have been an "B" action movie above average. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's very enjoyable to watch during the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is the typical villain. He is very blond and very evil in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's okay. It does not stink too much. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
