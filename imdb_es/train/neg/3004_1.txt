What a terrible movie. The performance was bad, the pace was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. A certain degree of evil is expected in a slasher, but even the murders were bad. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the past event that established the motive of the massacre lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have eliminated 80% and explained what happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims were invited to the "meeting" in an abandoned school that still had all public services turned on. One of the victims thought that this was a bit strange, but they discarded it and decided to enter anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the murders were so false that they could not be identified. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, and not very good breasts. This film makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
