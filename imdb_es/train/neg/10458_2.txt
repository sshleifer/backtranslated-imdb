I entered this film with the expectations, from the exaggeration, that it would be insightful and edifying. Certainly, something more than a cheap promotion for the band "Wilco". <br /> <br /> Instead, we have many criticisms and laments about the "process", a dishonorable and certainly unilateral portrait of the members of a band. Who was expelled by the lead singer / songwriter of the first donna, a heartrending confession by the friend of the fallen member, for about 18 years, saying that "friendship had run its course", and this plaintive and inflexible story about how the record label "hurts their feelings" by dropping them, just so the band can immediately get 50 offers from other labels (oh, the tension ... no!) They did everything possible to make it look like a tension, but I suspect everything It was smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did not exist. This does not even take into account the long stretches in which we receive many of his most recent songs without any history, vision or even a decent job in cinematography. The efforts forced by emotional sincerity or the reasonable perspective of life made me sick to see. <br /> <br /> In the movie, this band sounds like a bunch of vile babies peeking out to find a voice they do not know. they have and think that they are a kind of guardians of the art of music, which definitely are not. And I thought that the music reeked, and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the murmur style of the lead singer. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10.
