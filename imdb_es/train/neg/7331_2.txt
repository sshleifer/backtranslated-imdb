This movie was clearly done badly and in a hurry. I realize that it is difficult to obtain funds for a film of this type. However, if the plot had some kind of original substance, someone would have seen that it obtained the necessary funding, it did not, and films like this are not necessary in themselves and have no purpose. The plot of this film has been made and has been made better, I might add, many times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance to compete with any other. My computer informed me that I need a minimum of ten lines to send my comment, so the following lines are just a bull to complete the space. In my opinion, there is no need to say anything else about this movie. What I have said is enough and if you have lost enough time reading this review, that for the love of God do not waste more time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes to watch fucking movies that play on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 a.m. In that case, go ahead, see what matters to me.
