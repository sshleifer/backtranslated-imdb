This is not so much a movie as the big-budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'. When it is mentioned for the first time that a civilization has been eliminated by insomnia, I thought "Wow! A nihilistic martial arts movie!" but there is not so much luck. Although it must be considered experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrows of an old man. Zu Warriors has exactly the same meaning if the subtitles are activated or deactivated. That is not a good sign. I found the special effects somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: the warrior princess. Primitive.
