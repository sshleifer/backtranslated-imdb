Basically, this is an action / comedy too long and without grace. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie Scary Movie (1) by Wayans and that the sequel had its moments. Unfortunately, the white chicks do not even deliver half the laughs. <br /> <br /> The mood in him is absolutely raw. If you like to burp, fart, stupid phrases, you should probably look at this. When it is not raw it is idiot. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave me everything, totally carefree, just an idiot. <br /> <br /> However, I saw everything since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not have bothered). The story is undeniably thin, it was also in a scary movie, but at least the laughs were quick and constant. I think this is probably one of the main problems also with this movie, the laughs are not fast enough. Some jokes get too long when they are more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells, then avoid this. If you want a silly comedy with more laughter, watch a scary movie, a plane, hot photos 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely ungraceful, Thin storyline, a movie that seems to be based on a idea (that is, what would happen if we dressed like white girls for a movie?) but we just did not have enough material.
