If you want to see a good movie about how women can fight against sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie you want to see. It was a social comment about a woman who was victimized and defends herself. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson flips the tables on her attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to vigilantism. She essentially nullifies the judicial system. The movie "The Accused" was much better because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What does the "Descent" do when telling assault victims that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? Do not!!!
