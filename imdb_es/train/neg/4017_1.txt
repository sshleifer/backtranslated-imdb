Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did not like this at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene that fits a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return briefly to earth to experience the lust she had never experienced in her worldly life. Disgusting sex scenes to follow. Why are they wrong, on the one hand, they try so hard to be artistic that they take away the real sexual act? I mean we see porn for sex we do not do it. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it's still very erotic and nice to watch. Of course the girls in that are very nice. Here we have an unattractive main actress and that does not help things. If you find that the prominence of your adult film is unattractive, there is no artistic vision that makes me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean there's a snake in one of those people. So for me, this movie simply fails, since it does not excite me at all, but it turns me off.
