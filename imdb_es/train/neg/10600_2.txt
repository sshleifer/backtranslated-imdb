I will be honest. The only reason I saw him on TV is that he is in the last IMDb position. And right now, I wonder if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'control' on that same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who is in a big fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer took out a 'HAL' to defend himself. And yes, after all the forced explosions, shootings and persecutions, he is the last one standing. Combined with a terrible performance and a bit of a boring configuration, it ensures that it is a place on the infamous list. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see the full list. 2/10.
