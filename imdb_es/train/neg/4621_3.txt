After searching for this high and low movie, I found it when I least expected it, playing a day on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning. Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris made during the last years of the television program, I have no idea. The movie just gets horrible. The scripted part that deals with a week that is. Of course, the highlight of the movie is to see the real performers who were "too hot for television" or rejected for some reason or another. That part is still horrible, but bad of camp, which was nice in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for so long, will I see it again in my life? Resonant NO !! Do yourself a favor and just look a lot better at "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the real show. The performance of the girl in which I simply licked the paddles provocatively was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon in a flash that the audience probably made me sterile. In retrospect, I am very happy that this was a massive failure, because if it were a massive success, there could have been a "The Beauty Show Movie of $ 1.98" and THAT my friends would surely have brought the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My rating: D
