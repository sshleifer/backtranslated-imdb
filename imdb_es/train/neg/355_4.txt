Just Cause is one of those movies that at first made you wonder why it was so heavily programmed when it came out: nothing special, but competent enough and with an excellent performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts getting more and more silly until you have a killer with a flashlight tied to his forehead that threatens to fille the wife of Sean Connery (a Kate Capshaw typically educated and unconvincing) and a child (Scarlet Johannsen very young). ) In a crocodile hut. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie that probably looks best on an airplane, and even just once.
