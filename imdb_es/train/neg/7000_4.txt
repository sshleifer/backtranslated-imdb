Hollywood, the home of hype, glamor and the pursuit of profit, is hardly governed by spiritual values, so it is not surprising that their attempts to investigate spiritual life are thin and often stupid (it is better to go more far) to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to probe representations of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the ideas it tries to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to equal Verne (Clark Gable in his most arrogant and selfish attitude) and Julie (Joan Crawford, growling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of the Hard Ladies) ridiculous in the Best of cases. Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work, uniting egos at war before sending them to greater criminal servitude in the M-G-M lot? BUT. . There are good support actions here, and visually striking moments: the dark prison barracks; the boat that escapes in the light of the moon, or against a landscape of picturesque clouds; Julie walking along the seashore while the wind whips; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate Verne's freedom as the storm advances; An unusually ennobled gay prison romance between two convicts. . Above all, there is the dignified and distant performance of Paul Lukas as Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambreau, but turns his back on him. At the most striking moment of the film, Hessler, having left Cambreau, stands outside the booth. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see the shadows on his face, which transmits a moment of fear and doubt. Then it goes out into the night. At this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential force that none of the other characters manages to reach. Is it the secret of the film that their deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler?
