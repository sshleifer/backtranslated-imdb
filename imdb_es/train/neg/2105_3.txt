Bela Lugosi is a scary scientist who uses orchids to attract brides to steal the essence of an elderly wife's life. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious! A lot of monsters, plus a lot of stuffing and no argument makes watching this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces came together at the end in typical Hollywood fashion. History never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless as you look. <br /> <br /> Usually, I got low-caliber movies like this, but the dwarf added enough craziness and entertainment to win a couple more points.
