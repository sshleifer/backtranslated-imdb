Squeamish Luke Benward, 11 years old (while Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In his new school, the young Benward is chosen by the other boys. They put worms in their thermos. Putting his gag reflex under control, Benward launches a worm against Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benward bets that he can eat 10 worms in a day, without regurgitation! <br /> <br /> Hallie Kate Eisenberg, tall and mocking (like Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worm was harmed when making this movie." On a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a funny scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on the popular novel by Thomas Rockwell. Preadolescent children in disgusting should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat fried worms (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
