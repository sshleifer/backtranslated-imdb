The small town of Diablo, in California, is plagued with mysterious deaths after Sheriff Robert Lopez unearthed an old box. The legend says that the box contains the 16th-century Mexican demon called Azar. FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the daughters of the sheriff, Dominique and Mary fight with the evil demon and thirsty for blood. "The Devil legend" is absolute rubbish. The film lacks fear and gore, the acting is amateur and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect. of the movie that I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of indie horror movies, for example, I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a great Misfire. Definitely one for avoid.
