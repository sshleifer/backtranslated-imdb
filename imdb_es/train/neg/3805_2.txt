Err ... this movie stunk. MUCH. <br /> <br /> I have been reading some of the other comments. Apparently there are many people who think that everything that Woody Allen writes or stars is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I have seen several of his films, with the vain hope that I am missing something. But no, they just suck. Badly written garbage. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to mention they are pretty stupid). The argument is ... I think it's supposed to be mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, in any other movie I've seen of him. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, go see this movie. If you are under 50, do not bother. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen And you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical, I do not know what to say).
