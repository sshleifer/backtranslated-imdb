Considering that the original version of the film 'The Haunting' is in my ten best films of all time, I approached this adaptation with fear, I was right to be cautious, since this film is a poorly written and poorly executed of all the old ones, all the involved one should be ashamed! The original terrified me as a child for a reason! You do not see anything Robert Wise used an innovative camera work and an excellent illumination to generate fear and that is why it works The shame of the new version is that it is based on intelligent special effects and pyrotechnics to go from A to B, but the saddest thing is that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different This movie should only be seen as an example of studio butchery!
