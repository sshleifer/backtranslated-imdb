Do you know that feeling of hilarity that you get when you see a movie that tries to be a piece of serious cinema that makes you think and fails miserably? When can not you stop laughing at the terrible nature of the trash that litters your screen? "House of the Dead" strives to reach even this level of low-rated cinema. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling that you just woke up to discover it. that the cat has put your business carefully curled on your forehead while you were sleeping. It is clear from the beginning that the female actors have been chosen for their cleavage size (they exploit blatantly) while the males for their "kick" attitude. Honestly, I did not care about any of the characters at any time in the movie and I found myself really looking forward to his disappearance to avoid a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered projecting two hours of images of the real game as a movie. At least then we will have better performance? However, you can not blame the actors, as it is certainly a challenge to produce a compelling film when faced with the script of this film. It could be said to be the worst section of the film and actually contains lines like: "These are zombies, pure and simple" and "No, we should not go there! It's evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly provocative or full of meaning; In the best of cases, they are two harmless hours of action, terror of blood and closet. Garbage, yes, but garbage entertaining. It's not the kind of garbage that comes out of your garbage bag when you drag it around the room and smother your shoes in cartons of sour milk and rotting banana skins. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received criticism so bad that no Danish cinema bought the film. If only we could have had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
