The best of the best 4, is better than 3, but hardly. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (like 3), (that is, it's not a reference to Tommy Lee having siblings). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked Russian. trace the storyline, and especially the bit part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. Apart from that and some fight scenes, the movie is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the plane's explosion scene). <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 does not really have a moral or anything like part 3, there are a couple of more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but unfortunately there's nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the best of the best is the Rhee shows, and to be honest, you can not take a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw on tape, Rating: 4
