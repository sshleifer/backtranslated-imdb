Well ... in contrast to other comments written previously, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that one of them looked a bit like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any prize, and although I am sure that a great effort was made to achieve it, everything was unsuccessful, since the final result is one that screams at the beginning of the 90 foreign telenovelas. The plot did not exist, the cinematography was desperate and the performance was on par with a performance of a level. Unfortunately it was long and the subplots were incredibly unrealistic ... for example ... if your best friend slept with your 6 year old ex boyfriend after only 2 weeks of being divided, they would not be the best of friends. Everything was fantasy. That is all! Oh yes, and the strange house of the 90s / soft core indie was awesome.
