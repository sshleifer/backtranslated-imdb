Now I can see clearly why Robin Hood failed quickly. The first episode is probably the worst thing that the BBC has issued. The first scenes were as intense, significant and intelligent as two fighting monkeys, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was simply ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood kissing some cows with makeup at the beginning of the episode: how many people used eyeliner in the 12th century? No one. It is possible that the series has improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly discouraged people's hopes and is essentially a pile of cr * p. A great hero of England has been dishonored. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate it?" I will not, that's for sure, unless the BBC begins to understand what smart investment is. 3/10
