Boring and meaningless movie with charismatic mercury completely wasted. Launched for a minute on a Thursday in perhaps a local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney, except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project apparently created by a producer seeking a fee. Local actors such as John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well, Polson has become a Director of suspicious as SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Serious Terry never seems to get a guernsey apart from the roles of bully. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's biggest exports on screen. Roles like this are big disappointments and movies like this are just a waste of time and talent.
