A "friend", clearly without taste or class, suggested that I take a look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see anything else about him. It is an amateur garbage, self-indulgent, criminally bad quality and self-indulgent. The "fucking man" title is an angry low-budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of prostitutes. There is a bit of nudity and some erections, but no element can save this from the hangman's rope. The lighting is frightful, the dialogue is puerile and in its majority it is shouted, and the direction is clueless. I saw a doc about American filmmakers operating during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of the standouts. He spoke as if there was something important in his work, but after seeing this, I do not see anything important at all. There is also no style, and the horrible video effects (such as solarization) only improve the amateur character. Not even so bad is fun. Avoid.
