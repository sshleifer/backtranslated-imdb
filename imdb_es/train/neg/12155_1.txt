If this film was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a cult classic to the bad movie, it could (I think it could have been a success). Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so horrible that it becomes fascinating in terms of its failures? Well, this is it. Each of the acting actors must be nominated for the worst acting awards. It would be difficult to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little value at all. All this, from the first scenes, defies logic. The dialogue is completely incredible and illogical. The same goes for the behavior and general plot of the film itself. What is really amazing, is that some buffoons in a boardroom really made decisions to spend money on this garbage. Wow.
