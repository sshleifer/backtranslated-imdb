What do you get when you have bad acting, bad direction, scenes that are extremely long, a terrible illumination, a painful edition and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A ghost story It seems to be shot on betacam, which is fine, but lighting has to complement this medium. In this case it does not. There are some CUs where the person's face is completely in the shade. One scene in particular is the scene of the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have been cut in half easily ... but I suppose they would not have a feature film then. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he should have some "hero" elements in his character, but he does not. He complains and is afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they had a good movement of the camera. Pity that the lighting did not complement it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and that's where it ends. Simply terrible
