by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> A gang of thieves. The perfect plan. Everything's going wrong. They are in trouble. The police are out. They are cornered. What are they going to do now? <br /> <br /> Do you sound familiar? <br /> <br /> It seems that the film tries to be a combination of the acting workshop, the "indie" movie and the theater. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing that the actors love, it's like a workshop or a play because it consists mainly of a strict approach of the acting actors ... acting angry, tense, scared, talking, scheming , planning, giving artists a wide range of freedom to really ruin everything. <br /> <br /> A trio of criminals, a leader, a bully, a brother, come with a grand theft plan. .. and a wrench is thrown to the works. To top things off, there is a bit of "fender bender" and one of the thieves is thrown through the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The policemen are on their line and they run into a bar called poetically (and with lead) "Dino's Last Chance". <br /> <br /> Spacey, as director, tries to keep the focus on the performances and the delivery of dialouge of the actors. He is approaching a glowing, red-smoked Bogart passion-red cigarette ad. And it keeps all the violence off the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intensity and horrible, violent scenes would have given the film a bit of an edge. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it moves very slowly and suffers errors in almost all roles. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag Along with these guys, Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional police lieutenant of rabid and grumpy dogs, but he has nothing to do here <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grunt that only wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the thieves are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or try to think of a way out of this. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it running. Most of the characters are chatting, trying to think of a plan ... and they are too calm and articulate. There is even a scene in which criminals play pool with a swarm of armed policemen just outside, ready to attack. At one point, one of the criminals even called the police that is right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh, annoyance. <br /> <br /> These policemen will destroy them or lock them up. Should not the locked thieves be a little scared, a little uncomfortable? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. <br /> <br /> Someone pulls out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off the screen and there's one more victim that happens to be ... well, a little sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway should also have spent more time with a dialect trainer, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A policeman listening for a package of matches at the worst moment is a good look. And so it is a scene in which someone crosses the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the dialogue is trying to approach David Mamet and it is so profane, but never so realistic or so insightful. <br /> <br /> The movie seems too much of what it really is ... a low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that "is not bad, but it needs a little more rewriting. " Spacey proves that he is not a terrible director, but he lacks the feeling of "shaping a movie" and feels as if he is just filming the act of the actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from misunderstandings. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to say that the wrong actors were chosen. I think they found the correct cast, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think that changing some of the roles would have helped enormously. <br /> <br /> By having veteran Mafia actor Joe Mantagna play the pack leader, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside his megaphone giving orders and barking his troops, keeping Fischter in his "thug thirsty for blood" and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors direct, it works. They can even win an Oscar for it. But most of the time, when the actors direct, they have a tendency to focus only on the performances. Simply film the actors acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for this. <br /> <br /> Hostage situations are virtually the same in real life, as are stories of coming of age, so it is only natural that movies about them go from point A to point B as well. . <br /> <br /> There are some really great entries in this genre. 'Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: "The Negotiator". <br /> <br /> This certainly will not become a cult classic, let alone one of the 100 AFI. However, it has some pleasant moments. and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that will play better on normal television. It just is not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The other Spacey credit for the address, "Beyond the Sea" was supposedly a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You need to fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
