Well ... in general, this movie was pretty useless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when my friends and I went to a blockbuster in search of a horror movie. It definitely was not what we were looking for, but humor satisfied us. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially that Tracy girl every time she's in the clogged room and tells the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they are acting. And also when the clown is looking through that black paper box and grabs Mark, he does not even look scared even though the clown grabbed him and started attacking him. And, seriously, would you be JOGGING if they chased you? I would be running for my life! (Although it is likely that someone can beat that clown because he weighs 300 pounds). Not to mention that the effects are not so good, like when the clown cuts Susan's head in the woods, and then every time he throws his head inside. fourth with Denise and Tracy when Denise throws her head back. Also as in the previous guy's comment, the beginning does not make any sense and I do not even see why it was included in the movie. So, what was this movie made in 2003? The music made it look like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Does not even look really professional. Half of the time, it seems that the camera can not even stay stable when it is supposed to be. In general, I have to say that I enjoyed the movie. However, I would not recommend it if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something to tease or make you laugh, I recommend it.
