Ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying race, ohhhh the feeling of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! My God, when will Westerners stop analyzing everything you want from the revisionists for shouting out loud? S ** t happens. If it offends your social sensibility, go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Waste of boring, tedious and very boring celluloid, especially in light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you're obsessed with a 19th-century desert dentist. It may have been a little better without the constant deviation of the Mexican guy with the bad tooth out of place. A monument to the stupid extreme left drag of the 60/70. Practically impossible to sit through the entire movie. I think I'd rather have my eyes open for the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10-all hell.
