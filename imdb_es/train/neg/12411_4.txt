There were a lot of really cool horror films produced in the seventies, but this movie is certainly not one of them! It is a pity that The Child is not better, since it works from a decent idea that includes a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child, which worked as well in classic films as The Bad Seed and then we have the central theme of the zombies, which of course has been the backbone of many successful horror films. Basically, the plot is as follows: the girl blames a group of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to take revenge (as you do). All this is very good, except for the fact that it is boring! Nothing happens in most of the film, and although it is retaken at the end with a little blood; It is not a sufficient end to justify sitting through the rest. The film was obviously filmed on a budget since the locations seem cheap and all the actors are garbage. There really is not much I can say about the movie in general since there is not much of that. The Child is a sad horror movie of the seventies and I certainly do not recommend it.
