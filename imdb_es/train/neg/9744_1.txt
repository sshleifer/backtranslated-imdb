This is one of the worst things that have come out of England, so it says a lot there. However, the tension when we have to find out if Lembach is staying is amazing. The positive side is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, at her picnic table, printing the underwear for a while after being caught by Dr. Rata Cara. This movie has several views of London too, although none of them is good. There is also a point where there is almost an automobile accident that makes your heart rate back below normal. There is also a watch that teleports, and the fear that the woman does not recover her watch is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense", but much more boring and British. Add a furious gun fight between the British police and Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus the electrocution of many people, plus a cat and you have ... ummm ... A British movie. The MST3K version is quite good although none of the best.
