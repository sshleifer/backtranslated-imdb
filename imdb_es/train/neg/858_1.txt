I hate this movie! It was NOT ANYTHING like the book, and just thinking about it drives me crazy. If you see the movie before reading the book, yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was INCREDIBLE and this movie had nothing to do with it. I mean, the general meaning might be similar, but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The end for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape a few seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version, Jack takes them through a stupid labyrinth ... Yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that Jack just killed Mr. Halloran. what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him as if it were not important. In general, it was simply bad that the movie was extremely off.
