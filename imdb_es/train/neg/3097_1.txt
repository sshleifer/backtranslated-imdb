There can be spoiler questions for this movie, the director beat us all too and ruined this movie in so many ways. <br /> <br /> A flagrant scam of things like Critters and Gremlins, this film fails on so many levels to recover the humor and horror of those best made movies. It ends with a sordid waste of time, where the bad actors give a bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally throws them plush toys. They fight with these toys in the same way that the old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them while screaming and doing everything possible to make it look a little threatening. It is painful to see it, and it does not help with the mental fashions of the 80s carried by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been caught by a security guard aged in a lot of movies are finally released after a year of confinement, and begin to screw telepathically with the minds of the people. The new recruit of the guards, the idiot who let them out in spite of repeated warnings, gathers his gang of friends from the 80s and they leave and have small adventures together while trying to recover the ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knuckle athlete, his dating slut of the '80s, the hero's cold and cunning girlfriend, and the young hero, who lacks confidence and He wants his girlfriend out anyway. <br /> <br> Firstly, there is the infamous rake-fighting scene, where the ex-soldier shows him how he was trained in the army to be a bully, that he hits the nerd hero with the wrong end of a rake during the raid. That seems to be hours. Then there are some running around, ending up in a real cake fighting style that ends up in a nightclub with comedy grenades that explode everything except the people who are right next to you. Then the movie ends, and all good, that ends well. <br /> <br /> It is not. This is like watching a train crash, you can not take your eyes off him, it's so bad. The perfect food for Mystery Science Theater, but unfortunately, if you try to see it alone and without cuts. The fashion police still has a series of pending orders for the cast, and I dare no one laugh with total ridicule in the rake fight. This scores 2 out of 10 at the most, on a good day.
