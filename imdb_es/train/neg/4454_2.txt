First some background; I am English and I have lived in London all my life. I have been in many games on 'The Den' and on most of the London club grounds. I'm familiar with the kind of person who gets into vandalism and I know how they act and how they talk. I have to say that this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unreal movies I've seen. I spent most of the movie shrinking in shame. I felt that I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out some things. <br /> <br /> a) People just do not talk like that in real London life; the filmmakers took the whole matter of the jargon and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately, hooligan types exist, but those seen on Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded like 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He is from the north of Newcastle and I am surprised that any of the other actors can be frank acting with him. How are we supposed to take it seriously? Why they not only got someone from East London to interpret that part, it surpasses me. I could have done a "hard work" myself, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can you expect him to take Elijah Wood seriously kicking the butt of people who double their size and who are really nasty hooligans? He would be dead Simple like that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was difficult to see this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will be a bomb here in the UK. It may be a little better in the states because Americans simply will not know (or will not care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not create a word of this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but everything is extremely clandestine and silent, and on a much smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed a bit in London. Usually, they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and they hope we do not realize it.
