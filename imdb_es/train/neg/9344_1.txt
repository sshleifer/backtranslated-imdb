As others have pointed out, this film is a load of pretentious nonsense for the careless or the masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know, after seeing the presence of trains and the acid house, that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike Trainspotting and Acid House, without a good dose of humor or gritty realism, movies like this do not work. And, what is more important, without a decent script, a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or stimulating about the script of this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won a couple of Bafta shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought that the Australian film industry was pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I would not even bother to rent it in the weekly section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide detour.
