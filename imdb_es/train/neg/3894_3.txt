The Incredible Melting Man plays as an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this movie is a bit unpleasant, but it seemed impossible to me that I do not like it. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year movie with a $ 50 budget: the title character takes a long time to merge, but when it does it's pretty impressive; We also have an inventive death scene that involves electrocution. Music is also outstanding, it's crazy - a mixture of cheese-flavored nonsense. <br /> <br /> Highlights: <br /> <br /> * Marvel at the slow-motion nurse who jumps through a glass panel for no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised by a day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibal humanoid that melts. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed when our hero takes a break from hunting the melt crazy to grab a bowl of soup and complain that there are not enough cookies in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is too 70 for me to hate it. It's in poor taste and trash, but I thought it was really fun. You could do much worse.
