This is one of those horrible sex-driven sex movies that could not have been played anywhere near a theater. The women run around dressed in "bunny" costumes with little clothes, an extremely fat woman is the worst part of many jokes without flavor, and they all work in the restaurant of a dirty old man, who has a strange son (Jim Hanks, of course Tom's brother), whom the man wants to "throw out". Hanks is really good, but this movie is not going anywhere and does not make sense. One must ask why it was even done? However, due to Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but not more than a few), he received a stellar "2" of 10. However, I think he was being nice.
