Add to the list of cartoons: a southern preacher and a "congregation," a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing choir and The Mills Brothers - only make it worse. <br /> <br /> Despicable burlesques of "black" artists, who often appear in films parodying themselves and their race. Although the "black comedy" may have been accepted in its day, today it is extremely offensive, and I doubt it has ever been fun. Although I would not have offended, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak attempts at humor. However, as an 11-year-old white child, I might not have understood something of that.
