"Meatball Machine" has to be one of the most complex, ridiculous and exaggeratedly exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever encountered. It is about good against evil and a story about coming of age, with the aim of entertaining with a bloody, poor quality and humorous context. Because of that, violence is not particularly frightening and does not make you tremble, but free bloodletting and nudity runs freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I've seen. If that was not enough, it is also run by an unheard-of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just has it all, it's bad for the bone! You have to see it for all the fans of the B movies! ... Simply: a rare and funny gem.
