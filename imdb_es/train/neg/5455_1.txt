I saw this work at a film festival in California. My God, what was the director thinking? Film teachers should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film. First of all, this project does not make any sense at all. The film takes place partially in "The Waystation", a stupid insipid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> The action is beyond the bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The main actress, Julia Reading, is one step below acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including those who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use his actors. The only thing worse than the performance was the dialogue, which bordered on the absurd. The writer (who I assume is also the director) writes each character as if they were auditioning for a comic book villain. <br /> <br /> The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, with such a bad movie it's easy to overlook it. The production design is quite good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and makeup are fine, and I understand that the production was running on a low budget. It's just when the characters talk, or try to push the plot, the movie disintegrates into a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is horrible. It's as if the director / writer watched many science fiction movies and threw all the parts he liked in a blender and managed. My only hope is that he used other people's money for this, because if he used hers, he's a total fool.
