I also saw this incredibly bad piece of "anime" at the Science Fiction Festival in London. If you HAVE to see this, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, and then you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue seemed hilarious to me, because in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The animation is horrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It may have been a good idea for producers to have hired at least one person who was not blind to color. <br /> <br /> There's nothing more to say, this movie is a failure at all levels.
