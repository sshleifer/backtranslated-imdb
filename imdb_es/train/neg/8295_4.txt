I usually like movies based on characters. I also think that Hope Davis becomes a consistently good job, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon frustrated. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of this movie is the address. There are many scenes that are dream sequences. The film makes frequent use of the character of Denis Leary as the alter ego of Campbell Scott's character. It does not work at all. This would have worked better as a game than as a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a film make a trip and end up in a different place from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experiences portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the edition was not well done either. There was a big fall in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring. <br /> <br /> Except for the performance, which I felt was very strong, this film failed in almost all aspects of cinema.
