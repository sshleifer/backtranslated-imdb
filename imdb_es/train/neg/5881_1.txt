Absolutely the most boring movie in which I have spent my money. This was the wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was represented in a less inspiring way. There is no talent to act, just read a part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth made it look ugly on the one hand not rewarded, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies she chooses to play, like all these great stars that have left me disappointed by the way all They have allowed their talents to be stifled into a feature that leaves a lot to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the audience to anticipate a great performance in a movie that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. There was not a time when the cast could represent any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ... whatever.
