This movie was a bit confusing at first. Usually, I like Gina Phillips, but I have to say it was a bad choice, like her doing the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that's not one of her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally scared me and in the end, that was crazy. It was Jennifer Cassi (Phillips), who attends the funeral of her twin sister. She stays in a house that her sister owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is sacrificing her relationships a bit to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries. Crows have a rare part in it. When relationships fall asleep, the Ravens eat organs there, so they can not go to sleep. But they do it. Basically, everything is crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, because they have to suffer forever so that Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, I'm sorry. I love you.
