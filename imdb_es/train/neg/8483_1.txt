Normally I only write reviews of movies that I really hated or liked. And, as you can probably see from the amount of stars up there, I did not like it. At this point, I guess you've read about the plot or maybe you've even seen the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's analyze this, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: The concept: the premise was established to be interesting. Using chaos theory as a subject was interesting. However, it was not carried out so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos theory was misrepresented. The event that happened in the movie seemed more like an artificial coincidence than anything else. I suppose that the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God (is) causes the Tsunami to return the statue". The presentation comes out as very careless though. Some people call it smart, but it seems to be another action movie. <br /> <br /> Story: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just threw this to give him an excuse to play? ten roles? The plot is extremely artificial; Govind continued to lose the bottle so many times in dark accidents (his friend simply mixes the bottle with a package he was sending to India, a crazy old woman simply throws the bottle at an idol, half the plaster simply happens, unexpectedly they meet in the same hospital, and the case with the idol was mistaken for one that belonged to a famous singer. <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh, God, the CGI It was even worse than the special effects on Jaws 3, and those They immediately sucked in. I could see which parts were animated, even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look like that. <br /> <br /> Tips: Yes, now that the action scenes in the movies Tamils ​​are not realistic, but the tricks in this scene were horrible and actually distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Do up: I have to admit that they did a better job than expected.I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so what Two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido took me by surprise. However, it was still pretty bad, I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: the music distracted and was out of place in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: His character was possibly the most annoying of the movie. She was loud, silly and irrationally obsessed with that idol. In fact, I found myself wanting her to die. <br /> <br /> Parcels and refrigerator logic: Let me clarify this: a lab monkey was smart enough to go through a locked door with a password, but not enough to say it. The difference between a chocolate bar and a vial with a deadly virus. And then, a former CIA agent behind the jar realizes that he is heading to India. Instead of following him immediately, he marries first a bar dancer. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer enters a hospital in a small city in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. In addition, he is shot in the throat with a bullet. One would think that they would kill him, but instead, the magic bullet has cleared his tumor. You read well, a BULLET eliminated the tumor. <br /> <br /> Advantages ... Naidu's character: Possibly the only nice part of the movie was his comedy.
