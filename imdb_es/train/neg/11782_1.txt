The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me for being the worst movie I've seen to date. I did not think it would be possible to overcome my list of bad bad movies, but it deserves gold. It's not funny. It's bad acting, it's bad filmed and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls. I really think that this film has the potential to hit the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish film ever made! And that is really something. Congratulations in advance!
