Three lines of history and not enough tying them together, "Inside Man" was very nervous and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Despite having their moments, the film began as a fast-moving thriller that moved quickly to the ground, jumped quickly between ups and downs, and barely regained steam around the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his role extremely well with a total understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as "evil genius" and "intellectual brain" (both are not the same in hindsight). However, in general, each person created a large individual subsection. However, when the parties finally joined and everything counted, there was no "ah-ha" suddenly. Or summary of everything. It all ended with very little of the energy with which it began, with many holes in the plot, tons of questions and, as I said before, it is not close to the normal level of Spike Lee. I have to completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the film they interpret as it should be.
