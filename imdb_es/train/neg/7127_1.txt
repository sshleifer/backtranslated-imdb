This movie was bad to say the least !!! The large number of superb cars are dishonored by having been shown in this LAME movie. Start with a career of L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1hr 45min ... on a Ferrari F430. I did that in 1HR 50min in a small 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not do justice to these cars. Obviously, these writers are just that and probably drive below the speed limit with their hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock. I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed with a Ferrari Enzo of 1.5 million dollars going to 30-40 MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people liked orally just breaking into Hollywood. He participated in a film that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> cheap money stealing whores. Asian men >> losing compulsive gamblers and thugs who are defeated all the time. What the hell is all the fear of Asians? Why the need to portray them always in such a negative connotation? I'm so sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays Asians with such a false and false pretext.
