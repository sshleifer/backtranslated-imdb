This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, a paintball team that has no experience and strives for recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialogue, bad editing and a half-written story! The characters at first were interesting, only to lose strength halfway to become one-dimensional people spitting tired phrases. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent a little more time in the story and the dialogue, it would have been a great movie, rather than an almost last-minute effort.
