As Steven Segal's movies go this is the bottom of the barrel. His best was forage for bored teenagers. He tilts the balance, then falls. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can not spoil you by telling you the end. You already know how Steven Segal's films end if you've seen one. Here it goes. He is an agent of the government who does too much work and knows too much to untie himself, so they decide, instead of killing him, to get high on his brain until he does not remember. He escapes, of course, is arrested and is located by his old general, who needs his only man with a million experience to recover a sneaky plane that has been delivered to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by an Air Force pilot who , surprised, surprise, training segal. All the heroes, except the character of Segal and his dark girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world at once, or falls suddenly. Whatever is. Made with a little aerial film from the Air Force and the Navy. And many boom-booms. Get some cartoon of Popeye instead.
