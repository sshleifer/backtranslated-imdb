The social commentary was exaggerated and the mystery itself was constructed and resolved through a series of implausible coincidences that were totally incredible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last decade, which makes it remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries he has in England. Can not you insinuate yourself into the Australian police? It seems a very artificial plot point to involve him in a crime investigation. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and this takes on that mantle. Instead of returning to the focus of series one. Sad.
