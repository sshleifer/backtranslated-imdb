The story is about the lives of the ordinary people of Antwerp, living their lives. So I said it, and there's nothing more to tell about the story. The film is fast, like an MTV movie, well photographed and we think the director has talent and should make more movies. So let's forget about this and hopefully the best with the next photo of Deus-Barman.
