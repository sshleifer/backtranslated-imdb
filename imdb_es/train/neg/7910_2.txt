I saw most of "My Girlfriend of Bollywood" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and I had to leave the theater due to the feelings of nausea that arose within me. I've seen Bollywood movies and satires from Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide what it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke in itself. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been copied generously from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy, lazy job in that. How can Bollywood be exiled from his determination to stick to scripts that are too used and trodden? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real and fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people? The driver of too intelligent cars, the cow in the street, free scenes of foreign places, meaningless scenes of the streets of Mumbai, are all there. Every possible clich√© about India has been faithfully included. So disgustingly predictable. ugh !!! Acting performances are weak in all areas, except Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why he would choose a project like this.
