This is a really horrible movie. What they have done is take a television program, which was never aimed at young children and they gave him the treatment of George Lucas (that is, he ruined it by his deduction to attract the younger audience). <br /> <br /> Well, then The Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cerebral, in fact, it was pretty much formulated, but it was always fun to watch it (especially when the models exploded) and the voice cast was not so bad. <br /> <br /> This suffers from a poor cast and a bad performance (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only cast members who have an idea of ​​how they should interpret his characters) & after this farce I did not let Frakes direct the traffic. <br /> <br /> The central point of the Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, avoiding disasters or rescuing those involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this crap like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give it 1 in 10 because a rating of zero is not compatible.
