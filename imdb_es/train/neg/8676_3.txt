Avoid the USA version. It is with additional images from the USA. UU And the worst dubbing I've ever heard, probably made by New York fans. The dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black man from the Bronx makes the voice of Chiba. I could not see the whole movie that was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, see other Chiba greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
