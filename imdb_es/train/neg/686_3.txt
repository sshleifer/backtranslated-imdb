In what would be his first script, based on his own short story "Turn About", William Faulkner presents a strange story of loyalty, sacrifice and really strange relationships. The story originally was only about the characters of Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another image to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner was committed to creating a female role. Crawford insisted that his lines be written in the same clipped style as Young and Tone of his co-stars, which caused an unintentional hilarity since these three communicate in a shorthand similar to a telegraph that sounds like a sketch of Monty Python ( "Wuthering Heights" played at a traffic light). Seriously, almost unspoken sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some familiar themes of Faulkner, with an almost unusually close relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "sanctuary", and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in the presence of Tone, instead of an engagement ring, ALL THREE exchange their engraved childhood rings with each other. The closeness of Tone and Young is also remarkable, especially when they are heading to their destination of Thelma and Louise. Frankly, it's scary. <br /> <br /> However, it is not so creepy for this New Yorker, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, that Crawford cheerfully catches (and that is shown spinning in his hands - I Had to get away! ) and Young becomes a gladiator. Blech <br /> <br /> That said, there are some good performances. Young is particularly involved in a scene in which he finds himself on Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is a delight as Cooper's flying partner. The tone, despite his inability to express himself through a realistic dialogue, has a pleasant moment, and he gets rid of his own furtive tears about the fate of his friend Young. Crawford, also stripped of meaningful dialogue, is presented primarily as wood or melodramatic, which is an act of balance for a role. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes, as is logical, for a Howard Hawks movie. -It's the most exciting part of the whole image. But not enough. As far as I'm concerned, these are the 75 minutes of my life that I'll never return to.
