From time to time a movie appears that knocks me down a bit and reminds me that my taste for the movies I'm looking for is not always impeccable. Normally I would stay away from this kind of thing, but I was fooled by some enthusiastic reviews and the pedigree Rohmer. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in the production in which Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors on painting (digital). ) Background of the revolution was France. This fades quickly and becomes as interesting as seeing the paint dry in a scene of painting by numbers. What we have left is a boring and suffocating film about aristocrats in eighteenth-century France. None of the characters is attractive or sympathetic. The pace is so languid, the dialogue is so arduous and the suspense is clearly a strange concept for Rohmer, that in the end I did not care who touched his head, who harbored who or what the hell was supposed to be the revolution. The film would have benefited enormously from an appearance of emotional accumulation and a musical score (in the end, very good classical music is used). Despite being so "talkative", the film is very much like a silent movie, and the worst kind of movie, a boring and uninteresting movie on infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find something to draw from this film, as they seem to paint well-known events from a new angle (the lady is English and a realist). Otherwise, avoid this yawn at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (I fell asleep twice).
