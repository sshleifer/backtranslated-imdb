The Lives of the Saints begins with an atmospheric view of London as a bustling city of busy, picturesque streets and sun. I expected him to maintain this atmosphere, but he gets stuck in a story that is not getting anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the big, fat Mr. Karva, his stepfather and crime boss (at least, I think that's what he's supposed to be because he's never really defined, but he does drop the kittens to the thick fried ones, so trust me, he's an imbecile doing small errands while his nasty girlfriend gives daddy a job. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always goes from A to B. When he meets a near-silent homeless child who gives him his wish to stop running, Runner leaves the lost child in Othello's flat, where he quickly begins to grant more wishes. His own wishes, Karva has kidnapped the child, but he is not sure what would really bring him happiness, is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another manual labor? Anyway, I do not want to see the little boy give the second. <br /> <br /> It only takes years to get in March and there are a lot of repetitive scenes. The end tries to be shocking, but as there is almost no background story in the investment in any of these characters, it only serves as a launch for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> The writer Tony Grisoni, favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to mix in some kind of religious allegory that ends up being pretentious like all hell, ironically. If it gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters to act strangely, then it would have been a nicer movie. As things stand, they introduce us to a group of crazy and insane who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Those who are the origins are never revealed. That is simply irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from the sporadic moments of the atmosphere and the music in a bad mood, this movie has little to recommend.
