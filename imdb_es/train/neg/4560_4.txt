Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment to me. While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, there is simply no cure for a poor script once in production. The film really had a "sequel" feel, playing with the partial events of the first movie. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. He did not think well, and sometimes he seemed very choppy and incoherent. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB Organization had a kind of "elite" sense of strength. You had a few special agents, and I had a "clandestine" feeling. In the sequel, the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp environment. <br /> <br /> The film was not terrible or anything ... it just lacked the "coldness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first film. Much of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and did not really add any originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worthy to carry your title? Not really.
