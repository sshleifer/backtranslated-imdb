There have been so many movies based on the same theme. A pretty girl needs a handsome boy to impress her ex, she pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there's a bit of clumsiness followed by a row before they all recover before the happy ending ... This has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing is, I knew this before I started looking. But, despite this, I was still waiting for him. In the right hands, with a good cast and a brilliant script, it can still be a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> This was not any of this. <br /> <br /> This was serious. <br /> <br /> A woman who lacked charm or ingenuity and who totally failed to ignite even the slightest spark in me. I really did not care if she "got her man" or remained unmarried and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male leader who, after some of his endless words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to take away that smug look. I had no idea that living a male whore life was the path to enlightenment that knows everything. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic film full of unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have work, all had more money than sense, a boyfriend who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his girlfriend had slept with his best friend ... more "I would miss you even if we had never met"! !!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I'm losing even more time in this scum ... I could bother presenting a character just to laugh at the "woody" name, but that was really the reason. Only the remotely humorous thing that happened in the movie.
