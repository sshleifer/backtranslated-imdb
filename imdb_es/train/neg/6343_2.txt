Maybe I'm not a sophisticated one. This and Closer are two of the most supposedly cerebral films I've seen recently, and both suffer exactly the same problem to an unbearable degree. The dialog is false false false false. Nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely credible. Maybe the way this movie is set up is the way it's supposed to feel, but it could not be seen. And boring. I left after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I stay with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen arrangement. If I ever encounter this in the teevee, I'll turn around and try to find an episode of Quincy.
