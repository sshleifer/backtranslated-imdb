Rajinikanth is born again after obtaining a magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the informal audience: the 50ish Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door believes that he is a convincing "child" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, and the worst thing is how the women of yesteryear did their exercise through domestic work. However, we must believe that he is not a theist. although it was well read, it wastes six of its seven powers on a stupid comet; I can continue, but you get an idea. <br /> <br /> There are male gods, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth. The board finds it difficult to fit Rajinikanth into one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what the Tamil heroes do: face the villains and, despite being the oldest, be courted by the prettiest girl in the movie. Rajinikanth does it well and some of Rajinikanth's trademark styles are really nice: the "slime count" is a novelty. What makes this film unbearable is that those initial few minutes are just a preface to a worst book ever written. Even that preface is peppered with a comedy that is forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero faces several obstacles (on the part of politicians, as usual) but we can not really encourage him because we do not know what the final goal of the hero is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another of his sermons and moves away to become a hermit. The director does not offer any solution to the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is very interesting. Either it shows spots of brilliance or it did not bother to completely invest in this movie, who can blame it. There is a scene in which Rajinikanth enters the van of one of the thieves and then throws the knife and begins his slobber account. Music is very appropriate at the moment and acts as a catalyst that adds more tension. The songs are all mediocre, nobody would bother with the songs of this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest range you can assign in IMDb. This film has all the elements that justify its rightful place in the IMDb ranking.
