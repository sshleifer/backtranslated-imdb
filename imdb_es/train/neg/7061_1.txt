I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point in this movie. <br /> <br /> Because of the content that is supposed to be so "rebellious" and "controversial", the things that Maddox distributes to the students are terribly foolish. . Students seem to be easily influenced by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and fragments of words scrawled illegibly in pamphlets. Rebel, everyone. <br /> <br /> I suppose it would have been too much to ask for a rebellion movie for teenagers in which a school fire alarm does not fire. <br /> <br /> Apparently a "The big fight on the football fields" is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> The personalities of the characters seem to vary enormously at random. A soccer athlete that Maddox was fighting (and then received a staple in the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it does not reach any real conclusion of the plot. It makes me feel that everything could have been installed in a half hour after the special school. If they had cut off most of the pseudo-bug soundtrack attempt.
