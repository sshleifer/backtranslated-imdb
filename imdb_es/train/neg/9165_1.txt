There are no spoilers in this review because everything was shown in the trailer of the movie. I'm trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local films, but I can not help but support the backlash against this movie. It's slow, boring and almost useless. Even the "almost pleasant and credible moments" were immediately undermined by painful cliches and bad performances. Vernetta LÃ³pez and Wong Li Lin, whom I generally love, were only passable in this movie. It seemed that the director was trying to make a melodramatic remote control, then he let himself go and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with an RA rating (rated as horrible) but it has not changed my faith in local movies. More good movies will come, as long as there are no more movies like these.
