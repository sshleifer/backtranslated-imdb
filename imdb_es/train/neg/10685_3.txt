Predictable, trite and poorly written. I foolishly reasoned that such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit. I suppose the competition between actors is so intense these days (and it will only get worse) that one can no longer choose and choose. At first, they gave us an idea of ​​who was instrumental in the murder and since then we have attacked it. The film lacked intrigue, which gives us a small idea of ​​the victim and only a possible motive for the murder. Some of the speeches were, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone even considers, let alone committing, spending tens of millions of dollars to make this gut.
