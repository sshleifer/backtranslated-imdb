An illegal immigrant resists the system of social support that causes serious consequences for many. Well filmed and acted despite the fact that the story is a bit forced, however, the slow pace really draws the conclusion. The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively transmitted. The small person lost in the big society is something that we can all relate to, but I can not support the effort to see this movie.
