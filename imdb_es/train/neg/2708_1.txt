This film is passed off as a social commentary, when in reality it is as ridiculous as the racism it condemns. The premise of this film: African American = strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun against Omar Epps and a Jewish man. The Jewish man, in a stereotyped way, collapses with fear and begins to pray for his life ... but the big, strong and defiant Omar Epps remains strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of each member of the fraternity for being a prepuce or an arrogant rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins to consider lesbianism since, after all, she is only a weak white girl. When the nerdy white boy is rejected by the members of the fraternity, of course he must fall with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular man who is quickly defeated by strong black men. Wait ... BUSY RHYMES BEAT UP TO GUY TWICE YOUR SIZE ??? Yeah sure. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens its white roommates and keeps them online are simply stupid; Of course, he is the one who dominates, while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was terrible and the end made me laugh out loud. The too slow slow motion between Epps and Banks becomes funny with the faces they make, it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​making faces (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and avoid this crapfest.
