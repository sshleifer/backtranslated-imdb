Yes, even as a fan of programs such as survivor and apprentice, this program is pretty bad. I did not mind the first couple of shows, but then I realized how pathetic everyone was to go to the show in the first place. The antics of Alex and Aaron gave men a bad name for the way they cheated or abandoned their choice. At the first opportunity the show really did not look good. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. I had the most annoying voice I've heard on television, and I definitely was not the smartest girl (knowledgeable about the media, but I doubt there's much more). <br /> <br /> I have not really seen any of the programs since then, apart from the occasional repetition on daytime television. I think the TV reality point is to treat it as "entertaining garbage". Look at it as something you can laugh at, and do not have to think too much (I do not see CSI is like a reality tired of television and cliché, but you have to think too much while you watch it). <Br /> <br /> A couple of reflections on some reasons to go to the program. At the beginning, 'the woman tell all', a woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried in all the scenes, also in the bar and in the club, to meet a boy and it was not happening to her. Hello, Amy, how about you join a club, have a hobby, work for charity, change your work to one where you know more guys? All I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many of the other girls seemed obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting "the perfect man." Key to ladies: it does not exist. However, many great guys who would be excellent husbands, some of whom may be right for you! They may not earn six figures a year or look like a junior JFK, but they are good guys anyway. The woman in this show is pretty amazing, I'm still a young man, and they made me believe that The woman grew gradually as she grew as she grew older and became more realistic about her future partner. This show is demonstrating the opposite. <br /> <br /> In general, this show does much to confirm many stereotypes of how women see men in society. It really is a terrible show and I think all these types of shows should stop being performed. The best dating programs for a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. There is nothing more manned among the "couples" than a simple night out. The bachelor, unfortunately, takes himself too seriously.
