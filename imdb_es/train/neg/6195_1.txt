Bad deed Acting awful and an end that the Director seemed to think of nowhere, since the film frankly had not been so boring. Surprising that this film is considered for a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater had the same opinion as me: what was the point of even making the film? The references to Iraq were strange or simply had not been thought correctly. I'm surprised that this movie has been released, very, very disappointing and a waste of time. We are sorry, a very negative criticism, but I hope to dissuade some people from making the same mistake. Too bad we did not have a Q and A at the end of the movie, now that could have been interesting.
