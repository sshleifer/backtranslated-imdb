As usual, in IMDb, going through the majority vote instead of the "weighted average" is much more indicative of the entertainment value of the film. In this case, most give you a "one". What a reason they have! To begin my review, I will first admit that I have no idea why this movie is titled "Alien Intruder". It implies space and even a "stranger" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long term, at least, there is no basis of plot or real resolution that can be distinguished anywhere. <Br /> <br /> There are quite a lot of scenes that are so atrocious (with respect to lines, time and how they are spoken), which far surpasses the strange feeling that is felt when watching similar really bad movies. I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" only involves an area of ​​space known as Point G, I'm sorry, it creates that G-Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some kind of alien virus (? ). I think it's alien, since the image of Ariel, otherwise normal, appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> In most of the film, we see people being shot with space weapons, falling from dovecotes and seemingly endless. , useless shots close to "Where is Ariel?", "I can not find Ariel" (it does not make sense because most of the other shots INCLUDE interaction with Ariel, in any case, on a computer monitor). Commander Skyler (Billy Dee), sits and watches every fantasy of the VR programs of the convict hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took some courses on "how to act in despair" before filming this. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers over his face and looking sadly. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the nose of one boat entering the back of the other was almost hilarious. less, and provided a laugh in addition to the first scenes in which we see several shots of the ship, as it is spinning in a circle, much like a Lego experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? Even VR women are killed, as if that meant something (especially since everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I keep in the purchase, I'm not going to rant. about wanting to recover my money that I paid for the DVD of this. The dollar I kept in that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this critic's time. <br /> <br /> I will simply add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with many more details added, could probably be very interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
