Fixed (edited) from parts of a dead body (deleted scenes) of a corpse (Anchorman), the Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a show for sore eyes (something I would always want to see two Sometimes ... ... maybe even once for that matter. <br /> <br /> More often than not, the relativity of the scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third-person narrator. is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the opening narrative, they tell us that WURB takes place shortly after the original.) By the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown up. At the beginning of the film and embraced having a co-host / hybrid lover, in this film, she has returned to her immature pranks with jokes to Veronica (it is evident that these are more scenes of the original Anchorman spliced ​​in WURB). <br /> < br /> The part that does this a film, a story in continuous evolution, involves a clan that steals banks without a cause called an alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit on. This part was removed from the original Anchorman scripts. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted shots of the Anchorman scenes. They go to the same party as in the original scene, to the same original group "complaining about having a woman on the team," and to the same segment of the fashion show that Veronica refused to report. <br /> <br /> Burgundy returns to create his first appointment with the place where the drive-in is with view to San Diego and the dinner in his favorite club, Tinos. None of the characters mentions that he has been in the place where the car was driven before and when Burgundy enters Tinos with Veronica, he is presented as if they had never been before. Oh, and they are wearing the same clothes as in their original date. <br /> <br /> Still, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers, even if WURB is just a smart way to present deleted scenes. Tied with the narration. Between the two stories of Ron Burgundy, this is the weakest. Looking back, it is a great feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB. Stay with class, IMDb. Thanks for passing.
