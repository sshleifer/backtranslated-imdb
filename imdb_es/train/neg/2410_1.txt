Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films that these guys directed seem to have met and filmed this with their friends who have no talent one afternoon when they were bored (the lines are completely simple and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur films and 90% of home video images are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hey, let's see if someone is foolish enough to buy our movies." I wish nobody else was not. My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is a bit harsh, but I was the person who read their false reviews and bought the movie.
