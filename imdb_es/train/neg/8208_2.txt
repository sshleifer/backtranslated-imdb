"Hello everyone, I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thing from outer space, why do not we thaw it and open it?" "Yes, I know that that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be full of contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to Earth and could potentially kill the human race, but hey, I want to know what it contains." "And nobody says to NASA, they could take it from us." "Wow, this thing emits vibrations!" "Yes, really strong in contact, so do not touch it, but it's good to open it." "Hi guys, check out my nips." (Later, that day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Oh, we have to run to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have telephones, radios or intercoms, although we have equipment equivalent to a trillion dollars in other equipment. "I've never seen such an organic technology!" "Yes, let me take this stick and stab it." "I'm leaving here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, nobody is taking care of me!" "Look, they're the friendly aliens from" The Abyss! "They want us to go with them." THE END
