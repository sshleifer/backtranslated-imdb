If you like standard Sly movies that involve superior action, incredible tricks (incredible is not meant to be complementary here) and delayed dialogue; You will love this smoky pile of wild goat manure. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his "old days" to surrender to smarter people and make an action movie that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where history, setting and (credible) action would prevail. . I long for an action that is at least sufficiently close to reality so that I can imagine the fear and emotion that would arise from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculously ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know that when you enter the theater you will see a comic made in a movie. The character, the stage and everything else are incomparable with anything we can find. On the other hand, Cliffhanger turns a mountain climbing guide into Rambo before you can say "I, Adrian!"
