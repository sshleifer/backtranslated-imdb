Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read on the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who ignore or rule with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately this movie does not portray any of these. What is shown is a piece of propaganda with many fingers that greet and point. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and the period of time, but the very essence of George Orwell's novel lacks deeply. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how not to adapt a Not a novel or are simply interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novel and then look by all means. I just found this to be somewhat mediocre. However, only the opinion of a man. <br /> <br /> The remake is a notch below, but not much.
