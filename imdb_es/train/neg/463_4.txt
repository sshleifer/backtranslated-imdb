Blonde and Blonder were not comfortable. Basically, it was a Dumb and Dumber version for girls, but less fun, and they used too much background noise and music. It starts immensely boring, and FULLY insane. It does not accelerate anywhere soon, and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense continued. Maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes. I found it entertaining and interesting as it got closer to the end, but that was the only part. Also, I could not help it, but I liked the characters of Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard a little. Even though this movie did not have any laughter from me, it caught my attention. I would not say you avoid this movie altogether, but there are thousands of better movies for you to spend your time and money on than Blonde and Blonder.
