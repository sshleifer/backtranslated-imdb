I went to this film waiting for a concise film that would relate the effect that the Son of Sam had on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me to feed on more trash in racial tension, popular justice or the inability of ordinary citizens to make a decision under pressure from their peers.

This is not an escapist movie.
