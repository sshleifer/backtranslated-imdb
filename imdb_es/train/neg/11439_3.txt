It was obvious that this movie is designed to attract the audience of Chick Flick, to which I have sat through a few and that I have enjoyed the most. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying as hell). Her performance was exaggerated and she seemed to be too anxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more, since there was a budget adequate for the scenarios, the actors and a decent story. My wife and I agreed that this was 'Muck' in the end, since the film ended in a painful and embarrassing high! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham will adhere to the kind of movies she belongs to as From Hell.
