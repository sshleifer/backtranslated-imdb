I do not know why they watch Steven Seagal's films, but I see them because, fools as they are, at least they're always good for laughing. Why would I rate this movie 1 out of 10 based on dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a film like this one a cult favorite that you can laugh at for being stupid? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was as worthy as a Steven Seagal vehicle like many of his other movies; In fact, I did not think it was one of his worst moments. He had, most of the time, a coherent mid-course storyline, and was, most of the time, fundamentally exciting. The end really sucked, but even that had some pleasantly trashy elements. In the end, the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but I actually thought that the interpretation, the characterization (if I can use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​provided exactly what a true Steven fan Seagal would wait. Seagal, in particular, was exactly the man of stone-faced man and no nonsense that we have come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed it up quite well, without having raised it on stage. This, people, is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with him. Or even better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
