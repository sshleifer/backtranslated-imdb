The fight scenes were great. I loved the old and new cylons and how they painted the ones on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was land but 150 thousand years ago. But traveling all that way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38 thousand people who fought for their own existence and once they reach paradise, do they abandon technology? No way. Surely they were eating paper and rationing food, but that's over. They can live like humans again. They only have a good doctor. What will they do when someone hurts a tooth, it does not matter to give birth ... yes? Nobody would have made that choice.
