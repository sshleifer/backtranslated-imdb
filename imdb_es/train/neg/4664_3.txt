I voted 3 for this movie because it looks very good like the whole Greenaways exit. However, it was his usual mix of "art", sex and pretentious shit. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I got tired of it VERY quickly. Definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the role for credibility reasons, I suppose, but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to send someone to the corner of Pseud, but please ... On the positive side, it is visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music, but I could not see it until the end and I can not say that in many movies. I usually see all this but this is unbearable !!
