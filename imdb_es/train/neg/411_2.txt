Normally I do not feel much incentive to comment on movies that I do not like, but in a case like this, I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many flaws in the narrative that I do not even feel obliged to give more details because it is time for me to move from this experience. However, the most annoying point is that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations of the Bacon character's madness are due to a trip of power or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> Granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good things (the Robocop director's DVD version is great). However, this film is stupid and, in general, it does not come close to explaining the point or the technical aspect of the subject, and in its place it is satisfied with a predictable action without any kind of enjoyment. <br /> <br /> In summary, like many other reviews Here say (I wish I had read before ...) - Get away from this movie!
