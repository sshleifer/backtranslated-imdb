This piece of fecal matter combined adds so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end it is a laugh of absolute hilarity. Pity that the premise is promising (as it often happens in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this screenwriter is directed to the land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving a sentence for a DUI that killed his lover. We can see him having nightmares just so we know he feels really BAD for this. Then his neighbor cellmate hangs up. Or the? Lowe has some suspicions but abandons them quickly. Their suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. Then, why do they put him to kill? Ah, that's where this story could get interesting. That's where he falls off the rails, and once he's off the rails, decides he can get away with insulting the attention of the spectators during the next numb hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************ *** <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with an endless recount Of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplate this ending. Lowe has been caught by the bad guys on a train. They want a tape that he has, because that tape will ruin his boss and them. So in the train come 3 policemen, with weapons drawn, ready to rescue Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops, in front of half the passengers and then ... they continue chasing Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! Killing 3 policemen in public will take you to a deep doodo, to hell with the tape. However, they go to a mall to photograph the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end, Lowe is taken and the bad guy still wants the tape!
