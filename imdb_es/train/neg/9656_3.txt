This movie is made for the smell of television everywhere. However, it started with great intentions, presenting sets of excellent looks and accessories and authentic costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a horrible dialogue in the nose, and he hurried to broadcast a melodramatic television. The characters were so foolish that sometimes I thought they were about to degenerate into a bilious pool of goo, and the action was so complicated and so badly cut that it seemed that the soldiers were simply standing and taking turns firing at each other. The Germans were represented so unrealistically that it was painful to see them. The only thing the German officers talked about was how wonderful Americans are. Please, take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie sucks. However, this DVD has an excellent additional feature, which covers the frontline cards of World War I, which makes this rent not a total waste of my time.
