After having seen Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second, I finally had the opportunity to watch his sequel Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed, as it was not up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets in the head is not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's score for this had neither the beauty nor the correlative strength of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film seemed slow and useless. A diluted version of Baraka, which is the same idea but is made better. I really hope that the third film in this series does not follow the example of this waste.
