There's a good movie lurking here, but it's not this. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral problems that a group of young survivors of the apocalypse would face. But logic is so confusing that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about the capture of the mysterious aerial contagion that has eliminated almost all of humanity. However, they use surgical masks sometimes, not others. Sometimes they are fans of cleaning with bleach any area that an infected person touches. Other times, they seem totally carefree. <br /> <br /> Worse, having apparently survived a few weeks or months in this new world of killing or being killed, these people constantly behave like new beings. They do not bother to accumulate adequate equipment or food. They are running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not take elementary precautions when encountering strangers. And after crossing the rotten corpses of the entire human race, they are as delicate as the protected debutantes. You have to constantly ask yourself how they could have survived so long ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> Then, when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral. The dimensions of his actions, it is impossible to take seriously his search for the soul. Your actions should first have some kind of minimal sense. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, we must deal with Chris Pine's dubious acting skills. His portrayal of a young and arrogant James T Kirk might have seemed clever, when he is seen isolated. But in Carriers he plays exactly that same note: arrogant and with a bone head. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his full dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie * looks * excellent. It looks too sharp and saturated that really adapts to the regional configuration of the Southwest of the USA. UU But that can not save the truly weak writing nor the thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end of the world genre, you should save yourself the agony of seeing Carriers.
