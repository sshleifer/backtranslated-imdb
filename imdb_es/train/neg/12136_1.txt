I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and I can not see how anyone can sit through this piece of garbage. It's not funny at all and take your I.Q. Down some notches. I know this movie is for children, but that does not mean that writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and thought that a) The word "poop" is equal to a great laugh. b) A four-foot-tall child can dive into a ten-foot-tall basketball net. c) Children must always fight against kidnappers armed with weapons because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all it takes to hit the so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the weakest suburban "gang" in the world that could not scare anyone. Maybe the MST3K guys could use this movie to laugh. Do not bother with this excuse for a movie.
