I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and extensive! It was not funny at all. The audience just sat through the whole movie and did not laugh at all! Not even the children laughed !! That's sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they could have found someone better to play the Martian instead of Christopher Lloyd! It was really stupid! And it was not funny! I thought the talking suit was really silly !!! In the original television series the costume does not speak and moves! In my opinion, they should not have wasted their time in this movie !! I give it two thumbs down !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone! Thank you!!
