I understand that I'm reviewing the movie I've seen. I realize that practically all the nudity and blood were cut from this movie, neutralizing it completely. Seeing names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I was not going to have a horror classic, but at least I expected free piqueros and bloodshed. But no, this has to be the most massacred modern horror movie, I mean it's easy to say that there are many more things in certain scenes, but suddenly they are cut off, or the scene just ended as it is. How do you ruin a cannibal and a porn star? I want to say that this is a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with an executive's wife or something, because it's literally amazing how much was eliminated from this. When I read about this a few years ago at Fangoria, I was excited, it seemed like a funny movie, but unfortunately the real movie is locked in a vault somewhere, and we have to put up with this piece of excrement renamed Evil Breed. We hope that a cut without qualification someday will be published, since I believe that a good film exists in this mess, but until that moment it is better that it seizes a pack of twelve Bud, because that is the only way in which it will be able to surpass this film.
