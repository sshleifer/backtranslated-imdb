What a sad vision these television fans are doing, running the clock in their careers, stumbling over a small ship - boat hull could be more appropriate. All production feels cheap and in disrepair, and is not helped by a "big name" star that is barely able to spit the few lines it has credibly delivered. <br /> <br /> At no time plaster support above the material; They are clearly looking at the clock here. Expel the scenes, get the paycheck, go home and try to forget it completely. <br /> <br /> It is not especially badly written or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's completely bland, and it's shot in a very limited number of small sets with a small cast of extras. The rhythm is a bit strange; a shamefully tentative romantic subplot only starts after the main action begins, which makes it feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage gets a couple of points for being qualified competently, and for being a fun game to "detect Kiwi bit parters"; the majority of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this movie probably constitutes his great opportunity.
