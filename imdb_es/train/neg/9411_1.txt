It's interesting that all those who (until now) seemed to like this movie had no expectations, I guess that's the trick. In contrast to them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the camera faces were, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director; that's always a clear signal from them, they think it's artistic, effective or intense to hold the camera. about two inches away from the actors. The actors in this movie, however, had only one facial expression each. <br /> <br /> If the nearby camera was not enough, the lack of light in the movie killed him. The movie seemed to be completely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the director of photography was also a rank amateur. "Ooh ooh, let's light up the set with a flashlight, that will make everything look intimate!" No, that made everything seem invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the slightest hint of an idea that had never been developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was enlightened (Maybe this is a new type of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget it). <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won a couple of awards at film festivals does not indicate the quality of the film. Film, but blemish the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this movie will not win anything at the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film it seemed like it was finally over and people started getting up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the "total darkness" technique of the cinematograph). But when the film shuddered, however, there were moans coming from the audience. And once the movie finally ended, it became clear that it had not mattered if it had really ended in either of the two previous points. An earlier ending would have saved the audience from even more monotonous scenes of domesticity (bending leaves, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we understand, the life of the lonely old man was boring, but we realized that from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the audience be lost, it has absolutely nothing to offer. Sophisticated moviegoers.
