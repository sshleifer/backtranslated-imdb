This film is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) who tries to catch a very smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company run by Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever the plan, the police try to get the thief to know them in advance. This movie, covered by handsome main actors, beautiful main actress and good shots of scenes from Hong Kong, really does not have any substance. It's all flash, and the flash quickly gets boring too. I lost all interests a third of the way in the movie, and after that there is no redemption quality, except for cinematography, which looks good. Just consider watching this movie if you can do it for free. Also, consider not watching the movie 20 minutes after the movie because it is all the same until the end: BORING. 6/10
