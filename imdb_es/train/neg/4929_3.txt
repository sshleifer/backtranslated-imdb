The spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this disguise of melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and shot dead at the end. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, called "The life and death of the evil Lady Skelton" (I guess people did not). (Complain about the spoilers back then), it was written by a woman, a brat from the English navy who had problems or was cynical or both. Your heroine is devastating and beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things do matter, like the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and unique response when someone gets in her way is homicide. She murders three men in five attempts. A fatal woman, she has a case of disocial personality disorder that should have led her to Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood interprets her as a narcissistic vamp, using so much makeup that I thought of her as Joan Rivers of the Restoration era (or Joan Rivers of the restoration era, ha!). However, Lady B. is irresistible to the three main male characters: Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all of whom do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, the three fans quickly realize what a psychotic bitch is, Barbara, but the plot keeps everyone in her orbit until one of them finally shoots her, accidentally, in what is intended to be irony or simply desserts. Given the dramatic scene of death with a boom that lifts the camera through the windows and into the sky, I guess we're supposed to be condemned by his death. But she is the first corpse that does not matter to us.
