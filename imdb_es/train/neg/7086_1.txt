This movie was so amateur that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It's filmed on VIDEO! No movie I have not seen anything like that since the early 70s, when the nightly networks showed the movie of the week recorded in the video of "horror movies". It seems like a bad telenovela, and that's a compliment. Some of the actors give their best. Michael Des Barres agrees with what he is asked to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. I can not say it's nice to see. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski, while the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. I can not blame her for the poor blocking of another person, but she is totally amazing in her role. Your little girl's voice works against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. She certainly is not old and exotic, but she's out of reach with this. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically upset. Each line she delivers is with three exclamation marks. Someone must have ordered him to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a furious woman? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette, as the sweet and defamed wife, goes well, and probably the most credible of all. But that does not say much. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst movie I've seen in years.
