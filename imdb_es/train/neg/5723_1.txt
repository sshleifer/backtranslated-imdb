Anyone who has said that it is better than the Hostel is talking completely, believe me, I am not a Hostel fan, but this is ridiculous. This is just another photo on the camcorder, directly on a DVD, with little idea of ​​wasting your time, I can not believe how many of these movies there are and I have not yet seen a decent one. In the 80s, horror, gore and horror films were made without a budget, but with a great history and a lot of new ideas and, most importantly, the heart and soul of the director who had something to say . Now it seems that they are being pumped in an attempt to deceive the people who sail in Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this, so I think these movies will continue to appear. This movie is so sparse of ideas that it's just amazing how it was made, the acting is also terrible, the location is not very convincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that you can not believe it. This waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female character points a gun at someone and threatens to shoot her if she does not back off, you can see she's not even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the button. grip. An absolute joke.
