The first time I appeared on Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the movie lasted. I was surprised by the length. Both animated and horror films share a common ground: the attention span of the selected audience and that should be around 90 minutes. Something else, and you will lose most of your audience. <br /> <br /> These 110 minutes, or 20 minutes after their peak, were a big problem for me. I would like to say that half of this movie could have been edited, but it would be too generous to say that. Go ahead, look at it and tell me how many scenes could have been edited, even without being a great film specialist. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the visit that stayed too long, the movie was below average. He spent all his time trying to be this great mystery in which the "elite 10" is killing the remaining friends. For the most part, they not only exaggerate it, but they focus on one face and say "It's this guy! No! It's this girl!" You will spend more time with the camera deceiving you than enjoying the movie. And do not make me start with acting. <br /> <br /> Well, that got me started. At first I had to laugh trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that went blind in Little House on the Prairie (later, the investigation showed that my suspicions were correct) because throughout this movie, she really seemed blind. Strange, as an established actress, she should have been the best of the group, but it turned out to be the worst. The rest of the staff, apart from Ann (Bregman) was also pretty bad, but she, uh, took the cake. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a group of ten friends, and one dies immediately. off. Almost nobody thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue on their happy path. Slowly, then more quickly, there are revelations about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past and her psychologist, who is a bit more personal (AND ON THE CALL 24/7, apparently) than most of the shrunken. Meanwhile, more and more deaths are occurring. <br /> <br /> What is funny is that, like the first "disappearance", the more "better buds" fade away, the less the rest worries. Sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say "Wow, (that person) just would not run away", etc., but then they return to their sexual forms. And speaking of that, it's probably due to the horrible script, or maybe it was me who lost interest in the 30th minute, but it was very difficult to follow who liked who in the group, since they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or Someone would be frightened of MAX by another and better friends in the next scene. SEE: the creepy guy who had a mouse / rat in his pocket? literally And it was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much credit (and time), but how it became part of the "elite 10", I'll never know. <br /> <br /> But, I'm in a rage, there's a mystery here. Why are these children's goals? Why does Virginia think she has killed someone, when it was never shown (until the end) that some of them have really been killed? And why does the trailer and the poster say that these murders are "Six of the strangest murders you'll ever see"? Hell, even by 1981, most of these had shown up on either of the first two Friday 13th movies? Coincidentally, on Friday the 13th the second part was launched 2 days before the happy birthday. Maybe they're talking about when they filmed it months before, but they were late for the party, well. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you will have to rewind 3 -4x to get really ridiculous and incoherent reasons, and even then, put the subtitles to get all the murmurs of the victims / murderers Even if you get the first time, it's an incredibly scandalous and hilarious ending. It's almost worth watching the whole movie again, but like a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday meeting should be avoided. Is it a first draft of a horrible and illogical script? Please keep in mind that several rewrites are needed before the role of the camera, it can be low or extreme action and it is 100% unrealistic in how people react in extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side note: When I was a child, or say 10-11 years, I loved horror movies. (I still do, curiously, definitive guilty pleasures, but they are becoming harder to see as the years pass). We got our first VCR, and I recorded so many horror movies outside the network (or EDITED VERSIONS) of TV. All I remember about Happy Birthday to Me is having the last 10 minutes on a tape, which scared me so much. And, obviously, it revealed the great mystery about who was the killer. Although I've seen other clips of this movie, I think this is the first full view I've had. Fortunately, this horrible movie did not hurt me as a child. I'm older now, and I can take this garbage. But never again. <br /> <br /> Side Note 2: That said, that crazy song "Happy Birthday to Me" that plays in the final credits (and as a score in everything) still scares me greatly. I guess this movie (or the last few minutes) had an influence on my childhood. What a shame, Melissa Sue Anderson!
