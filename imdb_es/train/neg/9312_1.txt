The worst movie on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can prevent another person from being punished with this movie. When it comes to acting and enlightening, this movie is similar to a bad movie without sex. The actors are some of the worst I've seen, and they could not have been worse, even if they were trying to make a total mockery of this movie. The film must have had a low budget record, which I'm sure was almost entirely wasted on the cover of the film. This movie has now become a joke to run with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. I would like to point out that no other movie starts to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to a friend and me that they watch this movie and I am surprised that I still consider myself a friend after the torment we went through. I do not see this movie!
