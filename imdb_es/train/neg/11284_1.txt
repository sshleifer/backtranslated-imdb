I usually try to build reasonably well-argued reviews of the movies, but I can not believe that this has passed the stage of the script. The dialogue is frightening, the performance is very unreliable, the accents are horrible, and the direction and pace are scarce at best. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the last time I saw such a bad movie. Joseph Fiennes, as beautiful as he is, could have killed his career as fast as it started. <br /> <br /> Doctor Moreau's Island was no worse than this garbage.
