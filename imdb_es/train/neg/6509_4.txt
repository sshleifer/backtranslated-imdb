Sean Bean is great, just like the photography, the location and the costumes. However, the plot is somewhat confusing, and the conclusion is flat. The plot has been altered SUBSTANTIALLY from Cornwell's novel, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better to read than observed. Sharpe was too narrow here, in contrast to his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is shot down by a "real" officer, and after a brief pause and a piercing look, he drives back the startled and frightened officer. He sets the tone for his later judgments as commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" of "10".
