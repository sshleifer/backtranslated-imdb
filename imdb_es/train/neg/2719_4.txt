When a small space-age balloon, a silly putty lands on earth, it soon begins to consume earthlings and grows fatter. The only part of this nonsensical nonsense that I enjoyed were all great classic cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. Did this thing really make 20 million dollars? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were very overpaid. The 'monster' looked very much like a large bag of beans and the 'teenagers' seemed to have children approaching their teenage years. And those shots from the shotgun; It sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. The ending was pitifully trite; Obviously, the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel ... and there were many. Thumbs down.
