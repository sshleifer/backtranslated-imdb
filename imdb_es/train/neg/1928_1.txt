How the Grinch stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas caricature that anyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a new version made with humans, the caricature was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this movie? But it also seemed a little strange that Jim Carrey was the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but he like the Grinch? It just did not make any sense to me. His performance was a little exaggerated and, without wanting to, he laughed at some moments. Not to mention that some of the added dialogues were a bit childish and not pleasant. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was finished and it was not necessary. Actually, they just destroyed the story, period. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is preparing for their best Christmas season, however, everything is destined to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and concerned about the Grinch who lives above them and who is not going to have a Christmas as good as the other's. He throws it out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that, in fact, he should steal Christmas all together to show who his Christmas version is about. But soon he realizes that he who knows may be a little more than the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> How the Grinch Stole Christmas was not necessary and it was a bit exaggerated. I really recommend that you limit yourself to the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a very disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The makeup and the presentation of the whole movie were a little over, not to mention that How the Grinch stole Christmas! I was more destined to be like a caricature instead of a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you feel grateful for the version of Boris Karloff that is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
