Leaving aside all the buzz of the internet, this movie was horrible. I hoped the movie was more of a farce than anything else. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious suspense / horror movie, and missed it. There were only a few good parts, and a couple of good lines from Samuel Jackson. Apart from that, it was a lot of blood and some poorly animated snakes. All the jokes on the internet were much better than the real movie. Now that the movie has come out, I hope this joke dies. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk about promoted. If you are looking for something fun and entertaining, go to Serpientes in a blog.
