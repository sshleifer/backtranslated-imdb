I must admit that I do not have a lot of mumbo jumbo of the New Age. When people "exchange energy", I always wonder how much is actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the problem of global warming. When the energy "is applied", I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and they are still without the Nobel prizes. When people feel that instinct allows them to navigate without problems through the complexities of life, I wonder how they can not do something as simple as finding the train station. <br /> <br /> But, again, this is not the first movie. With holes in the plot and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with "The Celestine Prophecy" I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems to be bored with his head and unable to understand what he is supposed to be doing in the place. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with someone who really knows what he is talking about and intends to understand. <br /> <br /> The address is not inspired either. You may expect something more from the guy who did "What dreams can come", but hey, I guess he received a good payment for work and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, friend ..." . Only one who seems to be having fun is the bad guy of all time, JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, but he is one of the few actors in this movie that can have some cracks wise in this eternal and terribly boring New Age talk. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar to one of these dinner dates when you discover that your date is really a horrible boredom that seems to be unable to shut up. At one point in time, it seems that the words turn into little ping pong balls that are thrown at your head incessantly until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this film and sticking safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
