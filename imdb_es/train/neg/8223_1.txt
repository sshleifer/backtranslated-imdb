Definitely, definitely the worst movie I've seen in my life, no questions! The contradictors of this opinion could argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as the others, since it is an independent and low budget film, but okay? Amateurism and poor innovation are horrifying. <br /> <br /> Agree with everything that has been said about this movie, for example, the mind is very weak acting (when it is so bad that you try again to film the scene, damn it). What bothered me the most was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming that such thing existed during production. There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect to the spectators, the girls changed their personality several times and seemed to show absolutely no singing of rationality, not even brains: five relatively fit girls against a female psychopath? do gangs with her, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered as a conquest of this title is that the camera does not leave the truck at any time, so the viewer sees everything from Inside, which is, like the rest of the movie, a good idea executed in an excruciatingly terrible way. <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, is this movie NOT ANYTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a handheld camera? This is an effect and not a trait! Used intelligently it can be impressive, but in this case it is an excuse for inappropriate cinematography.
