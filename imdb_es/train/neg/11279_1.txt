Words really can not describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that had some good shots and the occasional moment of stroking his chin here and there to keep you from falling asleep. This is just ridiculous! Terrible script, bad direction, bad acting and you know what? I can not think of a single thing to recommend other than the fact that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, book at the dentist and do a root canal treatment job: much nicer and much better value for money (assuming you need it!). By the way, I need to write 10 lines of text to complete this revision. PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT'S TERRIBLE!
