Too much superfluous material and things like the bad boss who seemed to have escaped from The Phantom of the Opera did not help. The whole sequence of 'The Night of the Living Dead' was extremely silly and quite unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish someone for their sins, do they now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again?
