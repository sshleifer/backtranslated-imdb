I just visited the Russian forum of our television channel that had shown this movie. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more real facts of our spatial achievements in this movie. But the authors had something else in mind ... :( We are a great and beautiful country with smart people who live here.We are proud of all our spatial dreams, real achievements, on the one hand, in this field and in science, for On the other hand, I would like to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, hell, is our MIR station? Ah, I am pretty sure that LUNOHOD events took place long before "Walk on Moon" Armstrong, and to comment on numerous technical comments and scientific errors: I really do not have time or enough space here!
