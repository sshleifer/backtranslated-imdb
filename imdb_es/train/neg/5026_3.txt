Call inside, call outside. That seems to be Gammera in a few words, a prehistoric creature that can take it and distribute it with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I ended up committed to watching all the films in Mill Creek / Treeline Films' collection of fifty science fiction movies on DVD. It has a great value of about twenty-five dollars, so at fifty cents per movie, it really comes down to an investment in time to see some of the ridiculous offers. <br /> <br /> Gammera is furious with a long sleep of centuries. for a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, it takes place in Tokyo and sets the United Nations in motion to try to devise a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and they would not know it, there is a scene in which there is a huge shed called the 'Z Plan' building; That was a good touch. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1960s, this country was still not politically correct. One of the American military scenes in the Alaska Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a sergeant to make coffee. I guess there was no private around. <br /> <br /> The good old Gammera was pretty easy to see, walking on two legs and betting on the routine of the flame throw when challenged. That's why I was surprised how Plan Z managed to capture the turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden spacecraft, taking it to Mars to save the world. Great players for the American and Russian team that saved, now let's go back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera generated at least a good dozen movies, but having seen this pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, turtles in flames. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier has "Attack of the Monsters" with a special appearance of the Big G. It took everything I had to get to the end of both films; It was a great relief to get to the final table in this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara! "
