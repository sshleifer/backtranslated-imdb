This was a movie I hoped to be able to suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to see the film to finish, I knew I could not even see the damn thing close. You're almost convinced that the real war did not last that long. Other's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this. But you can not go from seeing Save Ryan to LOC. Forget the difference in the budget of the film or the audience, that does not stop a director from making a smart movie. The duration of the film is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive: they continue attacking the same hill but they give different names. I thought the LOC was terrible terrain, this hill looked like my backyard. The sequences of development of the characters (the flashbacks of the soilders, remembering their last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the film and not only grouped in a long memory. To this day, I still have to see the end. But there was a much better movie (without saying much) called Border.
