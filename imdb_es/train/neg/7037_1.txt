This is truly a horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is at the same time insipid and offensive, with nudity and a lot of violence. However, nudity is not that exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. In addition, the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and underdeveloped, and the performance is one of the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie is supposed to be fun, but it's not. I did not laugh even once while I looked at him, I did not even smile. The creators of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and failed in both aspects. <br /> <br /> Some bad movies are fun because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
