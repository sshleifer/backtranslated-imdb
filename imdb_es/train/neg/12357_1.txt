I will be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with an IQ at room temperature. I feel liberal, feminist, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They can forget about the draft or be in combat too. It will not happen. You see, however difficult it is to understand or accept it, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that it is 2007, reality can not change things so that people avoid their feelings being harmed. Men can not give birth or breastfeed babies (Oh, I forgot San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or the NHL? Finally, I could not give you a damn cry in hell if what I just wrote bothers you. Think about it: if this bothers you, that only warms my heart more. I did not write a thing that was not the truth. This imbecile movie is just a comedy and lousy.
