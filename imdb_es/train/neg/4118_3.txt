While we were navigating the canal, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed by the flat performance, and the plot made. We found the explosions of the car scenes fun, incredible shootings, and sets that crashed with the weight of foam strips and cardboard. What was even more fun was to see all the recycled scenes of "Dante's Peak", where the front of the church falls on the school bus, the fronts of the stores are separated from the main street, the overpass collapses and the truck Red hurries down the alley while the bricks fall on him. It was a good laugh, though unintentional, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally a parody of low-budget disaster films.
