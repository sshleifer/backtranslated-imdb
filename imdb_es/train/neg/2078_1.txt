Yesterday I went to see this movie and, although I did not have much hope in this movie, I was still very disappointed! In fact, I can not believe that I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad! The plot was shameful and the acting was terrible (although it had big names like Uma Thurman). This movie relied heavily on its special effects ... but personally they had no effect on me. Honestly, I wish they had never seen it and I warn everyone not to watch this movie. It is a total waste of money and then you will be disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, pamper yourself, do not go see this movie ... You will live to regret it!
