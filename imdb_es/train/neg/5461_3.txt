Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate almost all the episodes as if they were the best programs in history. While several of them are really wonderful classics, the truth is that in each major episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank. However, like the staunch Trekkies, these lovers of the Zone insist that they are all gold. In fact, this is what initially made me review some individual episodes of a cult series instead of the movies I usually watch. <br /> <br /> While this is not the worst episode ever made or among the worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. A widow observes a long procession of Civil War soldiers passing through her house. In the end, an unexpected turn is revealed and there is not much excitement or suspense here.
