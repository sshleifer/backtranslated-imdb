Dolph Lundgren plays a templar who arrives in New York when an archaeologist finds a key that unlocks the antichrist. Of course, the devil is only a couple of miles behind Dolph and he does not kill himself so easily when he transfers from one body to another. body. (Like Fallen without the suspense) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely impossible to see. I admit that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I try to watch their movies when they are on television. I caught the Minion and the boy disappointed me. This movie is absolutely terrible. With action sequences so poorly organized and poorly edited, it can hardly have coherent meaning in the field of struggle. Worst of all is Lundgren's pitiful and unconvincing performance as a hard-guy priest! All of this made the movie a scam of Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad but better than this). ) in general This movie is the worst movie I've seen of Dolph Lundgren. Literally has nothing to recommend it. It's horrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters of the Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * From 4 (horrible)
