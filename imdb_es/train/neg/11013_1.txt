I like bad movies, but this has NOTHING about that. Despite what previous idiots have said, it's NOT funny. I know comedy and clandestine movies, but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be banned from ever directing anything other than access to the local cable. Loving movies and comedy is to despise this movie. Maybe it will never get over how little fun and boring this job was. If you like this movie, you are a big fan of sobriety, there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the old John Waters. The film begins by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUN, you can say or do SOMETHING, but if it's NOT fun, you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic and this movie is just not fun. ZERO!
