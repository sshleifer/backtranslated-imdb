As big actors as a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and is a horrible character, the movie is not funny at all, you can see a subconscious message "IT IS A BAD MALICIO !!!", "I AM MUCH WRONG !!", "AFTER YOUR TELEVISION THROUGH WINDOW, "and soon. It's just disgusting and annoying. In addition to the absurd plot, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it could cause epilepsy. Usually, I do not care about the decoration in the movie, but this "Free Money" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free money", probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer gets nothing! He looks at the cost of sanity.
