Probably the worst movie in New Zealand ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes are not funny. Used from other movies and simply corny. The acting is bad, although there is a great cast. <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and boring. It has more cheese, pizza, huts, cheese lovers, pizza, like acting. 1,000 times before <br /> <br /> I saw it when it appeared on TV, but it was so boring that I could only stand 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Do not see it, <br /> <br /> Look at the dry paint instead
