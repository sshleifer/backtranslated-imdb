It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was in the geeky fashion words, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch more of the big-body giants if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, but just as sinister. I seriously doubt that ANY body really kills someone directly; Even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
