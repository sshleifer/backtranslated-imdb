I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark and avant-garde film environment for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start with the performance. None of that is really that good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But that does not say much. It's good at first sight, and then you realize what it is, a bodybuilder who turns out to be a tolerable actor. But mainly the problem is that Batman does not belong to the light of day, it looks like a monster running in a bat costume. Instead of a horribly scared man trying to make up for past mistakes. Daylight also reveals an irritating scowl on Bartram's face that never goes away and can be seen in Batman: Dead End, probably due to the darkness of how brief it is desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that frowning and stubbornly denying his head is acting, it is not, it is just the opposite. It's called posing, something that real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collora chose bodybuilders as leaders. It makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can handle it, rather than a bodybuilder who can handle it, but HEY HAVE LOOKED AS MUCH AS THE COMIC! Of course, they could have done better if the Collora dialogue did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The full trailer (yes, trailer, there will not be a full length movie) is more centered around Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is cheesy, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've seen in my life. He stops around, smiles, says his lines. That is all. Although it does not surprise me since he is just a bodybuilder that they hired and possibly received some acting lessons. Once again I tell Collora, cast ACTORS. No bodybuilders. The actors will be much more convincing than we will forgive the fact that they do not exactly look like comics. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you expect Superman to wear. As for the batman suit. Well, I guess it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some shots the costume looks like something you would buy at a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But that's not a good thing. These shots seem especially amateurish. This and much of the whole "movie" seems to be filmed in his backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a picture of Superman catching a car in his hands. And the final shot of Two-Face and Batman at the end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only I could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why, if you try to show your ability as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? This does not prove anything when it comes to being a real story director. My only advice for Collora here is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End was not fond of it. I can not figure out where this went wrong.
