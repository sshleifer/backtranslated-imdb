Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house where she grew up, where she recently inherited from her deceased sister, without the knowledge of her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in her. Jennifer decides to sell it because she has a great need for money to displease her grandmother. She also begins to have problematic recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. There really was no one to relate to in this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental and narcissistic, while Grandma seemed spiteful, sad and also narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but without anyone to empathize with, it was difficult for me to worry about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
