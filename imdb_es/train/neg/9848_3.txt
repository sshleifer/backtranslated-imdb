This film has some excellent noirish / neorealist visual effects, and tells a story that is incredibly free of the Hollywood sugarcane, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes last too long (especially the wedding), and I found that the exaggerated performance and the unrealistic dialogue are more suitable for the stage than for the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly annoying, and it seemed to get worse as the movie progressed. Most of the characters were Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants who lived in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while mixing cement and laying bricks. Towards the end I laughed, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to do it. I suppose the trench poetry could defend itself by saying that the characters would have been speaking in Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would actually speak. But it absolutely did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly acquires a charming love. British accent. I'm just guessing that this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower note for execution.
