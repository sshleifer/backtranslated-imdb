I can not believe that this was the worst movie I've ever seen. I laughed a couple of times. (probably because of how stupid it was) If someone paid me to watch that movie again, I would not. The plot was so horrible, it did not make sense, and the acting was so bad that I could not even tell if they were trying. that movie was terrible rating: f
