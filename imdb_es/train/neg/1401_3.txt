Someone mentioned the edition. This was poorly edited and what started as intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. To begin, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best options for the type of experimentation they are involved in? And, what are you testing exactly? Apparently there is a great plan that some agency will exploit. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone is getting excited. Everyone is keeping secrets. They often mention that if it were not for the money, they would hang it. There is a deranged minister who spits out writing. Unceasingly. But, once again, the biggest problem is the lack of establishing a playing field for the actors. There are some very cheesy elements. Those little rooms and those loungers. The horrible wallpaper (was wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it did not seem to go anywhere.
