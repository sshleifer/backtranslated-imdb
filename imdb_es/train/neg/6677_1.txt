After reading the first 5 comments on IMDb, I was very excited about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the performance is exaggerated in the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> <br /> The story does not seem to go in one direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years they finally succeed), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even They want to free him (why the hell did they capture him?). Then the bride, who is acting is the most exaggerated, she wants to get away from this madness, then, suddenly, she does not do it, then again, she does it and then she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the entire human race (and remember, in all those years, no other human has seen these aliens permanently settled) and what do they do? They torture him and blow up a lot of aliens peacefully. <br /> <br /> This is my first comment on IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very soon, so listen to my warning: this is not worth moving, do not watch this movie.
