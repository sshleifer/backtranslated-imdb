This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pyun made in 1993, and it's the bad one. Apparently, all his energy went to "Nemesis", which was an entertaining and entertaining movie and had a much more expensive aspect. The "Knights" are clumsy and cheesy, a science fiction background that resembles a video game (the new opponents appear all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the wastebasket is Kathy Long; She is not a particularly attractive woman, but certainly a brutally efficient combat machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering her age at that time (58), I hope her double has been well paid. (* 1/2)
