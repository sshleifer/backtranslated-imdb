I like animated shows. I really enjoy Nick's rate, including Hey, Arnold. But passing a television program to the big screen is not easy and this just did not feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it just did not move that well. Judging by the behavior of the children we had with us, it did not fare so well either.
