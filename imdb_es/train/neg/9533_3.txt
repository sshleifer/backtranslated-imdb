A prologue text warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house, but I think the most appropriate word is "entropy". What a pity, how sordid are these two babies! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his San Francisco office and in his monstrously expensive house in Tiburon while his wife and son are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on their door, asking directions. Well, it's raining, and they're shaking like two pitiful, soaked kittens, and they're not sure of the direction they're looking for, and, with one thing and another, George invites them in and partake of their pizza by the fire. The three end up in George's bath tub and continue approximately five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quad exposure and dodeakakuple exposure. They spend the night in a trio and the next morning the girls prepare their breakfast. But something has become a little crazy because Georgie's guests eat everything with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup on all the clothes and "Eat like ANIMALS!", George exclaims and tells them to leave. In your dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces like a super ball. You must say that they raise them very nice down there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they also raise them with great effort, as we can not help but notice after the first five or ten minutes. <Br /> <br /> But when girls go crazy, so does the movie. The film is then bathed in a gaudy green light. The couple put on a macabre makeup and grimaced in the mirrors. Cerebren a dealer and then choke to make sure. They mistreat a storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit one on top of the other, licking the food and then jumping on the bones of the other. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First they make Georgie unconscious with the mace (which contains nothing you can not find in that little red bottle of McIlheny Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), tie it, pour flour and milk on it, put it on a psychotic test, put him in one of those Tolstoy-type semi-executions, ask for a slap in the face, dress in extravagant costumes, then throw himself over him and his house in the upper middle class practically destroyed, and send them an ex machina delivery van. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, it's as if someone had told Georgie: "First act politely with these girls, then act panic after they're tied up." And to the girls: "First act timidly, do not want to impose on anyone, then act crazy". And that is. <br /> <br /> The photography and location work is taken from a 70s porn movie. I'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to make San Francisco ugly. The result gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgie's is a pop song with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in". Jackson and Donna is a sticky thing called "My Good Old Dad." <br /> <br /> Although I approve the moral lesson behind the story. There are some things that you just do not have to give up, although at first they look very funny. All very educational.
