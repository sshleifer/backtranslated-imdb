Although there are Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this film, it has no connections with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of the kung fu movie and still stand out as a classic. This is a very inferior copy to the original, and even as a normal kung fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie does not have much action. It's a scene of meaningless struggle after another, and the flying guillotine does not even play an important role in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking some villains who have left with a holy book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to attract the monks and use the flying guillotines with them. <br /> <br /> There are four films with Flying Guillotine as part of their title. This in my opinion is of lower quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film is different from the other three, which indicates that this film was produced by an entity different from the other three. <br /> <br /> The film has no chemical aspects other than being involuntarily funny due to Poor production. <br /> <br /> It is best to omit this and look at the two originals.
