Once, a friend told me that an independent film from an art house was presented in a movie theater when, at the close of the film, the audience was so enraged that they preceded to break the cinema seats. Of course, my imagination went crazy, trying to evoke the content of such a work. Well, now my imagination can rest. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong fan of Andrei Tarkovky and an ardent admirer of his work. I have met many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films are slow and inert. As opinions are what they are, I discovered that this is not true of the late director's wonderful works, which are full of meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Upon hearing that Aleksandr Sokurov called Tarkovsky's heir, I was thrilled to experience his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the outdoors trip through the fields (Stalker), this film is not related to anything that Tarkovsky has done. It does not seem to have the slightest meaning, even on a completely meaningless level. It is assumed that cinematography "superbly rigid" lacks compositional art. There is no balance, there is no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be running out of batteries in the icy snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder if his father could have been alive if he had decided before. <br /> <br /> Nor am I adverse to arguments that are not arguments or stories that progress. in multiple non-linear ways. But there is not even a non-history here. Surely one must enter the visualization of this film with a shaved head if it wants to leave without anything gained or anything lost, since pulling the hair would be the only possible response at a rate that could make a sculpture of Tarkosky's time seem as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a short film by Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I will not rule out that this is one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovsky's Solaris), but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heirs in this film. - It would be calling Paris Hilton the successor of Aristotle. Come on guys, do not be afraid to say it. No amount of impressive big words will make this celluloid corpse magically come back to life. I do not pretend to fully understand Russian culture and probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately recognized Tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift for the spectators. <br /> <br /> If it was not Sokurov's name, and it aired when saying, Saturday Night Live, I'm pretty sure no one would "read" all these magnificent analyzes in this wet noodle of a movie.
