This may not be the worst movie that Peter Sellers has done (I think Laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda") but it's probably the most depressing. The sellers, especially without makeup like Nayland Smith, seem to have just received chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, he barely looks better and spends most of the film (except for those strangely disturbing scenes in which he is shaken by electric currents) about to collapse under the weight of all that makeup. Supporters also look tired and exhausted, and the presence of Sid Caeser is offensive, even without his constant references to "Chinks". (A bright point: this would be one of the last times in which a great movie would portray Asians in such an insulting way ... or, for that matter, star in a non-Asian as one!). The film seems surprisingly cheap, with pictures of salads and monotonous sets, even the number of Elvis at the end is reduced. Only the impressive Helen Mirren and the tall, thin and nervous man who wet his pants add any spark of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film offers a strange premonition of the death of a great comic and an even stranger documentation of his death.
