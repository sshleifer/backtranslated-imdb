This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to even try and be realistic. The plot is weak, acting - miserable, the actors wonder around like in a first year production, trying very hard to act without any possibility from the beginning. What a failure! What a waste of time, money and effort for everyone involved, including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, here there are also murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago committed a murder with a knife, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention a whistle, as if a virtual agent made a cut in the throat. Also, this murder was supposed to be committed by a small, frail woman in a tall, strong man, and she cut his throat! Did she politely ask him to bow down to her? Much more stupidity of that same type is happening and leaving the audience wondering if this meant being a joke that turned out to be bad. The continuity is another big problem, as for example: the boyfriend anxious for hunger lies in bed, waiting for his virgin girlfriend to leave the bathroom and, after a long time, fall asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking for guidance to the landscapes! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT? Such a waste of time, even to try to write about this supposed "low" movie of assumptions.
