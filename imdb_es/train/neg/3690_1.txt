Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused his fall. It was launched with great enthusiasm, but it crashed badly and caused serious financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to pay them personally for the losses incurred. Shortly after its launch, he tried to venture into politics, but failed miserably. It's a very bad movie with horrible acting, poor quality makeup and a pathetic script. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, the first show of the first day in the theater. The audiences were so boring that most of them left the theater before the intermission. Sorry, I will not recommend this to anyone.
