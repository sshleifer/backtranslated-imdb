I could not relate to this movie. He failed to commit me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and not very involved. I could not connect and, therefore, worry about any of the characters, and I find it difficult to find much of what is positive to say about it. <br /> <br /> I have read that to understand it correctly, one needs to be familiar with some of the darkest aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that, as an atheist, I am probably not familiar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films that deal with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal for the human condition. Do not trust specialized knowledge or beliefs.
