When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see the Serbian propaganda in action once again. Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main reason for the Yugoslav rupture, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film is far from objective. It is one in the set of lies pushed by the Milosevic regime. All the others are guilty, only the Serbs were right and they were victims, although the majority of the War Criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, although the Serbs committed a genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, all nations independents recognized by UN. The breakup of Yugoslavia could not be avoided because the Serbs did not want to let go of the control that their nationalism had placed on the Yugoslav federal government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations to protect their interests. they are interested in an objective documentary about the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and a documentary based on facts is not this one. You should see "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", channel Made by Discovery and BBC.
