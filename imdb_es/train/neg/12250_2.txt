When I saw the jewel of Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in the year 2000, I developed a great interest in the niche of the school / crocodile of the genre of exploitation / monsters. I look forward to a misguided producer continuing with several sequels of these delightful bonbon camp bonbons. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of style and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we would need would be a cast of crunchy forage with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek's breast implants. <br /> <br /> While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus made reference to his own films, Blood Surf chose to distribute a lot of old-fashioned themes from the group of other films. See if you can see beyond the sequels sets of Revenge of the Nerds to find the allusions / tributes? / Jaws Scams, Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 Indiana Jones and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the fade for television in which the publisher gave up by making sense of the actions. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that Crock could not prove his tenor sotto voce with a soliloquy about environmentalism ... or a crunchy appreciation, but the quasi-captain of history has his force-force speech. Maybe, in the next few years, we'll see a pot galloping after a shootout on a golden sunset. Or, hopefully, a monkey will ditch the bathroom of an international space station for the dwarves and enjoy the exploding waltz of the blood spill of mono / midget / crocodile zero-G. <br /> <br /> All in all, the lack of a surf music bar bothered me.
