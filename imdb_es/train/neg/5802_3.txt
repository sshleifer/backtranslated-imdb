The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" has been filmed again and released to a home video in the United States through Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story refers to a priest who has to take care of a witch's body with only his faith to protect it. Widely expanded and set in the United States, although clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, the clothes and the furniture is all bad despite the signs in English), this is a strange movie that does not really work. Part of that is the strange scenario that tries very hard. It's hard to be a dunk in the United States, but clearly it is not. There are also some strange moments, intentionally oblique, since the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest a short time later. I'm not sure why they did that, even after watching the creation of the piece on the DVD. The other problem is the dubbing, which is more than horrible. It is done in such a way that everyone talks when their lips are not in the camera, or if they are, the voices do not even remotely match the lip flaps. I do not know if it's the fault of Faith Films or the producers who made the film with the hope of turning to the West (revealed in the making of the piece). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I said, it has all kinds of technical problems that only make this a curious curious ball. Despite some really good horror images, the movie never works like a horror movie. As the film to generate faith is too confusing in this recount to make someone closer to God feel. <br /> <br /> Given the option, I would give you a pass, even at a bargain price. My advice would be to find the 1960 version of the story called Viy that will bring some chills and some understanding about belief in God.
