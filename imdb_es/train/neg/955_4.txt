I do not think any player in Hollywood history will last as long as David Niven did, given most of the weak films that he had to wear by his incredible charm. He could act, he got an Oscar for that, but most of the material he made was as light as a layer of two-layer tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a good example. It's a musical and for the most part you'll remember the Vera-Ellen dance. You will remember that they are disguised as Scots, since the film takes place in Edinburgh during its festival. But if you can recover a single song from it, you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is clear. Vera-Ellen is the American protagonist in a musical that apparently is performing a test outside the city in Edinburgh. She starts in the choir and arrives late one day. She receives a lift from the driver of a millionaire king of greeting cards. Now everyone assumes that she is the main squeeze of the millionaire. The doors open as they have never been opened before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he agrees with this and with the various situations that error engenders. CÃ©sar Romero has some good moments here as the frenetic producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, although Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless fluff that David Niven did a lot of and got tired of.
