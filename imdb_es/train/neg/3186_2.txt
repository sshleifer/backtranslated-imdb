I did not think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb 'Mitchell', but it is successful. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker A LOT better job. But, if you like to see fat men sweat and really, really shoot the gun fights, you will love this movie.
