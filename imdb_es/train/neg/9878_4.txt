He has put a lot of love into "Fantastic Mr Fox" by Wes Anderson, unfortunately all love is for him. Of course, a lot of time and effort has been devoted to making this universe so peculiar and self-conscious, but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try to make it fun. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best Wes Anderson could do. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however, when the camera is farther away, everything becomes very hard for the eyes and to be perfectly honest it seems a bit messy. Actually, there was nothing special about acting either, with Wes opting to choose his friends and big names over more specialized voice actors that could probably have improved the movie. I am pretty sure that the curriculum vitae of George Clooney consists of two appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too cocky and tries to be too smart to be smart. different and typical, despite the fact that the film premieres in England, all the good animals are the typical Americans who play baseball, while the bad ones are the stereotypes of English with the most insulting English accents. I can not stress how much waste of time this movie is. I did not laugh once.
