When a film is independent and unqualified, like the Hamiltons, I expected it to come out of the norm, cut the violence of your heart. I know that good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read the reviews, visited the website and even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to watch this scary movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I hope horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous nuances. My expectations were extremely low for this movie, but the few expectations that were for the film were shot once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood from someone's finger. There were too many holes in the plot and left too much to the imagination. I'm sorry I did not see Happy Feet. I think there could be more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!
