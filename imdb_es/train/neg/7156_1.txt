['Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, he certainly does after this endurance test of a movie. How the hell I managed to keep going without pressing the fast forward button that only the Lord knows. <br /><br /> Maybe it&#39;s me! Maybe he does not have the premise of the movie ... or maybe he does not appreciate his supposed mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although the film has as much mystical ambience as a trip to McDonalds. <br /><br /> In addition, the characters were all terrible and there is more development of characters in a caricature of Tom and Jerry. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do it? Why do I see such a gut? It&#39;s enough to escape and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion! YAARGH !! An absolutely terrible movie in almost every respect. Apart from that, it&#39;s not bad.']
