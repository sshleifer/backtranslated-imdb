This movie was not totally what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie were to be called differently, nobody would notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really weird because I can not see the point. the prequel and the sequel just say that it does not make sense, or even coincide. maybe I'm naive, but I'm not a vol 1 and a vol 2 to match. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in jail in the first one and dies in the original, and in the prequel he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was fine, but they should have changed around some actors and part of the story and the name of the movie, and it would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end as the other one started. <br /> <br /> if someone has an opinion on this post, please.
