I thought that this movie had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on your wedding day for your cousin? I would be disconsolate! It's classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny at all. I thought that mostly I just found cheap laughs and I took them. I usually love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee plays another shameful show, which shows once again that decent class and morality are not relevant in today's society. I had a complete lack of taste and contempt movies like this. I understand that people will defend this film and its morality because it is 'Just a movie', but I still keep recognizing that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you're a bad person, since everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and some parts of this movie were nice, I'm just saying that in real life, people act like The characters of this film they made are embarrassing.
