Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton remake this sui generis movie is as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's true, an idiot has already done it - I rest my case. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with chimpnaut that is wrong in a simulation, which shows that it is not so smart from the beginning. Marky Mark appears in the shot without showing his characteristic underpants, then is rejected by a simple woman who prefers the touch of the chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The surface settlement shot of the space station that orbits Saturn for no apparent reason, inside the ship a-buzz with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to perform these experiments? The special effects team decrees it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimp gets lost in that basic element of 60s science fiction movies: Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the incredible security capability of the space station by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while at the same time demonstrating its abject stupidity by mounting a rescue mission in a wormhole for a dispensable chimp test, with a million-dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supply. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say 'Remake nonsense', Marky has sailed through the wormhole, crashed into a strange planet, removed his helmet without thinking about the lethality of the atmosphere and being chased through a sound stage that almost looks like a lush rain forest, if not for the kliegs that make the backlight of the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It is APES pursuing, or at least, * it * would * have been a surprise if no one had seen The Planet of the Apes THERE WAS THREE THREE YEARS. <br /> <br /> As Marky Mark could not show his pecs, lower his pants, or break his boring white paper, he had no character. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth were inserted crooked and helped enormously to establish his lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (also known as an irritant chimpanzee activist), lost without a Shakespeare script, did a good job of beating Marky and Clarke like most cardboard cutouts. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of symbolic comic relief and interspecies klutz. Although I have become bilious when listening to the word games related to this film, a review owner captured the essence of this planet of the apes "reimagining": "The Apes of Roth". While everyone else bothered to look like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, like Chimpanzee Thade, chews huge amounts of scenery and casts Kaka brilliantly. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade, his character lacked an arc of behavior: Thade is crazy when we first meet him ... and he's almost at the same crazy level at the end of the movie. Good touch. <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) featured a prominent character, Taylor of Charlton Heston, who was so disenchanted with humanity that he left the earth for space without regrets, but as the film progressed, Taylor lost To find out, he found himself caught in a battle to prove the value of humanity, as his only champion! The original film was, ultimately, a story of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything cerebral or ironic for Marky Mark's Leo? Or the Thade of Roth? No, but there are many races. <br /> <br /> The slogans cry: Retrieve the planet. But it is the planet of APES. In this film, humans and apes landed here together, humans degenerated into people in the cave, which allowed the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; The apes deserved to inherit the planet! Together with Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, it is taken for granted that humans HAVE to be the main predators, simply because they are there. "Withdraw" is as ridiculous as the monkeys that land here in 2001, complaining: "A planet where men evolved from APES?" and then causing problems with their excesses and hairy years. <br /> <br /> Heston was elected to the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a nonconformist: IT WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To choose him as the mute and obstinate animal in an alien society was to stun the expectations of an audience: how crazy must a world be where Our Man Charlton can not demand respect? Currently, Marky Mark has only shown that he has tight underpants. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly denigrated by the advice of the apes, he dominated the screen with his charisma and his stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the Mongoloid humans, it is as if that unpopular boy in school suddenly becomes a classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the board and throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to the icon of humanity, but he shows himself as a deviant chittering. In the original film, the monkeys consider Taylor as a deviant, however, he was, for the audience and also the apes, an icon of humanity. That irony again. <br /> <br /> It was likely that a man who spoke chewing the scene of an acting technique, Heston, should play the father of the chewer of scenes from this film, Thaddeus Roth. When Roth's simian father, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, this time he turned against the HUMANS: "Damn you!" Damn everyone to hell! '<br /> <br /> The movie becomes silly and silly towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass lesson, a pod descends from above with Marky's chimpanzee on it. The monkeys demonstrate their hebeo by bowing in reverence to this incognito creature, while Marky tests his own hebete murmuring: "We are going to teach these monkeys about evolution". First of all, they are not monkeys, ape! Second, it was the genetic manipulation and fabrications of imbecile plots that brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them when flying with the hidden lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Giving away the final turn would only confuse viewers to believe that the role of nekkid of Estella Warren was actually part of the plot (even so, my pants). <br /> <br /> It does not matter that he was the last hope of humanity; In the end, the police monkeys take Marky to the Plot Point prison, where they heard him for the last time, saying: 'It's an asylum! A WOODEN HOUSE! ... '
