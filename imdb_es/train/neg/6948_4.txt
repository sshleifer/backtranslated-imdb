An interesting idea (four African-American women crushed under the booty of society to avenge stealing banks) is ruined by the horribly slow direction of F. Gary Gray and an unbearable script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier), full of fun moments without intention. Instead of offering a direct commentary on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men mistreat and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to hit their unsuspecting audience with intellectual notions of tragedy operatic It's melodrama at its worst. Gray makes his actors stop at every tired line and the lazy edition of John Carter refuses to recover, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the bewildered faces of the artists. And they are baffled: although actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand than Gray's to guide them and as a result , they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Staying away.
