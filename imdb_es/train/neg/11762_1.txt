As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone was paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Even though the director was one of the writers of the original mini Shaka Zulu, this "addition" to the series is frightening! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played an important role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film, however, is nothing but foolishness, scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer who has not impressed since the mid-nineties. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, rescuing drowned slaves with his red buoy and his bleached smile? <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for blondes and busty women to appear out of nowhere and run around the screen in their tiny red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been more strange than the fantastic plot that was probably invented after 10 pints of beer at a costume party, where the costume of someone from the caverns inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next "success" of box office ".
