A young scientist is trying to continue with the work of his dead father in the regeneration of the extremities. His dominant mother convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for his own evil purposes. A young doctor uses reptilian DNA that extracts a large number of creatures and when his arm is conveniently torn off a few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and grows a new killer arm ... It is true that the special effects in "Severed Ties "They are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is horrible. The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people. Much. The acting is mediocre and the climax is ridiculous.3 out of 10.
