Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it is unappealable, although not because the jokes are not funny, some (I will not say that most), and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job of translating his mentally unbalanced statements into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, whatever) is so terrible that the film is intolerable. Some equipment called "PKO Productions" gets production credit, but it does not seem to be produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and did it all in one afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear or understand whatever is supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes a compliment for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Bedtime Stories of Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime" by SNL. Also, the "cat swimming" section of the movie is a great scene to watch if you want to scare someone. 3/10
