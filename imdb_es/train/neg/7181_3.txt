Now do not get me wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love it is a wonderful life and I really enjoy the versions of a carol with George C. scott and alistair sim. But this particular movie is horrible. I think the song I love the life that the ghost of the Christmas gift sings is especially painful. Albert Finney sings quite well in Annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it looks like someone is trying to sing with his mouth full of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this movie was to turn off the sound and see the dance numbers accompanied by the Christmas CD from South Park.
