Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Soda, meaningless and immobile. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and company. You can travel through time with the help of "The Forest Spirit" ("Princess Mononoke 'a lot?) There, they meet an idiot boy named Sam, and the" plot "begins. <br /> <br / > So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) go crazy with nature, they become hippies and they try to free Celebi (the "Spirit") from a weird type of hunter, I do not even know what else happened. It happened in a blur, Ash's friends were almost not there, and all the fighting scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends must return to their time, while watch Sam float with Celebi (that scene was creepy ... OO;) Then, after returning to his time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandfather, and I think that's all. is not it? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this (1 of 10).
