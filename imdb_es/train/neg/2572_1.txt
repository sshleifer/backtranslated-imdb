This movie delivers The best thing is when the uncomfortable teenage neighbor tries to get away from the babysitter's bicycle and, deep down, it seems that he has never been near a bicycle in his life when he tries not to fall. <br /> <br /> but this movie does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it presents a scene of nothing more than an arm that crosses a fence and arrives at a refrigerator that draws a beer. <br /> <br /> stereotyped grill dads, several plot lines that do not go anywhere, and a former SeaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone add up to make this Saturday night perfect at home.
