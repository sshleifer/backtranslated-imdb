Well, I'm impressed, a Woody Allen movie I came out of after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie that I've seen less than half of, but I hope you understand, why). Basically, it became clear from the beginning that they were going to sponsor us from the screen with: a script that exposed their idea as if it were with bullet points; a cast that all tried to be characters of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were misdirected to do so; and a camera that sat around portentously, only so that there is nothing to film, except the chat and the actor who delivers it. Drama? Any; It is partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I left it too soon in this case, but by then I had decided another hour and a half. -liner-Allen clones. The script has its fun moments? I was almost completely on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (tow hooked again, doh!)? but there is little rhythm to let them fly carelessly, as is the best. Worse than this there is no fluency. To say that this wooden film makes a forest look like a jelly: the opening discussion of coffee is the most abject case. The only thing that should be done with numbers is to check in a pot? 2/10.
