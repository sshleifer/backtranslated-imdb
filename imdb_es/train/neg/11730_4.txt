Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; This time, he's behind "The Night Strangler." Once again, police officials and fellow journalists do not believe or want to cover up the supernatural angle. Producer and director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", with understandably less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis gathers a fun cast of support, including former "Dark Shadows" alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) heads a sexy collection of belly dancers. And, although I've never seen it mentioned anywhere, that must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's dinner companion in an early scene, pretending disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Nighttime Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
