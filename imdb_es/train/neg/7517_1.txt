*** One in ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it was, I would get an F. Holy Mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave him all the reasonable comforts considering it was a video movie, but I was disappointed at all times. Like many other B movies, the basic story was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a pity that they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds some fraternity bags that host their annual Halloween fundraiser, when a book of satanic spells appears out of nowhere and throws the boys of the fraternity into a living hell . Well, that's the idea anyway, but instead, most of the film is devoted to showing the adventures of these fraternities, which abound in a scandalous lesbian sub-plot. Very little of the real story is dedicated to Halloween or the mysterious spellbook. Actually, I'm annoyed that the filmmakers thought they could get away with making such a trickle. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially about frat boy relationships. This is NOT what the movie is billed as. I am tempted to locate the producers and, at least, threaten them with bodily harm. The acting is as bad as it is, it is atrocious! The script is involuntarily fun. The cinematography is simply lazy. The whole movie is amateur night. This film actually makes SyFy channel movie productions look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film felt as if the filmmakers realized they were not producing a soap opera and had to launch some kind of horror sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone into the enchanted house in the character they disguise. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Woohoo! I mean wow! This was an indecipherable disaster.
