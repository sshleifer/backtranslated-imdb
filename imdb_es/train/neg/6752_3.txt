Unfortunately, more downloads than uploads. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror movies. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it was not, but every actress / actress was attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the disadvantages is that the movie only becomes exciting after the first 40 years. minutes more or less The rest was pretty boring. Another fall (or you might consider it an increase if you wish) is excessive nudity. The 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the boys showed their butts for a long time. It's not like I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'. <br /> <br /> Unless you're really desperate to see a guy take off his bathing suit and run naked for a while. Few minutes, or seeing a girl undress for no reason, or you're a Debbie Rochon fan, this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, get away.
