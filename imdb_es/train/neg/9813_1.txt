... and I've seen some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly, as expected. Daryl Hannah does a good job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie is that the plot is so weak, although based on a good premise, that the writer resorted to the "stupid heroine trick" to create artificial suspense. When all Daryl Hannah would have to do is hide, run ahead of his pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what goes on in a plot, I think it would be difficult for a small and bloody woman to take a pregnant woman from a hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very scarce. <br /> <br /> Save time and choose another movie.
