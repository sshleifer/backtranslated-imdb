SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas acts in his usual strong-boy / handsome boy act, and his future real life, former Kathleen Kinmont, kicks the ass of the sexy Alexa girl. OJ Simpson is a detective, who advances little by little from his brilliant public personality. Translation: Filled cable TV. There is not enough mask to qualify this as a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has some huge holes. Better / worse moment: In a discordant scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are very hot, or words to that effect. This vague reference of necrophilia is sufficiently offensive; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released, it is truly frightening and, therefore, entertaining in an unintentional and horrible way. I was so startled that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now that is a guilty pleasure. BC
