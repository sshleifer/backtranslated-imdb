<br /> <br /> I'm a big terror / science fiction fan no matter the budget, but after seeing countless horror movies late last night on cable and video, this has to be the worst of all films. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that showed up again and again) and people running screaming from left to right, then back to the right. He should have stayed in the initial scene of the convenience stores and stopped there for 15 minutes. Instead, it crawls very long. It's very, very low budget of x5. Many scenes were too long. The narrator sounded very fond, as if a person outside of high school were talking. This is the only film in my opinion lower than Hands, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. megalon despite its higher budgets. 10 doze, try to stay awake through the whole movie on stage or better yet, avoid it as you would with a mafia that does not eat brains. The Why-Did-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. The epitome of nauseatingly badly made films, etc. infinite. -infinite / 10
