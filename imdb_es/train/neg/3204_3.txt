Although it is not as bad as it has been made (I have seen MUCH worse), this is still a very unconvincing movie. Basically, a repetition of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", with the main difference that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than Joe Don Baker, an unattractive actor if there was one. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is great (and very funny) as the bad guy, a kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, since the rest of the cast offers a mostly terrible performance, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, it is hard to believe that he was once a romantic protagonist (see "Mondo Cane" to see how he escapes from women). Looking here like a second-floor Ben Gazzara, he has nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all this was adjusted to the music of "action movie" generic of the 80 that could not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good series B movies ("Without warning"), but here stumbles, falls. , he breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the places in Malta were nice, and Venantini tries to save the day. 3/10.
