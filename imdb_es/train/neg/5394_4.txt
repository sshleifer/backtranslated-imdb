I get angry at Shakespeare's modern adaptations when the director can not decide whether to use the original or update it. If you use the original words in an updated configuration, it is particularly difficult if configured in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work well in period styles, for example, the Twelfth Night by Trevor Nunn is established in the Victorian era very effectively . It could work with the configuration of the 30s if there had been much less of the song and dance and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it only ends up being a fairly trivial but very nice show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly he is a very experienced actor from Shakespeare who, despite all his efforts to be just another student, his acting force shows all the time. Of course, I should have played the King, there is no problem in having a mature and student King surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a nice but not imposing actor for the King, therefore, a so-called King without any imposition of Kingly attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of songs and dances, which I found tedious despite the nice songs and the nice enough dancing, unfortunately meant that Shakespeare's great dialogue had to be drastically reduced. So everything ends with a trivial and soft confection, and I got very bored, even with the comic turns, and I was glad when it was over. Branagh has not done justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> However, praise for Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.
