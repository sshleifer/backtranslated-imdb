I do not know what this movie is about, the director Sam Mraovich, somehow, ruined almost all the small aspects of this movie. Normally I would say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this may be the most important of all times. This film should exist for the sole purpose of being, without a doubt, "The Worst Movie Ever Made". I have seen bad films in my life, but this somehow divides what I considered bad into something much more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the most fun is that Mraovich himself considers this a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
