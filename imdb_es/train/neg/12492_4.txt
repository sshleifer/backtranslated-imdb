This is one of the films that has an incredible video box but that has camera work and unknown actors who speak with a bad dialogue. It's so dark when murders happen that you can hardly see it, and the movie is hard to understand. The only star in this is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before she retired) and she is a good actress. I like low-budget movies, especially ones that have mistakes because they're fun to watch, but Severed is not one of them. This movie is good to see if you like voodoo and cut heads, but this is not a blockbuster, but if you need something new. To see then rent Severed.
