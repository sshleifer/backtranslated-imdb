Before starting ... let me tell you that I believe fully in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, now that it's out of the way, I just want to say that what the hell are these idiots doing who call themselves "hosts" thinking they're doing? The last time I verified a host does not discriminate, I cast hatreds full of hate on television or tried to put their own beliefs on every unfortunate soul that ventures into the channel. Of all these fools, idiots, conservatives, blows from the bible, Fred Phelps' lover, Pat Robertson, does it every day. I am in favor of freedom of expression, but since when does that cover a guy who practically says that if you venture into his ideal way of life, they send you immediately to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOOO's many problems. One day, in our classroom, we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch some television because the teaching did not give us any work. And we (against the will of many of us) saw the 700 Club, and of course that idiot Pat talked about the Bible and said that Simon said "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I heard a child see "Hmm, I guess he's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a big sin, then they seriously need to take that host, stick them on a sticky tape and throw them off on a cruise in the middle of the Arctic.
