***** probably small spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say that I liked it, but I can not say no ... it's very strange. It has bad things like, for example, a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine. If I were the director, I sure would cut that part, it made me want to stop seeing the rest of the movie. ... For some people it will be boring because it lacks action, sometimes it feels like home ... Take, for example, a scene in which one of the friends died and the next thing they are doing is what? nope, do not cry ... their horror stories are told to each other ... * sighs * (just after crying for their lost loss) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat that They had like "hundreds" of candles on the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by a kind of rag curtains (old rags covering the windows) and sofas / armchairs ... I thought I was dumb, using candles but without thinking about the environment, besides being alone on the high seas ... <br /> <br /> Good thing, some scary scenes are well done, I liked some. Sometimes, horror works best when it is hidden when it is behind something instead of showing itself, so this movie does it well, maybe because I do not know, but it works well for me! You will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones I mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much of that! but if you like any kind of movie, look at this, be patient, try to enjoy .. hahaha <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Regards
