There has been a lot of talk about the use of Rohmer's digital technology to "complete" the fund. Sometimes it works well, the scene in which Grace and her servant witnessing from a distance the execution of the King is particularly surprising. At other times, it gives the movie a strangely amateurish look, similar to a home video. However, the main flaw is that the pure artificiality of the staging creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know that what we are seeing is not real, how can we feel about the characters? To be honest, I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> The other major flaw, I'm sorry to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film is based on her performance. Okay, he is speaking a foreign language, but he is unable to express real emotions. Her excitement in the scene in which she tells her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by newcomer Helena Dubiel) when she saw her head on a stick caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Also, look at your hands when you are expressing emotion! <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very disappointing movie, especially considering the positive reviews of this site.
