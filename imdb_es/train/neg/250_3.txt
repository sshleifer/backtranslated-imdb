Having seen three other versions of the same movie, I'm afraid that this is by far the weakest, mainly because Scott has a pretty boring and lead performance. Their emotions are so insipid that it makes it difficult to participate in the movie. Alistair Sim played the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his worst, you do not have the feeling that Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis it is equally unconvincing. I can not think of any actor in this movie that matches those of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) assume that they are better executed. Very disappointing.
