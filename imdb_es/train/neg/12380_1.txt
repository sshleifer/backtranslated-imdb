The creativity of this film was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left aside a good story, only to replace it with horrible special effects. This movie seemed to be focused on funny kids, but I could not even achieve that. Many small low budget movies have the potential to become great movies, but this movie is not very close to that. Fortunately this will be another film made easily, and easily forgotten. This movie was probably an opportunity for the actors to earn a little money until they had the chance to play a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a little respect for movies, should avoid watching this movie at all costs.
