Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw it last January, the movie disgusted me so much that I walked and talked to my girlfriend on my cell phone for the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut, maybe I'll see it, but this PG-13 garbage movie is crap and the worst of all. Maybe if the movie had had some T & A it would have done well. But the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. Worse than a troma movie.
