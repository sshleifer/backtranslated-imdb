I sat through this movie and I have to say that I only managed to keep my attention. The movie would have been a little more bearable if I did not have to watch the horrible CGI, for future references to the industry if you are going to use CGI, look at this so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that does not look like a graphic novel at all. <br /> <br /> In general, the story was not as bad as the CGI. I was quite impressed with the performance and thought that the casting was good and that the information of the characters would have been good, since sometimes it was a bit confusing, but that is not surprising, because as I said, it only kept my attention, but Honestly, I wish I had failed this one.
