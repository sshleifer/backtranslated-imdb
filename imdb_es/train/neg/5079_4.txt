What a great actor to have in such a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production, however, is quite good, although it is set in London but with exteriors in Bristol. No matter ?? see a cathedral, you've seen them all, more or less. <br /> <br /> However, the story ... is about a man born with the power to cause death and destruction to anyone and anything, if he so wishes. With only a passing reference to the examples of real-life telekinesis, the narrative constructs an image of a man misused and misjudged as a child, a teenager and finally as a man; so much, in fact, that he wields vengeance at will, literally. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that everyone is on the wrong path and, therefore, intends to destroy the lot. However, just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The problem with the narrative is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge them all with an almost religious trap to produce a mess. Theory above all. Mixing fact and fantasy in this way rarely works. and I'm afraid that Richard Burton had to exaggerate terribly sometimes when he tried to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal punch when they left home: a sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, delivered as only Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good cast of support, however, helps make things look and sound a lot better, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the very underestimated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as editor, Towney and some other actors of well-known characters. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented, as flashback in flashback to complete the background story and thus solve the immediate mystery. of the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer with the murderous disposition. Until then, it was a good job as a visual detective for Brunel and his English partner. Still, it was very predictable, as it quickly became very obvious to me about the identity of the would-be assassin. <br /> <br /> Then, they went and ruined everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you want to know what that is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson got the bad guys at the end. And, the last scene is just stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways in which Morlar could have stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Actually, because this could have been a much better story and movie. I guess Burton really needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you are a Burton fan, spend time to see the scene I mentioned earlier. Otherwise, do not bother.
