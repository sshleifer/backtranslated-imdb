This was a terrible movie. There was no story at all. To top it off, when they could not explain the blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw a few aliens! I hate when the directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: How could Vinny say "welcome" when he did not have a tongue? It's a pity that Mr. Jones did not have a more important role. The second thing that bothered me was: why did Vinny Jones's boils show up and he cut them and put them in blue liquid? Then, they have no other role. Why not? I do not like that they show me something and that has nothing to do with history at all. Soon. Bad history I would not waste my time, I would have liked to see Mirrors instead.
