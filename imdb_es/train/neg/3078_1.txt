I did not think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts ... really horrible. The fact that it is not taken seriously (usually something good) contradicts, mainly because the actors are so cunning that they would really swear they are reading reference cards. However, ultimately ... the MST3K version, as always, has some laughs ...
