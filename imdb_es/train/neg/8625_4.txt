In the unlikely event that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free of charge!), From the perspective of the viewer. If you want to make a serious movie of exotic adventures, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, having a ridiculous "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and following him with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head makes you look as if you did not have IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make. This is boring, meandering, cheap, racist ... you get an idea. A couple of clever moments and some flashes of nudity from Kathy Shower (too prissy here) are hardly worth it. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
