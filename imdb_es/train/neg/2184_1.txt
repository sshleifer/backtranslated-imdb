This film is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and poorly designed plot devices. <br /> <br /> Story of the film: the director of this movie was a pervert who was driving through the city filming random women. When his wife discovered the film rolls, he was forced to come up with a story quickly. He stated that he was making a movie called "The brain that would not die". Finally, his wife demanded that he show her his "called movie." That night, he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and was born "The brain that would not die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot synopsis: The main character's fianc√© dies in a horrible car accident (which caused him to ignore the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the remains and reanimates her. After resuscitating his head, he goes and picks up a group of prostitutes. That's more or less what happens for the rest of the movie. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and I assume they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side notes: The final credit screen states that the movie is called "The head that would not die". <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
