I just got back from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than "Catwoman", who had the decency to at least pretend to be fiction. <br /> <br /> In "September Tapes", a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" heads to Afghanistan, despite not being fully prepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yes, the vendetta psychotic and ridiculous of his The leading filmmaker will avenge the death of his wife on September 11, to locate Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> "They made" eight films on their trip, which now "document" their travels and, of course, their It tries to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight films, fortunately, all end in significant points in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary"). <br /> <br /> The psychotic, the idiot protagonist, who receives long and meaningful speeches that probably learned to see "MacGyver": he does not care about his own life nor about the life of his innocent team, since he puts them more and more in danger through a series of completely stupid setbacks. I do not know why he not only had a sign on the back that said "Shoot me." <br /> <br /> The crew's translator, supposedly his sensible voice of reason, does little more than complain and be dismayed when the idiotic hero leads them to perdition. <br /> <br /> You wish they had brought someone on their trip to call them all imbeciles. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4", I began to encourage terrorists to film the film crew.
