... but this just does not work and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. For what reasons? There are some loose clues here and there, but all the material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet they are very funny when they do that. There is some visual sense, there are subplots, characters, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, meaningless. Because what needs to be explored is either "small", too exaggerated or simply said before in a superior way. It's just that Lynch explores DV, nothing more so it should be treated like that. 1/10
