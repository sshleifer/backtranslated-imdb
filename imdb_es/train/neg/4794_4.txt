Why watch this? There is only one reason and it is because of the greatness of John Saxon. I love his performance. My favorite appearances of him are Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as Nancy's father as a cop, Black Christmas as a cop and From Dusk Till Dawn as a cop again. When I rummaged in the mall of my local video store, I came across the movie Zombie Death House and quickly threw it back, but before continuing I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this movie, but the first time I did it. Heard of a director. This intrigued me (also the cheap price of $ 9.00) and me and I had to have it. Upon returning home, I realized that this film was not up to Saxon's other work, not even his performance, which may have been confused by additional management pressures. But it was not just him the other actors who sucked as well. It seemed as if everyone had been taken out of a recent porn photo shoot and now they told the guys that they really have to act. The film even looks like 80's porn quality. I can not recommend this movie in good faith to casual viewers, but if you're a 1980s obsessed fanatic, you missed the culture that emerged from that era at birth until late, or a fan of the best movies, this is for. Also if you dig John Saxon like I do.
