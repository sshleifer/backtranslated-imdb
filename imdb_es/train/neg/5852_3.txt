Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; With a partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which a character pretends to define as an elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book with the hope of reconstructing his life. An aberrant mix based very loosely on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It is likely that NBC has refused to broadcast it outdoors, and this is how this low budget came to the cinemas. Director James Goldstone goes crazy with hyperkinetic visual effects and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes crazy with zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, their colorful tricks can not cover the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the acting is excessively mature. Dillman, under the pressure of remembering the events of the night in question, attends a Seminar of tics, stutterers, wipes for the nose and crazy crazy laughs of an actor, while spitting out dialogues like "Dream ... a dream ... drugs. " ... yes, drugs ... that SOUND ... bells ... help! Like an evil scientist with a Cheshire cat smile, Pat Hingle almost outshines Dillman in the Grand Thespian department by continuously addressing everyone in baby talk, strutting like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth in agony. We hope that Lange's scientific and loving interest receives a small response, but not before she yells at Dillman, an indifferent lover: "What do I have to do? Speak, cute man. This is a frantic "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 of ****
