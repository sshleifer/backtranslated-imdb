This movie seems to have many people who say it is one of the most brutal of all time. After having seen it, I can say that it is not up to those claims. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is really insane. But in general, the execution was not at all worthy of anything. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) is not really that disgusting. I expected something crazy, instead, it was of lower quality than the gore presented in films like Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> of ultra low budget. Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed, as it is not a story at all (although most people surely know this). Gore fans will be disappointed because, contrary to popular belief, blood and guts are few and far between. Not to mention that the actress who plays the victim could be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it just sucks. Avoid it
