I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched parts and considered it too silly to check again. The excessive amount of watery "blood" at the beginning is simply obsolete, not to mention the sounds of wind "lashes". My friends and I made a very low budget movie, and the effects still surpassed this crap fest. <br /> <br /> As for the amount of errors in this movie, there are too many to count them. I knew one of the actors, believe it or not, he was my TEATRO teacher. SAY AH! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not bother with this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of a possible 73)
