No matter how you look at this movie, it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> If you see it as a horror, then it is a movie that does not let monsters see as hand puppets. <br /> <br /> If you see it as a comedy, then you will notice that most of the humor fades and is unconvincing. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you'll wonder why a man would stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you see it as an action that you really can not do for the complaining hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie can not offer anything. remotely entertaining. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious puppets and this movie was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. The bugs looked pretty good, and also the Ghoulies, even the puppets of the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this movie are totally unpleasant. The hero is a plaintive security guard, his girlfriend always complains, they have a vagabond friend who has an idiot military boyfriend, and another friend who is a Spaz. At one point in the movie, the hero and the military guy fight with rakes ... this movie is completely stupid. I like the scene when they're in the dreaded club cinder (which obviously is not a club, but it's more likely to be a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 years and I look younger than any of them.
