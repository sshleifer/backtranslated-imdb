I love these actors, but they were wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can only ask myself, what were you thinking they agreed with this shit? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger called him on the phone. in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was profound. Well, if you liked "Breaking the waves," you'll probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10
