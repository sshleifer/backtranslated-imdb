The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio" there is nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome lives everyday life that is boring and false, and everyone asks others what they think of them. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story will end. This is because it is simple to see the moralistic vision of Muccino in this film, so even the most difficult parts seem normal. To summarize in the first 2 minutes of the film would be sufficient and the objective of the film was already stated. The family saw from an age of 30 years, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality, but to be consistent with their thoughts has to push situations more than normal. Really good how Muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the caregivers and is the only reason that makes me not sleep in the cinema, although always in the movie I scream from the beginning. Maybe it could be good to see the family how they really are and not blame something for it. Morante was intense and great as always, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
