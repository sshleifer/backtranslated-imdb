Kill Me Later "has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) about to jump from the top of an office building protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill her later ". <Br / > <br /> The real execution of this premise, however, is destabilized, since almost all actions serve as a mere device to move the plot towards its predictable conclusion.The characters written with poor quality that show no reason why their behavior compromises the quality of the performance.The lack of depth of the character diminishes especially the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn hesitates to be moody and acts as "cool" and, ultimately, presents himself as a confused dolt. it is unfortunate, since in other circumstances, Blair is an attractive and capable actress. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the insistence of director Dana Lustig on the use of quick cuts, special effects It's incongruous (for example, look for an infrared motorcycle chase with no hilarious intent at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hope of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd. Certainly, Ms. Lustig shows that she is able to master the technical aspect of the direction, but in no way does her ability help overcome the problems inherent in the film and, therefore, the film continues until the end. Clearly, Lustig has a different visual style; however, it may be more suitable for music videos than for movies. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be praised for their ability to make this film: they could scare up to $ 1.5 million to finance the film, get a good cast and get national and foreign distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent film. However, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
