I bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. It was buying 2 get 2 for free and I needed one more, so I chose this one. Horrible mistake The box reads like it's a really good movie. Well, it starts like this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that's it. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who dies trying to save her boyfriend, Jack, from a bull. The father of Laila, the Cordovan, is a rancher that the people of the town fear. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because he was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes hunting to find him. It was the first 5 minutes that is fine. What follows after that will only be 100 times worse. Who wrote the script, in my opinion, had to have been on an acid trip or something, because nothing else made any sense. Jack is running away and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who takes him. I think Maria is supposed to be a virgin Mary character. You know, the mother of Jesus. But, who knows, I could not do anything about it. While they run ... we can see the bad guys, the magical visions, the ghostly encounters, the flashbacks, etc. And all these things are done in such a way that it hurts your brain to try to discover what is happening. Needless to say, I recovered the movie and changed it for something else. It's horrible I'm telling you, horrible. And, there is absolutely no fighting of bulls in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I have helped other people to avoid wasting their time in this movie.
