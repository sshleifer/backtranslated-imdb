The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck gives a certain credibility to his character of the frustrated artist. Imbuye their dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to appear as a real person and not as much as a typical villain in the B movie. <br /> <br /> The story line is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. The talkative and philosophical character of Kosleck is contrasted with Hatton's low-profile monosyllabic approach. The character of the Creeper has not developed much beyond a basic level of monsters, but Hatton suggests underdeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his background story. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot in Shock Theater when I was a Child, so I have a certain nostalgic affection for it. It is worth seeing once, anyway, for those who enjoy the horror films of the forties.
