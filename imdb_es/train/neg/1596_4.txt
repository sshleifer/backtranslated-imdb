It is not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon enter the story. You can see how strong Celebi can be, although he first becomes evil. <br /> <br /> Suicune also appears, it did not seem so powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder did not do it. Do not you have many strong pokemon, except for that taranitar? Some fight scenes with your pokemon may have improved it. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet Professor Oak, much younger, although they do not realize it. Misty was thinking that she had it at the end but she did not come close. I saw this in the credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
