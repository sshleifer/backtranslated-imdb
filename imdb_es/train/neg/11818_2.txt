On a distant planet, a space monk saves a psychopath from execution. He releases some fellow prisoners and leaves the prison in a spaceship. They dock in an absurdly huge ship that is orbiting a supernova star. This massive art is populated by only three people, probably because the budget of the film did not extend to the hiring of many actors. Anyway, to shorten a long story, the three goodies end in a game of cat and mouse with the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The psycho of this movie is curious because it is annoying. "Annoying" is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic: deranged, frightening, perhaps dangerous, but not "annoying", but it is. The three people who run the giant ship are not so convincing as to justify such important roles: this ship is practically the size of a city! Taking into account that the film will have an approximate duration of 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that there can be such a large ship made by man, regardless of the fact that it is used for such a mundane task. Despite the vast size of the spacecraft, all the crew members have been equipped in a frightening manner, the rooms are small and the dining room is formed by what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are many runners. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty well represented and works like an average science fiction thriller. But nothing great.
