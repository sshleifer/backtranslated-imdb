This is a fascinatingly horrible movie. It makes so little sense that it begins to create a kind of strange internal logic for itself. Well, he would do it if he did not keep going down side alleys until he eventually wobbled under the weight of his own indecision. The film can not decide if it is a direct film of 'Man becomes a monster' (as in all those years 50 'THE INCREDIBLE insert verb verb ING MAN' movies), or a big business conspiracy theory movie scary, or a mystical contact story after death, or ... or what? Choose your option It's just a disaster. Grotesquely at the top and shooting in all directions, leaving the loose ends fluttering all over the place. It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch's pills. Unfortunately he did not take enough.
