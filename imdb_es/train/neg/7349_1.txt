Polyester was the first John Water movie I saw, and I must say it was also the "worst" movie I had seen so far. <br /> <br /> Water's "talents" group included several people who I'm sure worked for food, and was willing to say the lines that Waters wrote. Everything about the film is terrible, the acting, the camera, the editing and the story of a woman played by a 300 lb. travesti, Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That said, I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny, and you will not believe the shit that happens to poor Francine. Her son blows solvents and steps on the feet of unsuspecting women in the grocery store. Your daughter is the fucking bitch in the city. Her husband is a fan of pornography who does everything possible to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress in history. Edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines of a reference card and has never seen the script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the tribulations of Francine, Waters prepares a fabulous Hollywood finale and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
