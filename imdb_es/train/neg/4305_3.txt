A while ago I saw this movie on a video CD. <br /> <br /> First I will mention the positive points. <br /> <br /> The film, at first, at least tries to look like it's unbiased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and coexist very well in a country and an economy that is not booming, but at the same time it is not failing. Their families get together and have parties and practice their favorite sport, shooting with sports rifle, as companions, not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But, after the first 15 minutes, the plot is at a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that, for some unknown reason, these friends should hate each other. That for some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Of course, the script adds television images that the characters seem to be watching live news programs in English, but the videos are from 1993 and not from 1992, when the war began. <br /> <br /> The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the second largest party in the Bosnia Parliament (SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP had to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a coup d'Ã©tat in January. The Islamic Democratic Action Party of Bosnia took full control and held a segregated referendum in March in which Bosnia was declared law and announced secession. <br /> <br /> The story of IDAP begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from "STTH". He was a student of Nazism in the Second World War. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf" in which he said: "In fact, it is not possible for there to be peace or coexistence between 'the Islamic religion' and the non-Islamic social and political institutions." <br /> <In 1990, he lost the IDAP elections to Fikret Abdic, a "moderate pro-Yugoslavia", a Bosnian Muslim, who worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War and who treated his supporters as brothers. Izdicbegovic prevented Abdic from taking power. He lost the elections but seized the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The above events are missing from the movie, but they are the real events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with the accessories. The Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet helmets from World War II, which they did not use. Also the only soldier who held a M-1944 WW2 rifle only used by the USSR, not Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The Director and Script Writers had an opportunity, but chose to rewrite the story.
