Badly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogues. Not a single scene shines. The actors fight against a painfully boring scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprise, twist plot or conflict. You know for the first ten minutes he's going to. <br /> <br /> For a movie in New York, you almost do not feel anything for the city. There are a dozen other independent films that make it look magical on a small budget. This looks like it was filmed in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you throw Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in baggy sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and monotonous? Where is the attraction? I felt that I was watching a Christian movie sub-par of the week, it was very asexual and moralizing. <br /> <br /> The great success of Steven Feder was that he convinced people to make this film insipid.
