A mummy tells cartoons about men, women and sex between them. Eh At the beginning, the mummy randomly asks the viewer: "Imagine you have sex with this girl, imagine you have sex with this guy" about 37 times, while showing images of naked young nudes. Later, the guys mods mod girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or fast-forward) through the mummy's wandering, shorts are not bad in their own right. I found some of them quite funny. My personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed. This is a, well, strange movie.
