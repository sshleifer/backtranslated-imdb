The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. as kings of the B's. Because the people of Crown International were so important, they have not been elevated to the status they deserve. A movie like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria, but it was a considerable success when it was released (not to mention the later re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's successful strategy of taking advantage of the mood of moviegoers at the time of a movie release. Here was sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and the brief "Custom Van" fashion. As others have pointed out, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a Selectman from the city where I was at that time, I even declare that these trucks are "houses of sin on wheels!" A perfect ad line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular and low-browed hijinks (including a little support from Danny DeVito). In many ways, this is not very different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60s, but now it is complemented with the use of drugs and nudes. Obviously, with a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film progresses quite pleasantly with a windy charm that compensates some, no doubt, by today's standards, the views of women without PCs. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is A Toaster for Bobby's sin lair on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you have to have something fashionable for those sandwiches! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
