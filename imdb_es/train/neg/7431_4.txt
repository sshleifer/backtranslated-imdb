CARRY ON MATRON was launched in 1972 and it is clear that the series has reached a natural ending with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING from mid to late 60. <br /> <br /> In itself, MATRON it's not bad at all, it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot (a group of spivs trying to enter a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags of A slightly funny but unsophisticated nature. I think that's where the problem lies: the gags are not so fun with the unsophisticated nature that begins to show their age. Did we need another movie that used a man disguised as a woman to conduct the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny phrase. That is a serious problem for a comedy.
