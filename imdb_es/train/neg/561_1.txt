Well, I saw this movie yesterday and, unfortunately, it's worse than you might think. First of all, the plot is idiotic, it does not make any sense. The script is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the suspense is very low. The actors play on a regular basis, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some very bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want to make a beep * to you" and it seems, let's put it mildly, a very mature woman who acts rude and not at all sexy. That erotic tension of BI1 has completely disappeared. From the technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie, better than the typical one on DVD, but on a lever much lower than the original film. For example, the scene of the madness of joy is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who are not rivals for Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film seems cheap and poorly edited at times. I'm sorry, but the first thing I thought after leaving the theater was: "Why did not you make this movie before and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" For everyone, the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthrough in popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. He had the best performance of Sharon Stone in his career. He had this specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is a fun, unintentional, misdirected, and sure winner of the Razzie Award in many categories. It's a shame they made this movie.
