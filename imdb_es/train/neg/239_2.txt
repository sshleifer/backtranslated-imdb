I will not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I expected something good, but I think that Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At each stage of this film, I expected some spin and what do I get? The girl burns and wins the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Despite being committed, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All he did was crazed cradle. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have children, but we do not see them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it is vice versa. And somehow I knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I lost my time. I give it a 2/10.
