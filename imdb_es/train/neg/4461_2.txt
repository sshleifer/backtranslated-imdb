After a rather long and partially pixilated nudist shower scene, we head to the races for this "Blair Witch Project": request a horror movie about three girlfriends venturing into a desolate cabin deep in the forest to escape their hectic lives for a little girl 'weekend off and smoke pot. They meet two guys who seem to be quite friendly, so they drink and tell ghost stories, until at the end of the movie some of them are eliminated. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly slow movie, with unnecessary suspense. In the scenes, the bad performance can not take the myriad of scenes in which nothing but senseless jokes happen, and the film as a whole is a fiasco, a deadly dull frenzy. Nothing happened until the last half hour and when I did, I had to go to sleep to really worry. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T & A; Evy Lutzky briefly topless; and Jennifer Hart shows her right title <br /> <br /> My rating: D
