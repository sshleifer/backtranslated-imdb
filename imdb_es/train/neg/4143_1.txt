Since I and my other half are big fans of the horror of garbage, we could not resist to make a film that contained the two big ones that we were happy! However, for a 2004 movie with a cover of Freddy Vs Jason, this is a shame! The worst movie I've seen, but it's worth taking a look to laugh if you can see it. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible because of the effects ... well, in fact, I could do better on my camcorder. It is so bad that they only bothered to put on the faces of the zombies and put aside the neck, hands, etc. No history, weird flashbacks that do not make sense and terrible script! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" from a vampire "you broke my cigarette" was the response of the human who looked like Dukes' uncle Jessie crossed with Santa.
