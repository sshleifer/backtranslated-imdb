Frank Sinatra plays an ex-soldier and frustrated writer, no-goodnik, hard-living and drinker, who returns to his hometown of the Midwest and meets with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the big shot of the city with a disinterested wife and stubborn daughter Frank gets involved with the player Dean Martin, with the legend Shirley MacLaine, and has some problems with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. The oversimplified drama approaches the telenovela, with a role for MacLaine that, in turn, is too "colorful" and shamefully sentimental (his touch of drunkenness in "After You Have Gone" is, however, the highlight of the movie, and it's handled by experts). Director Vincente Minnelli supervises him directly, but he has a surprisingly sad spirit and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The image looks incredibly beautiful on widescreen, with a good eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are trapped in the feces. ** since ****
