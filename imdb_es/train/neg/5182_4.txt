Like most festival tickets, Hamiltons makes an interesting movie that contains all the ideas and little execution. Although impressive for its obvious low budget, the film wobbles in its final turn and becomes terribly long during its strange and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of marginalized murderers who try to survive after their parents died. They kidnap people, drain their blood and feed something locked in their basement. Mckellhar and Firgens have some good performances of black humor, and the rest is regular. The movie never feels realistic or very disturbing. But for the first half, he plays a strangely humorous and dark mix that is a surprising achievement. The next half is not so successful, as it recoils into oblivion of the film with unrealistic twists in a ridiculously arrogant ending that turns the whole movie into total shit. It is a pity, although there is no doubt that part of the talent was involved in this production and, although it has many flaws, it is still original and creative. Too bad that, when it comes to delivery, it completely fails at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
