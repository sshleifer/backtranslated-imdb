This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it only lasts an hour and a half, it feels somewhere close to 4. I had never seen a movie move so slowly and without a purpose. This is also a "horror" movie that takes place much of the time during the day. My friend and I laughed at a number of crazy moments when we should probably be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was launched in so many countries. It can not be so high in demand. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty should continue modeling because, although she is beautiful, she lost her accent so many times in this film, half the time she is British and half the time she is American.
