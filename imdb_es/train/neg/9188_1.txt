This is the only movie I've seen made by Uwe Boll. He knew that he is probably the worst director who always makes movies based on video games, and that "House of the Dead" is one of the last 100 of IMDb. But I still wanted to see it because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what the movie has that makes it so bad. After watching it, I agree that it's crap, the movie had no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but brainless topless teen girls (for a moment I was wondering if the zombies are brain dead or the girls?) Then, at night, the zombies jumped out of nowhere and I started to Attacking people later, a woman started shooting them. I mean it takes you to one place and then to the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy, or horror? Or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the final credits, so I could not see everything, which is good! The movie is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not make any more movies. Thank you!
