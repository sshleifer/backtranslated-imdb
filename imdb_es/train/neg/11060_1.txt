It could have been a morbidly fascinating view of the life of one of the most famous serial killers in the United States, but unfortunately it does not even come close. Terrible edition, address, bad performance, whatever. This movie is, literally, about 10 minutes of plot stretched out in 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father, but that's not enough to save this stinker. 1 out of 10
