This is, without a doubt, the worst movie ever created. There is no discussion here. That is all. End of story. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, it seems that it was created by a three-year-old boy fascinated with dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply silly. It is inconceivable how someone could come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely boring. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If you are curious to know how bad this movie is, do not make me describe it. Words can not express how terrible this movie is. This is not just bad as in being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. Is. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply your level of evil by 5,000, and you still have not come close to how horrible this movie is. After giving Pok√©mon the movie a point, awarding a point to this movie seems to be no less than charity. That is how bad it is. Did the producers and directors take cinema classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It seems that some amateur with a high content of paint thinner made this film. If you have rented this, return it and request a refund. And do not even think about renting it again.
