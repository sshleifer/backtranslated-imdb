Phew - I do not have to say. This is a movie that could be really good with a lot of drugged spectators. Some of the performances reminded me of John Waters' first offers. Maybe I should take it back. I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / narrator. <br /> <br /> In particular, I loved the lawyer who talks about the "full faith and credibility" clause. By the way, it is "full faith and credit"! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. That kind of It is probably best to leave it up to multi-involved companies as experienced film professionals who would have the technical ability (even a trick, some might say) to achieve something like that.
