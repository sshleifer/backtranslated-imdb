I feel like they have had me, the scam is on, do not fall into the trap. After reading enthusiastic reviews (the Director was a film critic with Sky for years, so there must be many comrades in the press ready to do him a favor by writing favorable reviews). I expected a solid performance, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing development of the plot and poetic moments. Unfortunately, 'Sixteen years of Alcohol' does not live up to the promises of critics, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of low-budget special effects (what was that cliché cobweb scene there?), Fight choreography Unrealistic and insensitive and mental narrative, clichéd editions and camera angles. <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen years of Alcohol' starts in an interesting way with some pictures of beautiful places in Scotland, but it's very simple from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time building an atmosphere, creating characters that may interest us, or creating suspense, the director chooses to drive you crazy with a self-indulgent, two-handed self-indulgent. The main characters are so unfriendly and so badly acted: the audience does not care what happens to them, the desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, the 'tributes' (typical of a director who tries to pay his fees to previous teachers) are cliché or are not convincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me up and kept me in the movies, but even that did not support the dramatic narrative that connects a period of time to action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the movie became increasingly defective AND to be quite honest annoying. I still saw the whole damn thing! <br /> <br /> I guess I liked the rough realism attempt in the movie, but even that was destroyed when they were often interspersed with strange and abstract scenes, sometimes meaningless. You do not need a big budget to make a really moving movie, it's been said a lot about how little they had to make this movie, half a million is not a little money ... SO DO NOT EXCUSE! Sometimes I wonder what the actors thought ... or their agents were thinking! <br /> <br /> Skip this turkey unless you are masochistic or senseless anyway ... NOT MY THING <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
