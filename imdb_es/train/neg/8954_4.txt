I had high hopes for this movie, because I really enjoyed the book. However, I do not think I would have understood the premise of the film if I had not read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break the bonds of overwhelming government domination, but the book portrays suffering much more thoroughly. Corrupt government officials have comfortable and almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggle to obtain the basic necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way towards their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether or not they are really oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It's been several years since I read the book, but you hear references to Big Brother, The Thought Police and Newspeak frequently in the media and in informal conversations. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where they come from. I recommend you read the book.
