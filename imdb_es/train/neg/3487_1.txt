There is a great moment in * Surviving Christmas * that almost makes it worthwhile: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel on the stupid head of Ben Affleck. <br /> <br /> This film serves as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini demonstrating what a great actor is and, at the same time, blemish his acting career in this film. <br /> <br /> The young and wealthy advertising executive, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has been instilled in the belief that one should never be alone at Christmas. (And there, from the beginning, is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie: how many people in Drew's social position, in 2004, really care one way or another if Christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fifty-dollar prostitute?) Storyline finds Drew buying a family to spend Christmas, on the condition that they pretend to be theirs, insensibly ignoring all indications that their money He has not bought the emotions he was looking for. . <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a rude truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be Drew's ad hoc family, against the protests of her son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very soft Christina Applegate). Drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly recapturing his youth or ... something. The messages in this film are as twisted and illogical as their dry-mouth plot. Burdened with overt psychosis, Drew draws a fake smile on his face and blinds him negatively against every denigration he was supposedly buying from the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> What the question raises: if Drew is paying for these For people to recapture a bit of joyful family emotion, how psychotic should it be to feign happiness between its prongs and mental anguish for its presence? It is not a case of the Valco family that conceals their true feelings and pretends to be happy while they are with Drew: three of the four members make it clear that they despise him. Is he so unconscious that he can not see that his money is not buying him the "family" atmosphere in which he was inculcated to believe that it was a truth in the first place? As with all films of this opprobrium, one wonders how * four * writers could become entangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a sequence of credits that will overlook any appearance of plausibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, head of * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo *, stops right there. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine, demonstrating their mettle in this mess. Christina Applegate is lair and beautiful, blonde and hot in all the right places, cutting Drew scathingly in small strips of corpses for most of the film, then making a change of attitude and falling in love with him because the script tells him. br /> <br /> And I would not dare to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider should look over his shoulder. There is a new level of talent that desperately seeks in the city.
