A while ago I went to visit one of my relatives, and we went to a theater, so we thought we would go in and try this movie. That mistake! This movie is horrible in all departments. I've never heard of the movie before, and literally everyone has not done it yet. No wonder, this is the whole range that is put. It's a comedy, so it says, well, the only fun is the ability, or lack of it, of the director to make a movie like that. Approaching Christmas so much, this should be titled on how to cook a turkey in less than an hour and a half, or how long it was, when I left. At the end of the movie, it will come out as if he had been poisoned with food in a sick turkey, and he will regret having wasted his time in this dribble. Who knows why those things are done? Some people had left the theater before the movie ended, and I blame myself for not coming out much earlier. It really bothers me that I pay a good amount of money to see something decent, and everything that goes out and sees is a bad TV movie that must be shown at 2 in the morning, in fact, it is so bad. I should not be showing it. What else can you say? Probably there are not enough bad words that can do it justice.
