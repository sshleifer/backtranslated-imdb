My girlfriend and I were surprised at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes, we would have left it aside, but we were too curious to see if the movie could be redeemed. It was not so. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the compliments that are given to this movie. The writing was downright horrible and delivered by some of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me especially about this movie was that people often spoke there. It was an unnatural pause between lines. I understand that using a pause to create a feeling of discomfort (as in Happiness). This was not that kind of pause, it was just a bad direction. This movie could actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the foreign market is the best for this movie, because then the innate dialogue and the bad performance would not be noticed as much. <br /> <br /> In general I like this kind of small and peculiar movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this one failed in so many levels that I consider it one of the worst movies in which I have participated in recent years.
