Much worse than the original. Actually, it was * painful * to sit down, and my six-year-old son was hardly interested. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pok√©mon is marginally interesting, but the story is extra thin, the dialogue is still bad, and the music is mediocre. Watching the television program in its place is much better.
