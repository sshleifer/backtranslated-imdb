For me, this only goes like a soap opera. I suppose any description of ruthless people can be considered "social commentary." But in the final analysis, I just do not care how it characterizes this movie. None of the characters is very nice or attractive. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in discomfort. And despite the final turnaround provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) investment on the part of Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to maintain my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology, this story is sordid, melodramatic and trite. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is the least attractive role of Lauren Bacall and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspired performances, but his character is vile, and his is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving and out of touch father of two adult malefactor children, is the most sympathetic character. Most interesting of all, however, is Robert Wilke's stern appearance in a small role as a bar owner. It is better to remember him as an unpleasant trustworthy man in countless westerners, but here he is an honest and pleasant man. <br /> <br /> I take my social commentary with an interesting and engaging story and some nice characters, thanks.
