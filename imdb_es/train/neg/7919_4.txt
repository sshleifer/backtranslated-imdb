I found myself very caught in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic! But that's where it ends. I think I'm very good at finding out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely disconcert me, but I felt that they were lying to me, that all the time they were leading you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in one direction completely different at the end, they did not hit him at all, that's not misleading, that's very bad when writing and planning, someone did not think at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie It would have been much better if they had adhered to the plot in which they were guiding you, they also seemed not to answer anything, why did Jane (Maria) set fire to the teacher's house? <br /> <br /> It's a great pity. As I felt it started as a relatively good movie.
