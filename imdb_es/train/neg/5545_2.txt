"Revolt of the Zombies" proves that having the same director to renew and recycle an idea does not necessarily cause lightning to strike twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, responsible for the horror classic "White Zombie", did this. A piece of trash a few years later to capitalize on its popularity and even the recycled close-ups of Lugosi's eyes from that previous movie. There was a battle in court with the owners of the rights to the movie "White Zombie," who did not want the Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this movie, because, as everyone knows, bad movies can make a lot more money simply by having the word "Zombie" in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years ago only makes this uninteresting movie more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror movie after this debacle. The zombies here seem not to be true living dead, but simply victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create an army of zombies controlled by the mind? Get ready to break some eggs, including yours. <br /> <br /> THE PARADE LAME: the man falls in love with an intriguing woman who plays with his heart and commits himself to make his friend, whom she loves jealous. This sends the man to a spiral of madness in which he tries to use mind control techniques of zombies to change things in his favor in an attempt to win over a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I've seen. You should be blind or stupid to not see the end come. The acting is not even good. This movie makes the "King of zombies" (which appeared on the same double-coded DVD that I bought) seem racially insipid, it seems like a masterpiece of atmospheric terror in comparison and reminds us that not all black and white films are a classic. Makes the sci-fi alien zombie cheeses festival "Invisible Invaders" look like serious drama. This is a great ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic that it could probably make many fans of Korean movies (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The list of credits of the company ironically named Favorite films. I'm not sure what your favorite movie would be, but obviously you are an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance or classic movies.
