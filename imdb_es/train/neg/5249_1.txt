I'm 13 years old and I hated this movie, it's the worst movie on earth. I totally lost my time watching it and I was disappointed because on the cover and in the back of the film it looks pretty good, but I was wrong, it's wrong. But when I saw the delta, she was totally different and a bad actress and I really did not know how many years the 2 girls were trying to be, I was so confused. The film was confusing in some places and I did not enjoy it at all, but I saw it all to see if it would improve, but it was not like that, it was boring, boring and I did not say anything. And I do not think many other people liked it as much as I did. Boring bored boring
