This is one of those "so bad that are good" movies that you always hear but never see. Unlike the films of Troma that are deliberately bad and countryside (and I do not have fun), this is 100% pure serious. <br /> <br /> However, with features like a supposedly lethal killer robot that speaks as one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid journey and a magical first mate who invokes lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East , the fact that you take it seriously pushes it so far from the edge of the evil that it completes everything around entertaining. <br /> <br /> Enough observable for that.
