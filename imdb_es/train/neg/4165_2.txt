I am a big fan of the camp, but when each 'turn' of the plot is predictable and bad, although obviously I do not intend to be, I even lose interest. I was going to qualify this as 3, but the end dropped easily. His only salvation is that he hated other movies more. There is not enough beer in the world for this.
