I could not give this movie a bad rating or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some minor and disturbing elements that are based on the psychological, something that the film could have focused on a bit. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a nocturnal storytelling deejay who is experiencing personal problems: his lover moves out and Gabriel has what appears to be a case of narrator blockage. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14 year old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. She lives with her adoptive mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland does not even exist. I will not go into details because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I will tell you this: it is quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere to tell a story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, who I thought was the key character of the film. Collette is, without a doubt, one of the most talented and charming actresses. Her ability to connect with the psyche and the personality of the characters she plays is very strange and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think I could get an award for Best Supporting Actress for this if the script is a bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but predictable. If you are curious about the ending and the turns of the movie, watch the movie, otherwise you would rent another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
