When I saw the preview, I thought: this is going to be a great movie. And in fact it could have been. The actress who plays the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the film is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the entire image. The level of language was too familiar and contemporary for an action that took place in 1610, and took away most of the magic of the film. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the subtitles in English were more refined and appropriate than the original French keys, and probably explains the good rating the film received in the imbd!
