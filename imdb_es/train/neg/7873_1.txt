This movie is so bad and it gets worse in every way imaginable. It is not only the bad performance and the script, nor the scanty and perverse time that one loses when they see it. What really puts this movie in my room of shame is the apparent struggle writers and producers make with the movie to try to make it fun. The actress who replaces the descendant of Jean Reno is too old and learned her lesson in the first film, so they add a new girl who is getting married. Almost all the original extras and gags come back, however, this time it makes me want to mature my eyes, because it is a waste of a perfectly good movie. The torture of the constant cuts and shots of the camera in any scene of this film can put the viewer in violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original, extracts it from its coffin and parades the corpse in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the fir tree, could not fly because it did not have a plot in the directors who came back for a "necklace". No script, since apparently it was written and added daily. There is no attention to the camera or shots in mind. Bad lighting and special effects made by the simple fact of doing it. This movie would not even go through a student movie in the Basic Movie 101. How could anyone tell how this stack was overcome. It was a great investment to lose and it seems that no one had the strength to eliminate this cruel and unnatural error of our miseries. This movie has a good part ... its END! This movie is my worst movie of all time, finally "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
