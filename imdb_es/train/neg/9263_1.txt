What was the deal with the clothes? Everyone was dressed like something out of the late 70's of the early 80's. The cars were even old-fashioned. The school was outdated. The attire of the nuns was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with its neighborhoods and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole movie implied that it was held in 1991. My mother was laughing and saying, "Wow, WHEN DID this movie become?" When we pressed the "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to be typographic! Did anyone else notice this? However, my FAVORITE part was when the woman told her exalted husband, over the phone, about the cross invested in the mirror, and he simply said, "Well, look, I have a meeting in Congress. late ". That line was simply classical. ONLY AS A MAN! My mother's favorite part was when they gave "Spawn of the Devil Child" their own Rottweiler. My mother said: "Just what the devil's spawn needs ... a Rottweiler" She also enjoyed all the people who collapsed in the churches, grabbing their breasts. His OTHER favorite part was the guy in the school parking lot, driving 5 miles per hour, driving directly to the garbage truck / garbage truck / front loader. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he kept walking, with a really silly and empty look on his face. I mean, how fast can you go in a school parking lot? Whatever is!
