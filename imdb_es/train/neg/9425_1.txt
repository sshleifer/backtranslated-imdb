Did someone edit this movie? Or was it just the release of the DVD that had huge thirty-second spaces between scenes? Although it's okay, I fell asleep looking at it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is not really the worst I've seen, but it's close. The performance is not the worst I've seen ... but it's close. The production ... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I had seen in my life. I do not try to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used more production. <br /> <br /> Please, do not think I'm a fan of horror movies, or even that I did not enjoy this movie. I felt that I was laughing at the movie a lot more than I felt that I was laughing with her. The gruesome moments were not bad, but could have been done better even with a reduced budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed uncomfortably developed or ignored all together, the end of the turn was pretty bad, and the exhibition lasted an eternity Without exposing much. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
