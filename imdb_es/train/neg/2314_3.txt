Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced by a double droid, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips traces her and discovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate the world leaders. <Br /> <br /> I did not expect much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget science fiction / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker." That movie was nothing special, not to mention a flagrant theft of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop." This sequel is the same as before, with a total action sequence that opens the movie. There are a lot of explosions, heavy shots and a lot of bodies, as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the movie star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes linked with a minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
