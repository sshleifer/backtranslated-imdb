Honestly, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. For the first 30 minutes I was stunned in my seat, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But since I had not paid to see it in the first place (passes), I thought I could stay. And I did not think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> He did it. I will review the low points quickly (includes some spoilers): the horrible presentation of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two doctorates. The characterization was inconsistent; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete asshole. Then there is the description of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; We see a lot of sensational news that is accompanied by ridiculous computer prompts of the translated Bible Code. In addition, terrible sequences of "action": Lane escapes difficult situations without explanation, and the only time that Lane really seems to be in danger, it turns out to be a sequence of dreams! That's nice for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a movie. The pace was bad: after a long opening, the first third of the movie changes scene every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there are still too many unnecessary jumps. And as someone else mentioned, the years go by without anyone (not even Lane's little daughter) getting old. That was disconcerting. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good things. The quality of the film (for example, the lack of grain) is high and very attractive. The outdoor shots were well done and the shots in the place added a touch of realism. Also, there are some moments in the last part of the movie when Lane calls God (finally) to help him, this proved to be quite stimulating, even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked this because I thought it was the only genuine scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by a greater incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the performance were ALL badly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot had been more tense and more focused, and the characterization more complete, the film would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the Omega Code disappoints. You definitely do not have to pay to see this. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
