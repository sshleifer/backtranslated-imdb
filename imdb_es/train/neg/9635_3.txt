WOOHOO! Pretty terrible things. The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and links up with artistic director Joseph Losey for this Tennessee Williams fiasco that is notoriously ill-conceived. Taylor plays a rich and dying widow who holds her fortress on her henchmen on an island where she dictates, out loud, her memories to an incredibly patient secretary. When the scoundrel Burton appears claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes that his time is over. Extreme playfulness: it is difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly or if Williams intended to make his characters so unattractive. If that is the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton mutters his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor yells at her. She is really horrible. This is Noel Coward as the catty confidant of Taylor, the "Witch of Capri". <br /> <br /> Presumably, BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves --- two Williams standard themes, but it's so misdirected by Losey, that Taylor and Burton did not explain it to the audience during his mostly uneducated monologues, any substance that had the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has an impressive photograph, the camera should have been out of focus to ruin the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast includes Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as the clever doctor of Taylor and Michael Dunn as his nasty dwarf security guard ... both he and his dogs make a large number at Burton!
