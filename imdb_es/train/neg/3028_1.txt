My rental partner rented this movie the other night, so we saw it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the whole film is recorded with this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cold angles, radical movements of the camera: for the moment, you feel like you're about to see another "Snatch", for the moment ... <br /> <br /> When the plot really starts to unfold, one begins Feeling as if an amphetamine had been overdosed. Things just do not make sense anymore I'd hate to spoil the fun of watching her by giving certain scenes, but, again, the movie is so bad that it really is better not to watch it. <br /> <br /> First, you think it's a crime. Story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. INCORRECT. This conversation does not provide a coherent narrative at all. By contrast, Domino's lesbians appear in the character of Lucy Liu during the second part of the film, which makes the audience more confused. <br /> <br /> Then I thought maybe it's a movie about a high-class girl. but dysfunctional backgrounds that grew to become a difficult bounty hunter. In any case, that is the message conveyed by the initial scenes. But after that, the issue of Domino's character is completely lost in the criminal plot. So, in summary, NO, this is NOT a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably the story of a robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 million disappeared, the bounty hunters pursue suspected thieves, the children of the Mafia are executed, their hands are removed, Domino tries to decipher why this time they do not obtain reward certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dissipated by another U-turn of the plots. <br /> <br /> This time we are faced with the sad story of an obese African-American woman, who falsifies the driver's licenses in the local MVD and who at the age of 28 turns out to be a younger grandmother. Lateesha stars in the Jerry Springer program, tries to spread a new and extravagant racial theory and, at the same time, struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Urgh, well, nobody knows. Except that the director had to explain to the audience where the bounty hunters will put the fare of their collectors of 300,000. <br /> <br /> Then, at some point, you start to think: "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things." There is a reality TV crew driving with the bounty hunters and doing some violent takes. The bounty hunters are also trapped with a group of Hollywood actors, who only complain all the time about breaking their nose and dragging too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a film about the media, they only appear sporadically throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other subplots: the Afghan hooligan who is determined to liberate Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Can all the things mentioned above be included in a 2-hour movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear: it is a real disaster!
