Fortunately, there is not a video of this wannabe to the west that a vehicle to stay afloat for Big Frank at a time when his career was failing. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his older brother and that the bad guys escape from the city only to reunite the people of the city with a new courage, must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all, this show sucks. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must completely separate myself from the other critic who found him "... underestimated ..." Critics criticized him at the time and deservedly. You will have to catch him in the last program, if you get up late and have an insomnia attack. But, if you can sit through it, you have more strength than most of my movie-loving friends.
