This movie is not only boring, it is also very badly made. The graphics are so bad, they're not even second-rate, they're terrible. The characters show no facial expression, the voice acting is empty and soulless, and the plot absolutely lacks ... well ... everything and everything. My 5-year-old son likes it, but he thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
