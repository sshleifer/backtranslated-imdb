I enjoyed the movie a lot, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain violence, sex, drugs or special effects, and it does not need them a bit, and it catches my attention all the time with images, stories and words of wisdom interspersed. <br /> <br /> However: [1] some of the accents in foreign languages ​​made the dialogue difficult to listen to and understand; [2] there is an unnecessary excessive use of swearing (especially the word F, which is the only reason why this movie was classified as R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution of the last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to the loss, Living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie due to the 5 seconds of background narration, which did not add a little to the secondary character to which it was applied, nor to the film; I just turned off the movie and got stuck in my It reviews the whole movie and then: the mother of German descent of the main character, when he watches old films of the Second World War, "secretly seeks the Germans." There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazis won the war. I do not know any Germans today, except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
