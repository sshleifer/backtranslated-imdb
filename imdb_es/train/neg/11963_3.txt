I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie, since I know that he admired Alan King and that they would be fun together. I thought I had seen all Billy's movies but I could not remember this, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false emotion; you can smell every scene that comes (and goes!). Billy does not even become funny very often. He is too busy trying to cry false tears or show his anguish at how badly his father disappointed him. Alan King himself is quite nice, as is the secondary argument about being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence is that Billy simply visits his father just when a serious health crisis occurs, etc., or that two busy doctors can simply close their practices to go to the Moon in Los Angeles. And when the end comes, boy, is it coming fast? Almost as if the writers had realized that they had been painted in a corner and the only way out was to make a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with some flashes of good humor.
