First of all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I guess most people who look at the information in this film just wanted a blood test, and that's all it is. <br /> <br /> Parcel? There really is not any. Basically it is Saw but in China and much worse. To emit? There are none, period. Special effects? Absolutely awful in my opinion ... There were cuts and the blood was often completely unbelievable due to the amounts, splashes, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I think the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal, shock movie. Now I had great potential in a larger budget, but the scripts were poor, the dialogue was poor, the performance horrible, what looked like video footage of a camcorder and the incredible "gore" made this movie really horrible. <br /> <br /> it's worth risking against some criticism, even the "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (the traces of blood, for example, were the most recent that were worth it), but this was simply horrible. I hope that people who are considering this film read my comment and decide not to do so. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of brutality and commotion, but general unrealism and truly horrible acting make it a horrible experience. Save your time / money and try something else, you will not be disappointed.
