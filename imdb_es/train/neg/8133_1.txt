The movie is as fun as watching the sun. Servant Pataki is a total retard who loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat ass making smoke from his puffed cigars and drinking alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking all that is called "Blood" , which actually looked like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots seemed very horrible even to call this piece of shit a movie. The rest of the characters In this movie there are total losses of time, the end was horrible, the contours were corny and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell the spectators? My advice would be to get your rabies vaccine if you have already seen the movie. This film can give you foam in your mouth if you did not get the updated shots.
