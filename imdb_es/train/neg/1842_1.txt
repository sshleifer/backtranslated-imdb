This is my first film criticism in IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not, in good conscience, allow this movie to not be reviewed by me. You must warn people! <br /> <br /> First, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and boring, situations are devised, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are not friendly or interesting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poop. <br /> <br /> It does not matter to spend money on this movie, it's not even worth the TIME you spent watching it. Please do not see it ... I beg you!
