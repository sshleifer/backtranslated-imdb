This movie is a massive yawn that shows that Americans do not have the farce. Even when it has already been written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is an ingenious comedy of errors that would qualify as 8/10. It is not just a linguistic translation, but they completely skip certain absurd chains of events, which rob the film of its original and absurd nature and turn it into a cheap farce style "Go, go my pants".
