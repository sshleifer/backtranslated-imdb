Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, focuses on three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Very good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples are divided into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual men and a heterosexual man who is being "harmlessly" harassed by a gay man. <br /> <br /> The "het" couple does not really have much paper in the movie. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when they have sex or play with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose, as they are very marginalized. I suppose they represent a more everyday illustration of how sex / violence are integrated into the life of a couple. The couple is not very aggressive and is not even filmed erotically. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or the plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends make up most of the plot. They get involved in some kind of attack on homosexuals by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This intensifies in violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And his need for freedom from violence grows as the movie progresses. The main problem I had was that the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in real danger. It just does not work Since the whole subject of the film is about the relationships of the characters with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help either. Sometimes, it's okay, sometimes it's very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had the rouge stained on his face. Confused. <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is the "couple of the stalker". Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent story. Maybe it's because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end. Shiner could have been much better if he had continued with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this movie. It's admirable. Most low-budget films do not aspire to much. I do not think Calson has achieved what he was looking for. Myself, I did not find anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was not convincing. However, this does not mean that the director can not achieve something with his next film. <br /> <br /> It seems he has something to say.
