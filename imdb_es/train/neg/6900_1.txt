I sat in the theater as bored as hell, I wanted to go in the middle of the movie. The argument is simple: 4 Samoan types ruin weddings. So they have to bring an appointment to enter the wedding. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What most angered me were the so-called crude jokes ... They were very funny, clich√© and thrown in your face, to make you enter the already boring movie. The performance was below average and I felt that this movie went on and on about nothing more than a lot of jokes without grace and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006, without grace, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God, a friend shouted at me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
