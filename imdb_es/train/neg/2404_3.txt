Man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie suffers from a horrible rhythm. Jump through in a confusing and confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story does not even make sense. Why do you want to break the soccer streak? What about the stupid violin music? None of that is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a group of accountants who try to make an improvisation and say "Look at me! Look at me, I'm being funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's movies, but the man failed here. I could not wait for the credits to come out. Horribly disappointed.
