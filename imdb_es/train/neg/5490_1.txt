When I was a kid, we would always take care of children, and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies we saw. This is one of the stupidest movies I've seen, I think it could even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie. A Martian falls on earth, becomes human, befriends a human and is doing everything possible to return home. But it is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of the actors, back to the future, Christopher Lloyd as the Martian, Uncle Martin, the fool and the fool Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah like Lizzie. But other than that, it's complete shit. Poor!
