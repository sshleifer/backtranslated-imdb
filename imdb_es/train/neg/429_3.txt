I was attracted to see this movie for its star power, but ultimately that's all it offers. It is played much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in big cities. Its biggest flaw is its predictability and its absolute lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and we just keep going as they fall like dominoes. The film to his credit abstains from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or emotion in any other way. All the flavor of a good and flat decaffeinated diet cola. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
