I was going to say that this was the worst gay-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie if I've ever seen a genre. <br /> <br /> You know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a "personal note" from the Director, requesting the "understanding" of the audience for the "many challenges" a Director faces for the first time. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. The bad lighting, the bad scenes, the bad photography, the bad script, usually the bad performance, add up to make this "movie" can not be seen. I managed to reach the bad end after several attempts and immediately gave away the DVD that I bought foolishly. I am sure there are many challenges that a Director faces for the first time. But, do not try to remove this unconvincing attempt as a finished product. I see from the details of IMDb that this was not only Richard Natale's first management attempt, but also the only one. That's the only positive thing I can say about this supposed "movie".
