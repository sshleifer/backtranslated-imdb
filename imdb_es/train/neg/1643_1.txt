"Whipped" is one of the most horrible movies of all time. It is a piece of petty and hateful garbage that forced me to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000, apart from maybe "El Grinch". It is not, as people have called it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. That would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While the film was honest and comprehensive, "Whipped" is a hostile, cynical and misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this as many pests, unless you want to see how bad a "comedy" can be.
