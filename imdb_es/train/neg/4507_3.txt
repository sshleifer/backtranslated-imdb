Despite a generally pleasant plot and expensive production, one wonders how a director can make so many awkward cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese costumes and the cultural advisers? Apparently not on the payroll. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine really laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities that she saw unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation, he said: "Imagine a Finnish director making a Finnish film about the American Civil War with blond Swedish actors like the Union Army and French like the Confederates. Worse, imagine dressing the Scarlet O star 'Hara with a vintage hoop skirt losing the hoop and wearing a hairdo from the 1950s. Maybe some people in Finland do not realize that the hoop skirt is "missing the hoop" or recognize the strange hair Jane Mansfield, but in Atlanta they would not believe in their eyes or ears ... and laugh in the corridors ... damn story and excellent photography. <br /> <br /> So ... observe Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone who is familiar with the Japanese cultural nuances, the real geisha or the Japanese dress, and that was the theme of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic vision of film making. It's things with a lot of money while they let the details that really polish the refinement of a movie be shamefully wrong. I thought "The Last Samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad a good movie about Japan could be. Memories of a geisha is shamefully better and worse at the same time.
