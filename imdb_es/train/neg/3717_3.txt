Chris Rock, seemingly desperate for a cozy stellar vehicle that transcends his appeal to black and dominant audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Wait" with an urban agenda. He plays a comedian who is involved in a car accident that takes his soul too soon from his body; therefore, your angels must find another body to place it, and you can only find that of a white businessman. Rewriting a film as bland and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was at the box office (this was strictly a corporate movement organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not fight for something more luxurious or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with a Night at the Apollo? The excellent cast of support (including the generally reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and the fantastic Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems clumsy and unsure of himself at all times. * 1/2 of ****
