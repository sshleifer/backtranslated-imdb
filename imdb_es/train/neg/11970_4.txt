... so that the lieutenant has chosen this one. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. In the worst case, I need this to happen or we do not have any film: if Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but he was convinced that his "people" would leave the missionary, he would have put her in that first helicopter and left with those refugees to the border without her. He would not have committed his package for the refugees. This is not how it works. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have drama. That's why we make films, because reality is not so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had a viable chemistry. That said, there are also some well-done battle scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Check it on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
