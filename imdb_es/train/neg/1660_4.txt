EXTREMITIES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Monkey <br /> <br /> A woman puts the tables on a possible rapist when riding an assault in his house, and he is forced to decide if he kills him or informs the police, in which case he could be released and attacked again. <br /> <br /> The fanatics of the exploitation could be waiting for another fight 'n' Fantasy of rape list in the style of WOMEN'S DAY (1978) almost certainly will be disappointed by EXTREMITIES. It is true that the character of Farrah Fawcett is subjected to two uncomfortably long rounds before gaining the advantage over his attacker (a properly slobbering James Russo), but screenwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only until the moment before unveiling the dilemma. It informs the moral core of this production. Would your final solution be held in a court of law? Maybe ... <br /> <br /> Based on a play that supposedly left its actors abused and bruised after each performance, the film does not try to open the narrative and, instead, is based on an environment confined for the main action. Technical and acting credits are fine, although Fawcett's excessively moderate performance will not work effectively for viewers who might trust him to provide a way out of his indignant outrage.
