This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me see it. There are so many mistakes and nonsense that it is impossible to even bother to know the characters and the plot. How about this, for example ... <br /> <br /> The "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's shirt that appears miraculously during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> The priest's palatial office ... complete with a folding table desk <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look beyond technical flaws, you'll find a horrible cast and cast. I was very surprised by the fact that a front-line gay actor played the religious fanatic on the right. His initial scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, caressing his kitten, was very funny. <br /> <br /> I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / provider / dentist / composer (and whatever else he did in this movement) to actually get a movie like this one distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game, but do not rent it out for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
