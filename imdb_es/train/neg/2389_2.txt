Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and monstrously big thumbs) hitchhiking across the country, and finally finds her true place among a group of cowgirls illuminated with peyotes on a ranch dedicated to preserving the Whooping Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, with her thumb or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted the book by Tom Robbins, but his satire does not have a main objective and only slides all over the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it does not involve an audience). The notorious failure of the box office was not as well ignored, and one can see why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, the direction touches and the cinematography are variable. Thurman is a stitch posing along the road trying to get them to take her, but this almost puts the roll to Phoenix's career. The writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but perhaps should) has the safest performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
