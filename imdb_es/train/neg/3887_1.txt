I managed to see this with the help of MST3K, and oh boy, even with the riffing of this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be overcome by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (how little there was) came from the special effects, which were "fine". The performance for the most part was also "OK"; although it is nothing special, it was of a superior quality to other B-Movies that I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is very bad, the camera work often seems to just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it's almost funny. It never really explains why the hell survived in the first place, or it needs human flesh to survive. The script is badly written and the dialogue rubs against a stupid plane. The climax of the movie (if there is one) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
