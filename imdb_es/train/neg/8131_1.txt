Unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the transformation of the wife (the devils! They ruined it for us). In any case, if this film was not made for television, it should have been like that, it is from a budget that is so noticeably low, it is underestimated, it is underestimated and it affects all the clich√©s of the 70s except the disco. Nobody is nice, and you could neglect what happens to anyone in this. Eminently forgeable except for bad, bad performances.
