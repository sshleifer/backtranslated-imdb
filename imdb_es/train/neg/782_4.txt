Apart from the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious imbecile, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez has ever been so fun. I've seen your stand-up and I've never uttered any resemblance to a laugh. <br /> <br /> His things appear as vengeful and his animosity towards white people springs from every pore of his body. <Br /> <br /> I have laughed at the jokes of white people of many comedians and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> I Feel bad for the Hispanics who only have this show to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The graphics of the shows are always very simple with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Laughter canned before the comments and the dumbest scenes. <br /> <br /> That may be why this show is always on at 2AM on repeat.
