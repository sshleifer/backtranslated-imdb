Maybe television is so brutal someday. Maybe the "Big Brother" was just the first step in the direction in which Stephen? Richard Bachmann` King described the final point. But enough of that. If I dedicate too many words to talk about the serious underlying theme of this film, I do exactly what the producers expected when choosing this material. It's the same with "The 6th Day". No matter how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion about its subject, which serves the producers as advertising. Let's not be fooled by that. The social criticism that suggests the summary of the plot is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a violent film, more speculative, more for the sale of videos than for the cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without having read it, but when I saw the film, I thought that they could not make such a terrible movie with a good book: in a typical 1980 set with 80s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger he finds himself as a policeman who flees from the killers in a cruel television program. The public is cheering. <br /> <br /> Along with the "Predator," this is definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie, 2 stars out of 10.
