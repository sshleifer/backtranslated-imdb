Unfortunately it was a mistake. This movie reeked from beginning to end. It was hard to see because I used to see Clarissa Explain everything every day on Nickelodeon. I love her. Then, the next thing I found was that it spread in Maxim and that it was beautiful! I really have not heard anything about her until I saw this movie in an accident. He could not believe that he would even let something like this see his name everywhere. Everything was wrong, but it still seemed that someone somewhere on the team was really trying to save a sunken ship. Pity ... I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie.
