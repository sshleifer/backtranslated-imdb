I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. The boy gets the kind of things in the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - However, I liked the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds. And the British were bad? (aside from Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to that? Oh, and they kept saying things like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'", but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that? I would like to see this version in 20 years with more British actors. I preferred the original series. Sorry!
