I saw this movie and sometimes I got angry thinking that the movie "saw me". Munchie blemishes the "farce" for years to come. See Star Wars again, do not look at Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I am talking to those who are now parents), I (you) would not allow my (your) child to always participate in this festival of pseudo-occult videos. Insinuating Munchie is satanic, for a co-viewer, a cold 'duh' is likely to be unlawful. It is diabolical, alien, rolling and completely malevolent, like the man made flesh of Bogey, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the possible income thanks to the years of self-denial and prudence). He is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals. He is everything that the morally conscious spectator is not. He is Ron Popeil himself of the devil. <br /> <br /> I pray (this is literally and figuratively, with emphasis on the first) that this film has not made the format jump to the DVD. I hope this kind of "yellow film" died of death on the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that. It goes a lot
