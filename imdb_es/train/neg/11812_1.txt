... however I am not one of them. Caro Diario, at least, could be seen for two thirds of the time, but the third boring and self-centered section of that film gave us an idea of ​​what was going to happen in this extraordinarily self-indulgent disorder. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but he does not want to do it, while the viewer feels that he should continue with it, but he does not want to do it either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing to carry out with the Party leaders in the interior, but it is characteristic of this film that we can never see anything from them. Interposed to the political ravings of Moretti are the events that led to the birth of his son, and the subsequent takes of home movies of him with the baby and then with the infant Pietro (the film drags us through several years and more of a period of choice). We are still waiting to see some definitive sequence or convincing argument, but they never arrive. For a doubt, I might have the patience to see a Nanni Moretti movie again. It manages to make an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
