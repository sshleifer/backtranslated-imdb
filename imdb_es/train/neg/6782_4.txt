It was not one of Keaton's best efforts, maybe it was a veiled attempt to take revenge on the family he married: the Talmadges. A barrier of the Polish / English language and a series of coincidences lead Buster to a marriage with a great Irish woman, who (along with her father and her brothers) treat him badly, until they believe that he can be an heir to a fortune. The wrong identities abound here: the gags are configured and, in general, do not work. <br /> <br /> This Metro short has at least two real laughs: Buster's skilful change over his lack of dinner with the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally take the meat to his plate. The other is a family photo, with the whole group slowly collapsing on the floor while the camera tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> The overflow of the yeast beer could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built with gags, but it stops short (for all accumulation) of development. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is crisp and clear and the score is for player piano, drums and sound effects. It's not one of Buster's best efforts, but it's worth laughing.
