Boring, foreseeable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical (Weller) who travels the country only to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he kills everyone on his way with only a touch of his hands. On his dangerous path, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film does not have an original premise but even though it could be much better. The final result is just a movie without suspense or difficult moments. Even the good cast is completely useless. I give this one 4 (four).
