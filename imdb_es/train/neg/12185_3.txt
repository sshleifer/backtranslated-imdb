What did Martin Scorcese possess to remake this film? And not only did he remake it, he ruined it completely? The absurd decision to convert the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated and much-talked-about performance) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of the attitudes that Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) harbored - attitudes that compel writers Think that the best way to drive a character crazy is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br />
