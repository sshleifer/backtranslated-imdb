There are people out there who will give the green light to anything! That's the only explanation I can offer about why the movie House of the Dead exists. And that's just a terrifying part of the whole movie. It is so bad that you will leave the movies forever. Seriously, I wanted to turn this off and pass the TV to the paint drying channel, but my word forced me to suffer everything. I do not know why I do these bad things to myself. <br /> <br /> As if it mattered, here is the fundamental part of the "story". A group of 20-year-olds is so desperate to go to an island in the Pacific Northwest (actually, in Canada, because it's cheap) for the "Rave of the Century" (consisting of about 8 people and music without equal) to pay a steep old fisherman $ 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That has to be something rave to make it worth it! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (wait, I thought it was the HOUSE of the Dead?) And that all are condemned yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> First failures here. Why would a small rave (of the century my foot!) Be held on a remote island? Why would someone voluntarily pay a lot of money to get it? Why pay even more for the steep old fisherman to take them back when they could return with the others? <br /> <br /> Once they arrive, they discover that the rave (consisting of approximately 2 tents, a small stage). and a port-a-John has been shattered, there is blood everywhere and there is no one around. What would any rational thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless people, obviously blind decide to go and look for them. Soon they discover a dilapidated old house that is 50 times bigger inside than outside. Another half hour of stumbling in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill some of the minor characters, and after much tedium they return to the house. The characters, like the movie, do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Stuck in this horrible disaster is an overabundance of incomprehensible dialogues, atrocious performances, mumbo-jumbo exhibitions and millions of clips from the popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers that I will never know. The clips do not refer to any of the scenes and only degrade this garbage even more, if possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the game, except for a cheap and disposable line in the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the movie Double Dragon seems worthy of several Oscars compared to this garbage. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have taken his money and run, but he does the best he can with the horrible script and brings a bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast sucks, I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and they deserve to die. <br /> <br /> Also, if you cut the nonsense and insult and nudity, I do not see any reason why this movie can not be seen on Saturday morning television. It is not terrifying in the least. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the bad skeletons in this movie. And where do all those bad guys come from? There were only a few people on the island to start with. I guess this justifies the reason why they chose to reuse the material over and over again. I'm not kidding, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is the final culprit of that scandalous loss of celluloid? Nothing less than the director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie does not exist. Clearly, the actors they see have no idea what they should do and that the zombies do not really take everything seriously. It seems that the actors are reading the reference cards as they constantly stop in the middle of long sentences and continue talking as soon as they see the next card. Everything feels very unnatural. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was filmed as a two-part miniseries. In fact, I've seen better television productions. And do not make me start with the edition. The film is an incoherent babbling with thousands and thousands of meaningless takes and dozens of meaningless camera trays. He did not put any real skill or talent in doing this at all. It really baffles and disturbs the mind how movies can be made so indefatigably bad and George A. Romero can not even make anyone answer their calls. House of the Dead makes a stupid reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'postmodern', but it only irritates them to think that ESTA is in the same category as a REAL zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Why it's worth it, the anamorphic 1.85: 1 image looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very impressive and only serves to pronounce even more heavily used ADR. The DVD comes with extras but why do you torture yourself. Is not this warning enough? Keep away! You are all condemned, I tell you! Condemned! Condemned!!!
