Odd slasher movie by the producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's biggest success, the band said they would never make "really killer movies" because they felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made movies better: people who kill each other Yes they are real and less fun. A good philosophy and a real shame that Band, after destroying the Full Moon studio through such desperate commercial deals, became so desperate for the profits of the home theater that he started doing exactly what Blockbuster wanted and sacrificed creativity. and originality. The team behind this also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Rite of Birth' - both equally soft by the standards of the Full Moon. Debbie Rochon is at her usual best here as a rookie in a band of dudes and doubts who decide to invent a story about a "club of murders". She, obviously, does everything possible to join and then panics because it is not a real story and Mrs. Rochon believed her and now everyone will have to run to cover themselves with blood and maybe kill each other or maybe do not. The choice is that there is and, with respect to this movie, it is yours ... it is not recommended, but it is not all bad either.
