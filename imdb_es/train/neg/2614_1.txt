A sequel to (actually a remake of) the 1996 Disney remake of live action from 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from jail after a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov "healed" her from her obsession with fur. But the "cure" is broken when Cruella listens to the Big Ben figure, and once again goes on a crazy quest to become the perfect coat of the Dalmatian skins. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it is a "Thanksgiving family game" movie, designed to absorb every last penny available from the marketing machine from Disney. Glenn Close over-on-about-over-acts like Cruella. With all that he had to put up with in this movie (the lame script, the endless makeup, which is baked on a cake at the end), I hope you have been given an extremely large paycheck. <br /> <br /> (Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candle-lit restaurant, all located inside the same building, as in the climax of this movie?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin's" of this movie, pulling out all the stupid "Home Alone" gags on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running on their hands with luggage carts, spraying them with icing, etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit that dogs were pretty good actors, much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely lost in this movie as a crazed French furrier. The two human "dog lovers", repeated from the previous movie, but with different actors, are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner in an Italian restaurant, the film takes place between the two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the scene of the dinner "Lady and the Tramp". I thought to myself, "Oh, please, do not go there!" I half expected the humans to do a satire in the dinner scene "The Lady and the Tramp", as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux", making the "kiss of the spaghetti rope", pushing the ball of meat with nose, etc. <br /> <br /> And do not make me start with the annoying parrot with the voice of Eric Idle. <br /> <br /> The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the film * are good. But they are the only good thing about the movie. The rest is unbearable dreck.
