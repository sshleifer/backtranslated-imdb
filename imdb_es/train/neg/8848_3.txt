Somewhere, buried deep inside this movie is a half decent movie that tries to get out. The only tracks are some of the first scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and cemetery) and, later, a couple of pieces of production design. As I say, buried very deep. One of the biggest challenges facing movies involving the supernatural is how to make characters react credibly in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (probably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was it?) A werewolf, as I recall, in the line of; "Oh seriously?". It is not one of the best answers to that challenge. The non-sequential ones continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba, the "queen of the werewolves" (apparently self-appointed). Like Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, the Reb Brown performance and the oddly ape-like werewolf outfits. The final credits have assumed a status of minor legend and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on YouTube. Look at them to see why and remember, the whole movie has more or less the same meaning. If by chance you got it on US television. The credits have been reissued to replace Danning's repeatedly interminable shot by tearing the top off with another repeatedly interminable shot of his ripping one layer, only this time he has some kind of top at the bottom. . It is a kind of absurd moment of cherry on the top that defies satire.
