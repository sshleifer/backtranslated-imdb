Derek's products during the 1980s produced some decent offers to acquire the title of "the worst movie of all time", and this is probably his main achievement in these bets. In fact, this film can be considered as belonging to the category "so bad, it's good", up there with the products of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this movie with some people who deliver outstanding notes. <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn made the strange dubious film in his time, but this performance as a ghost of Randy is incredibly bad. To be seen to be believed.
