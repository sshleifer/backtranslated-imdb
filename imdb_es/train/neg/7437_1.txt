This movie is simply not worth the time or the money spent. Filled with clich√©s and a plot that does not make any sense! I can not believe that so many people have given this horrible movie a 10. I think they're fans of the movie maker. <br /> <br /> If I could give a zero to this movie, I would. Too bad that IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that, to begin with, I never had high expectations of this film and, however, I felt little changed. Take my word, do not waste your $ 8 on this piece of garbage. The only entertainment that came out of the movie was making fun of the name of the directors. In total, highly NOT RECOMMENDED!
