I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I could go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the film a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has some novel elements, although in reality it never reaches the level of being interesting. This film has all the characteristics of being a brand for the drive-in theater market: ultra low budget, amateur acting and a liberal dose of sex (for a film from the early 60's). In fact, I wonder if maybe the only reason the movie was made was to make quick money AND because someone knew some strippers that they could use as extras. The film is about a crazy doctor who wants to transplant the cut head of his girlfriend to the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are skanky strippers or a model, whose only real purpose in the film is to flicker when most of their clothes are removed. However, they continue too much to make the film worth watching for the bad things and the film is not horrible enough to deserve the attention of fans of the bad movie.
