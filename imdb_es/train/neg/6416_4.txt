SOME NON-COMFORTABLE SPOILERS NEXT <br /> <br /> Why do people, when disoriented or sick or frightened in a club, cross the middle of the crowded dance floor on the way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind would hide under the bed when someone bursts into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger's door and when you do not answer IMMEDIATELY, open the door, come in, shout a few hello and then start checking your things? <br /> <br /> If you were being chased by someone you just discovered was a murderer, what would you do? Does it escape silently and hide under a wooden platform or between metal implements? Running, in a low voice, of course, to an old disheveled barn or other decrepit structure? <br /> <br /> I could be talking about almost any suspense movie that has come out in recent years, but since this is the "The Return" page, I'm obviously talking about "The Return". I saw it for free because I work in a movie theater and I intend to show all the "frightening" films. I thought that this was tolerable ... apart from the worn out clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really monotonous and seems a little "Huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly released as the film progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting, except that there was not enough explanation as it went on, so I almost lost up to the last two-thirds of it. <Br /> <br /> If you're a thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there's nothing better in the theater and you really want to see a movie, uh, I guess it's worth a matinee ticket. If you thought that the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
