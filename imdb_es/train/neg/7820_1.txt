or: is it a bird? It is a plane ? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: there is no need to look up in the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic movie like the Titanic to break the box office record, he failed. . The SR structure can not do this, the dark and restricted color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), the usual boring dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, the lost fun and magic, etc. They make the movie completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a character like Superman is that he is a superhero. That is the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> The problems of love and a sadly lost depressive Supersoftie can only be a facet in a Superman movie of 2:40 in length, not all the time. <br /> <br /> Because then he is no longer a superhero or a superhero movie. It's like a social study (and in this case, very bad and boring), where every 30 minutes a person flies. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervilians, Super and most importantly, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to do a drama of long soul love problems of 2:40 about lost people and sadly? Then take normal human characters and make a new version of Yentl. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then, Supersadlysoftie is at the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer tried to kill the legend without the kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do this. Do not give up, plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> The next time the singer (and Warner Brothers) make a superhero movie, not a superlative depressive soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all kinds of subjects, yes, there are many talks, some jokes, action scenes, etc., but the only one that all these worst pieces have in common is their poor quality. br /> <br /> It's just a super boring mosaic and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous strategy of the cast (LÃ¡nzalos as young as possible, so Can make sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, she looks like 19. Superman was five years away, so she slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 (she looks 13) and a daily reporter planet, writing "I spend a night with superman". Warner Brothers, that's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not that bad, he's playing some wood, but the whole movie is made of wood, so ...?! The temporary good was marsden and sometimes posey. The rest, forget it. Even Spacey, this is not your land. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder acted very easy, with fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> The postures of Jesus at the end are also ridiculous. What the hell should that be? The problem here is that they mean this seriously, not as a joke. The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or the angels? Or speak directly with God. Why not ? They are superheroes, saving human lives every day. So at least one talk with God each week should be possible ... Oh, my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this was not the real movie announced, but it comes from a strange boring parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the Warner brothers, this depressive super movie will possibly be the biggest disaster in history. Not just for the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult (perhaps) it was to create and transport some messages or feelings, but to show people alone, lost and sadly is not new and thousands of movies or TV shows made it better, in old or new ones like Magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this super flying woman, I'm sorry, superman, of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, that's just nothing. In fact, it's more than anything, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for movies (comics / superheroes) and steals three hours of our life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother. (Very angry and green as the hulk.)
