I have stopped trying to find out what version of this I am seeing. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And although this is not the important part of my objection to this movie, I will say that when watching a film made obviously in the Age of Aquarius (including the long-haired hippie girls and the odious wagons of the station) but with a The soundtrack of the synthesizer of the 80 is disturbing. Extremely disconcerting <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW TO ATENATE THE FILMMAKERS TO THE LIVE FRANCALINA PAMELA LINDA LIKE BUTTON. HOW YOU ARE DARE <br /> <br /> Seriously, she's adorable, and that's it, but in the two movies I've seen her, this crapfest and the excellent Legend of Hell House, kill her. <Br /> <br /> I would like to advise the film industry. Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from business, but if she ever decides to make another movie and some damn schoolgirl tries to kill her, I WILL ASK YOU TO LISTEN. <br /> <br /> NOBODY IS READY PAMELA FRANKLIN AND IS WITH HIM. I AM VERY CROSS. THE FURY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED. <br /> <br /> For fans of B movies looking for a crapfest, you could do much worse. On the positive side, this is not a film that involves Satanism peripherally and circumspectly; This movie is a satanic hardcore movie. <br /> <br /> Satanic wall-to-wall ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ridiculous rats attack: what else can you ask for? <br /> <br /> This excellent material is almost ruined by the disconcerting soundtrack of synthesizers recorded in the 1980s, which is as unsympathetic to a movie as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear in The Equalizer. It is really bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, they caused Pamela Franklin to crush her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) like the one that can be covered by the Universal Declaration. from the human rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak with her own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything else about this movie if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so, I throw the glove, gentlemen: ANY PERSON THAT TEACHES ME WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN ME ME WITH ME. <br /> <br /> EVEN IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
