You can not imagine how he expected the King of the ants. As a big Gordon fan, I waited for the European premiere with a perverse anticipation. Especially since I loved Dagon, Gordon's last achievement, both. King of the Ants premiered here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him on that later. King of the Ants is his most boring and mediocre movie to date. Actually, the level of quality never exceeded the ordinary standards of suspense films. The scheme of the plot is terribly routine and, with the exception of some bad scenes, Gordon's typical touch is never recognized. On top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a bowl of Swiss cheese! This is a young aspiring thief who has been hired to commit murder. He does so. And, of course, they do not pay him. And, of course, he falls in love with the victim's wife. And, of course, he avenges himself. Only the sequences in which man descends in a spiral of madness are worthwhile. Mention and are the only ones who remind you that you are still watching a Stuart Gordon movie. Acting performances are below average, with McCenna as the hero of the low life, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the opacity of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the makeup effects are not enough to satisfy fans of amateur horror. I read some other comments about King of the Ants, claiming he is Gordon's best, as it is finally a mature and stimulating movie. Well, if that is the case. I prefer to remain immature and give Re-Animator another vision, thank you very much. Oh, well, I think all good directors are left without energy and inspiration. Too bad, he also beat Stuart Gordon.
