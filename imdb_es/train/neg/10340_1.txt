This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I watched it mainly because of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I had not. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, although I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. Does not take the novel into account and changes all kinds of factors. Unless the film was redeemed in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible) I would not recommend it in any way. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. I do not think, as many people say it is, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily impossible to filter, but this particular version could have been made without it. I would almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and a screenwriter who can do it justice.
