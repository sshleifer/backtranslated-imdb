I do not say it because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That picture of the girl washing her hair in the stream? Do we really need to sit there for too long a shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You almost could not see anything and when the characters talked, you could barely hear what they were saying. Have I seen the whole movie? Of course I did not skip most of the time, and I do not want to hear anyone say that I must first see everything to judge it. This film was so poorly made and executed that even with independent and low budget standards it's just terrible. A horrible movie ... do not waste your time with it unless you want to laugh, but even that is not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, but because of the painstakingly poor production it has.
