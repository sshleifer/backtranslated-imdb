The premise of an African-American woman Scrooge in the modern city and in difficulties was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserable banker who takes advantage of the employees and clients in the mostly poor and black neighborhood she inhabits. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban environment of this film, and the script does not make the update work. In addition, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated endlessly, and the public gets tired long before the film reaches its family end. This is a message that does not know when to quit smoking. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson offers an excessively tense performance and, sometimes, the lines are hard to understand. Charles Dickens' novel has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
