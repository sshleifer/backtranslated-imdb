No, this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, the fairy godmother and the crystal slippers, but if I had to explain myself, I would have to spoil it for you, which I will not do. But do not let curiosity overtake you, because this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that start out in a promising way, before betraying your audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent story. And that is a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (A Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is his obedient, obedient and beautiful adolescent daughter. Your relationship is like the hand in the glove, so close that you would consider them more as brothers instead of parents and children. But things start to go wrong (they do not always do) when Hyun-soo's friends, whom Yoon-hee has operated on, start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a warning to the public, and to those Korean ladies who do not bat an eyelid when going through the operating room, if they have to believe the news. The only truly frightening moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, although somehow, I thought that Kim Ki-duk's Time had more gore when he presented and described what happens during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two halves, the fist is an attempt to surprise audiences with standard fear tactics, which, I admit, affected me from time to time. However, the second half degenerated the film into melodramatic mumbo jumbo without meaning, and was quite ingenious in forcing his ideas down his throat. Some things start to make no sense, and while the attempts are always presented to explain, probably do not buy, is not that horror movies are logical to start. <br /> <br /> The tracks are all beautiful, and there is a clear lack of male presence besides the insignificant police role. But hey, I'm not complaining, although the story could have improved immensely. I recommend you see this, only if you're a fan of the mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Beware of those misplaced moments!
