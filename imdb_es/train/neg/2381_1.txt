I'm not surprised that even the cowgirls have the blues if this movie is something to pass. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason why I experienced this experience in the first place. A horrible movie with only music as a redeeming quality. It is a pity that we can not give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
