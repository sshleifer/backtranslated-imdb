I wondered why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until I saw the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and, in general, a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I also did not like the inclination of the plot to overcome the idea of ​​the terrorist threat. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had thousands of warheads pointing to the USA. UU In this film, the idea behind the computer was to kill a terrorist in training before they constituted a threat. Leaving politics aside, one of the good things about the first movie was the fact that even a stupid computer could catch the idea of ​​the futility of war at the end. No such vision is offered in this movie.
