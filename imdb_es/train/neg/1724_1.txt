... and it's this movie. I imagine that if there is indeed a life after the negative death, the damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable sofa and forced to watch this film in a continuous cycle for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not so bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've seen with "Hands, the hands of destiny" ... and I've seen many bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a film of poor quality B, poor production of the film at its best (or is it the worst?) What I really did not like about this movie is the moronic duo that launched for the comedy relief. Now, a bit of comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two idiots, rather than the "heroes" of this movie, who are actually in it for Less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a bad editing job. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie to begin with, so Crown really could not have done much to damage it. <br /> <br /> This really needs to be on the list of the last 100. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my type of campy B film. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my star rating.
