This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's the rock background. The minimum plot involves a gang of cyclists who take over a small town (how original!) And the villagers' attempts to fight them. Why do not they ask for outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it, but both have little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandably) This movie belongs to the garbage!
