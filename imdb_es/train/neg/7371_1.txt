Steven Seagal ... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies have generally been pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect for you in a movie as horrible as this one. Very, very bad taste! I'm ashamed that he even rented this movie. Steven, if you're still acting in films like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" with a few manual maneuvers and clean it ... and also the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this is something else. I'll think twice before renting another movie of yours.
