I'm commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. And from that perspective, I can honestly say that, while it's nice, I can see why it has not been broadcasted recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It is terribly wrong. The actors who played the younger generation were between 15 and 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) was playing Natalie Jastrow, who was supposed to be about 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) was playing Byron Henry, who was supposed to be about 22. The other children Henry, and Pamela Tudsbury, were also played by actors too old for the characters that were supposed to be between 20 and 20 years. <br /> <br /> 2) Part of the performance was absolutely horrible. Ali McGraw sometimes almost makes this mini can not be seen. I have seen more convincing performances in secondary works. <br /> <br /> 3) The address was bad. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the direction. The representation of Hitler was exaggerated. His character looked and behaved more like a villain of caricatures than the charismatic genius, sometimes charming, but always diabolical, that Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) who do not get the depth of character that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very outdated. Hokey music, pretentious narration (it sounded like the narration of a high school history film), and the full sensation of the mini prime-time telenovela made it almost comical at times. In addition, all too often, Byron and Natalie dress and are made to look like 1979 instead of 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who sees this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit on it . , because it will come out more like a prime-time drama of the 70s and early 80s, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of Old and similar movies are sometimes poorly made, but this is probably a case in which a creative and inspired director could make an amazing, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I do not see that happening, since a new version would have to be so long (15 hours) or more to do it right, and given the short attention span of the majority of the current American public, it would not fly.
