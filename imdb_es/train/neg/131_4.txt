So, where are the cannibals? Those who are intrigued by the title and the "real cannibal" appeal of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his visit to a village in Papua New Guinea full of natives, one of whom was his mistress several decades earlier. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is a Jew from New York, and in some way, this is related to the documentary as it appears in his yamika in several scenes. <br /> <br /> Here there are no real cannibals: only stories transmitted by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinematography. Schneebaum is still very nice and gives us a fascinating insight into a life that is as far from Western civilization as can be obtained. <br /> <br /> It's not what it says to be on the cover and in the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
