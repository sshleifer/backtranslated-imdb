What a waste of time. The movie begins as a clone of the Saw series, but with an even worse performance. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, no plot surprises and just a bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I expected everything to come together in the end. It just does not happen. It's a total "Wrestler" that ends with none of the good acting. I can not believe that time has passed watching this. It's not "fun" as some people say. A man with a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to solve it. The connection is a stretch and I should have shot the main actress first.
