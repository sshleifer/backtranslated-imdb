Say ah. Without a doubt, Tommy is the evil one here. I do not know why, but for some reason, young children in horror movies tend to appear as small massacres. and because they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except for the asylum of terror. but those are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway in the movie. Can not you find this movie on DVD? Surely you can! All you have to do is buy the DVD Chilling classics package! Not only do you get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! that wins pff AGREEMENT. I have finished the publicity of these corny movies. Let's say, this movie is not worth $ 15 on its own. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical chemist. yes. Because all chemical scientists look as handsome as this guy who plays Peter. He is trying to reach a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. the university where he works wants to disconnect his project, so he tries to do it himself. but because this is a horror movie, he sucks it out and starts an incredibly long sequence of transformation that takes almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To fill in the movie, he has a relationship with some woman. who has a child and she was never married! scandalous! But, of course, Tommy is one of the most irritating characters ... no. I retract. He is the most irritating character. Much worse than the old cripple who wants to take over Peter's work and gloats when he's in the hospital. That's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the villain. <br /> <br /> So we see that Peter begins to randomly kill some people with the visions he has until he realizes that he is the one doing it and simply decides to kill everyone on his way to return to The normality. However in the end it ends up evolving into a lizard. Yes, I know, do not ask. The end really does not make any sense. And if you are expecting a good reward, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a HORRIBLE movie ... it is frustrating for the lack of a good pay. If you already have the package of 50 movies and this is next on your list, you are not looking for a snoozer, but you are not in a great movie either. Just sit back, relax and eat a lot of snacks. Because this movie will not make you jump skin in the short term. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.
