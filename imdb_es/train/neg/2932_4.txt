Not that he cares, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If it were, there is a good chance that we will face if he continues to make scum this way. The problem is that he found a successful formula like the clumsy and ordinary guy next to Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but he's starting to run out. Here his character has no discernible qualities, is rude and unpleasant, and thinks that it is funny when frankly it is not. When he transfers to New York from London (and I guess this link is meant to attract viewers from both sides of the Atlantic), he is equally out of place with his new colleagues. Still, it's no wonder that among his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting as an act of revenge for his boss. However, somehow, Kirsten Dunst begins to warm up with him, even though he has not done anything good. Oh, and being a superficial man, he falls in love with Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because his character is as superficial as his. Everything is done for a predictable film conclusion, although I can not see any viewer that expresses how this reflected his life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast that is supposedly worth seeing. Pegg, however, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to simply go through the motions, not creating chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. The only big advantage is Miriam Margolyes, as the owner of New York Pegg, now if it had been on the screen for longer ...
