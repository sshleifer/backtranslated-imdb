I'm a big fan of Batman comics and I was disappointed when I could not find more Batman: The Animated Series on TV. I was excited to know that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on television. I saw the first episode the day it was released and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is very poor. It seems a cheap and horrible Japanese anime. On the other hand, almost all the cartoons of today are like that. <br /> <br /> The designs of the characters are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr. Freeze is a dead species with an iceberg on his head and the Riddler is a Goth of Marilyn Manson (which is fun because I do not think people who are obsessed with riddles and riddles are Gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkey / demented wrestler of Bob Marley / Kung-Fu! The Joker is supposed to be Batman's deadliest enemy, but in this program he is hardly a threat because his crimes are so stupid and useless. In one episode, his plan was to put his Joker poison in dog food. Oh, so bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is obsessed by the death of his parents, so he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem obsessed by the death of their parents and it is not interesting at all. He is not a detective either, just a fighter. If there is an enemy that can not defeat, it will not study the enemy to discover its weak points as a detective would, it will simply build a giant combat robot to defeat them. Many times, this program does not even feel like a Batman program, just another animated brainless one that is nothing more than a meaningless struggle. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the villains. They have taken away everything that makes them friendly and easy to relate and have turned them into evil, stereotyped bad guys. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. When you experiment with yourself, you accidentally transform into a giant bat creature. In this program, he is a mad scientist who wants to transform himself deliberately into a giant bat creature without any apparent reason. Almost all villains are like that; none of them, with the exception of one or two, has a real motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a mad scientist, until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the episode "Heart of ice" of BTAS, which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional and pleasant villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as its real origin and was even used in comics as its origin. Even that fucking movie Batman & Robin used it as his origin. In this program, he is a small jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He's still a little jewel thief! Great origin It is not surprising that they used it on the one created by Dini. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I do not like this show just because it's not like the comics because I also liked BTAS, the Batman cartoons that came later, the Tim Burton movies in Batman and, obviously, , the excellent films of Christopher Nolan Batman. None of them was 100% loyal to comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this program is not that it is not exactly like comics or BTAS, but it lacks some kind of depth which makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I have given so many opportunities to this program. But the more I look, the more it seems to disappoint me. I miss the good old days when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.
