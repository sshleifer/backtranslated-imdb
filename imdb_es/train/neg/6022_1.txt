I am getting a little tired of people misusing the name of God to perpetuate their own intolerant vision of the world. Well, I do not rule out the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of the antichrist, but I discard the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives (who seem to be mostly Christian children) go to heaven, while the rest of us must suffer through millennia of hell on Earth, simply because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not believe that He will measure all levels of goodness. Give some credit to the Creator.
