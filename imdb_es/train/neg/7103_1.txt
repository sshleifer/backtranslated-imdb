That's the best way to describe this film that focuses on a couple of newlyweds moving into a house that is obsessed with the first wife of the husband who died in mysterious circumstances. That sounds good and good, but what happens is an hour of sheer boredom. In fact, one of the fun things about this movie is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that promises to anyone who dies of fear a free coffin. Well, trust me, nobody accepted them in that offer unless someone outside is terrified with plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors that touch each other. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music that sounds like it is being played by a sixth grade student. And you will discover the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to ask yourself what people thought in this movie. Someone dies while running and hits his head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end, this is a slow rhythm (which is really bad considering the movie is just over an hour), a boring little story that the average person can easily understand. Apparently, none of the characters in this movie was the average person.
