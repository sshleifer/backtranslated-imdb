Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the summary of a line says it all. The "Le Samurai" by Melville is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better, much better! <br /> <br /> In the "Samurai", Alain Delon is a lone professional warrior / assassin who has a caged bird and is stealing cars for his work (with much suspense in these scenes!). Even the ending is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death with dignity and is shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in him. <br /> <br /> Delon is not killing as many people as the ghost dog. But I guess Jarmusch really liked "Leon" or even "Desperado" from Rodriguez. So he added this, too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon"). <br /> <br /> So, what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the original, the original thought in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can not see the point of making carbon copies (celluloid). <br /> <br /> A 4/10 rating from Macaulay Connor
