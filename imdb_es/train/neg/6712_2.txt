I guess you have to give some points for the courage to write a musical about a history lesson, but how about decent music? <br /> <br /> Is Howard DeSilva's comic performance aimed at arousing the interest of jaded children? <br /> <br /> Is the contemporary acting style (for the time) of William Daniels destined to attract a demographic of the 60s and 70s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the Broadway audience with blue hair laughing at the right moment). <br /> <br /> Sorry, I think the whole piece is outdated, boring and the performance is too strident for the screen
