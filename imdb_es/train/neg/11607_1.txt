I found Horrorvision almost imperceptible. While only 70 minutes I kept pressing the fast forward button again and again. The performance was 'if I scream and say *** much I am an intense school'. And the story was, in the best of cases, a scenario that had not yet materialized. <br /> <br /> Although I never go to the Full Moon to make a good movie, I have never seen them produce a piece of scrap as bad as this one.
