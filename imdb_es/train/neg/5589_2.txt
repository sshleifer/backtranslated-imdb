I was flipping through the list of Richard Burton films when I came to this title that I remember vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember Tatum O'Neal's dialogue that was incredibly bad. I remember that the character of Richard Burton seemed lost, and then I remembered how his motivations did not translate into me. In summary, I remember "Circle of two" because it was tremendously horrible. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared at a time when the United States was going through a period of rather disturbing fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles in teenagers. sexuality. Recall "The Blue Lagoon" (and other annoyances of Brooke Shields), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that seemed to be interested in teenagers who have sex, especially with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found that obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s, created an unconsciously disturbing environment in which to solve everything, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "The Circle of Two" is not execrablely acted upon or is unnecessarily incomprehensible, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it addresses the question of love between the young and the old in a courageous way, if it has totally failed. But honestly, it's one of those movies that you * will * never * see if you did not see it in its first edition because it was really horrible. No one would want this garbage to surface to be publicly distributed again.
