First of all I liked Zombie 2 of Lucio Fulci very much. This movie was absolute trash. I could not bear to see it. The plot was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE BEAUTIFUL AGENTOR THAT BRIDES People come back to life. Anyway, this movie is not worth the $ 1.00 it costs to rent it. I really enjoyed the pike fulci movies but this was horrible. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 will be, I think I will simply omit them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is an amazing fl√≥ tho.
