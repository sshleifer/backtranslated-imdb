Well, I bought the Bloodbath Zombie trilogy thinking it would be a meaningless bloody fun. That's what it is, without the fun. This movie really does not make sense, it's absent from any plot or character development, or any kind of story. The basic problem with this movie is death and gore. Basically, each death looks exactly the same. ZOmbies destroying someone. Yes, that's fine, but you also need some original murders. I mean, it got really bad, all the deaths seemed exactly the same, filmed in exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love Gore, and the gore in this movie did nothing for me. It was just boring. There is no argument, just the same scene take over again and again with a different person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love recordings in video movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not be fooled. This movie has its good points, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped with the flood and that there were more than 100 zombies, which is very good how they involved and helped so many people in the world. But in general, this is a terrible movie.
