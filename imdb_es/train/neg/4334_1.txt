This movie had potential and I was willing to try, but there are so many problems in the timeline that are so obvious: it's hard to swallow being treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is set up in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set between the mid and late seventies. For this film to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not in the late forties. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no trace of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no trace of Kleinfeld, no trace of Rolando with which Carlito supposedly ran at its "apogee". None of the main characters in the original movie was in this movie. We are supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the space of a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking on the beach talking about retiring in paradise, which is what he wanted to do. In the original movie. In addition, the pre-quel creates the characters of Rocco and Earl, what is supposed to happen to them since they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making money making an average gangster movie. and releasing a character named Carlito Brigante in the story. The film had some good moments, but I think it would have been better to let this movie stand alone instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to watch this movie, the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it as the spaghetti westerns with the nameless Clint Eastwood man, in other words, two films that have the same character but are not necessarily connected to each other.
