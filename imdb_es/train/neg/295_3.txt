I got this movie because I worked in a movie store, so I got free rentals. He came in, and the cover made her look good. Hot girl, carrying a gun, okay, I'll check. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad play. This was so horrible, I spent half of the movie looking forward to reach nudity, which was minimal. I think it CAN be three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheesy dialogue, fucking violence, bad excuses of the characters. I feel bad for leaving this movie, because I know it was made with a cheap budget, but so was "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
