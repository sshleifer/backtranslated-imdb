These were more than 80 minutes of semi-unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, when I reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that only a few more minutes were left, and I lasted until the end, which makes me proud to consider this film as a great test for human patience and trash. Was it worth seeing? Well, as I wrote earlier, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you have enough will, you can even last until the end ... The film lacks coherence and the characters seem to have no common sense at all. All the events in the movie, you can be sure of having seen them somewhere before, and it seems that they are included in this movie just to fill the film roll.
