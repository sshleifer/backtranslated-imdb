Manipulative drama about a glamor model (Margaux Hemingway) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon), whom she had introduced by her younger sister (played by her sister Mariel), whose music teacher she is. While the action at the central courtroom attracts attention, thanks in large part to the imposing performance of Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's attorney, the film is often simply brilliant, but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury apparently takes the musician's decision because a) the girl was invited to assault the sensual nature of her profession and b) she was not offering resistance to her alleged assailant when her sister arrived at the apartment and, without realizing it, saw the couple in bed together. What the hell?!; I was clearly tied, what resistance could I realistically offer? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film, which involves Sarandon's rape of the sister, which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE (2002) to occur in a tunnel, is quite artificial: the character of Mariel should have known better I trust Sarandon after what he did to his sister, but Margaux foolishly repeats the line of work that indirectly led her to her humiliating experience almost immediately. However, the climax, in which Sarandon gets his just desserts, with Margaux suddenly becoming an intrepid and intrepid vigilante, pleases the audience in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); By the way, the ubiquitous tycoon of the Italian film Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting how the lives of the two Hemingway sisters had very different twists (this was the film debut of both): Margaux's career never took off (despite her undeniable good looks and her commendable participation here), while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for MANHATTAN (1979) by Woody Allen and, interestingly, she herself would play a glamorous victim of furious violence while rehearsing the role of real life "The central page from Playboy Dorothy Stratten in STAR 80 (1983) by Bob Fosse With the additional pressure of a couple of failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996. Creepy, the Hemingway family had a history of suicides, especially the grandfather of the sisters, the celebrated author Ernest, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961.
