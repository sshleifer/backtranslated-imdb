Do you know those movies that have caught you in the movies? You're stuck there in the best seat in the house, in the center of the row in your own special sweet spot that you exchanged three times before you have the right seat, and after what feels like 13 hours, you're still stuck there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F *** is this movie that will END?" (You know the feeling, think A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q offers a strange variant of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes, wondering when the thing was going to start. It's endless! So "Arty" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've seen. Apparently, he makes movies by a dozen and, if they're all as pretentious as this, I suspect it will be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is among the top 10 directors for me, but Visitor Q is a pretentious, cheap and unpleasant w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have already trained, I hated it.
