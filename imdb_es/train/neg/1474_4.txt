** SPOILERS ** A little ridiculous made for the television movie has the sexy and mature golden seeker Isabelle Collins, Susan Tucci, making a number to every man she comes in contact with in the movie. First conquering their hearts, then their wallets and then, when they are no longer useful, thrown in the wastebasket like a used Kleenex handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The first victim of Isabelle is none other than her abusive, to prevent Isabelle looting her bank account, Stewart, John O'Hurley. It is later in the film when Isabelle becomes very friendly with the former plumber and now the yacht salesman Richard Davis, Philip Casnoff, says that she, without really telling him, has Richard, who is totally in love, to get a contract on his life as unsuspecting husbands. Getting this ex-convict, in fact, as soon as he gets out of jail, Daggett, Nicholas Campbell, to do the job at Stewart Richard soon discovers that he did not receive exactly what he paid, $ 15,000.00 in cash, for. <Br /> <br /> Daggett, a little too greedy, not only blew Stewart's brains out, but he also took a solid gold watch, which Stewart offered him in order to save his life as well. The watch was easily traced back to Daggett while trying to pawn it at a local jewelry store where he was quickly arrested. While Doggett ignores who hired him to beat Stewart, the long arm of the law takes no time in arresting Stewart's by hiring Doggett, killer Isabelle's husband to be former plumber and yacht salesman Richard Davis! The arrest of Davis by the police occurs just as he and Isabelle took the marriage vows in a local church! <br /> <br /> Isabelle manipulates everyone, exclusively men who fall madly for her, to their advantage by getting them to do their dirty work. Always playing the role of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client, Isabelle seems to live an enchanted life always one step ahead of the law and the police. No matter what she does, Isabelle covers her quite well so well that it is almost impossible to pigeonhole her, by making others do it, of the many crimes she commits, through a second part, in the film. <br /> <br /> After fucking, both figuratively and literally, her first husband, Steven, her second husband, for less than ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or Richard's lawyer, Gavin Kendrick, Kamar De Los Rey, Isabelle knows it's only a matter of time before the police become wise to her With the DA getting both Richard and Kendrick to return the evidence against their Isabelle now knowing that everything is quickly approaching her and making her move final. Isabelle and her 10-year-old daughter Ruby, Lauren Collins, by putting everything in order overseas, shoot at the passport office to obtain authorization, passports, to leave the country. <br /> <br /> It is then when the cautious and intelligent Isabelle commits her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the film. Isabelle is told by the passport donor, Don Carrier, that he will have to wait 48 hours for her, and Ruby's, the passport to be accredited! Just long enough for the police to find and arrest you! Extravagant ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic found in a black film or crime film. A final that will not only leave you breathless, but also your concept of what is good and what is wrong in the world.
