Think of this movie as a live action show on Saturday mornings of years ago. Even small tykes will find it difficult to please this one because it works like molasses! I can not fully understand how horrible it is to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the wardrobe department! Too many films of magical warriors have used the same old plot several times, but this is very scarce, considering its appeal to the little ones. And who in the world would have allowed a topless siren to be cast in the first place? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another gem for your 1999 TV season.
