Assuming that this will not end in a direct release to the video, I would have to say that I will void this title at all costs. Unless you're bored with good and well-executed movies, that's it. I saw it last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I did not care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director ... that's uncomfortable). When you can detect an error in the movie just 5 minutes (a shot outside the window before shooting ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), things go wrong. Let's say this is just an indicator of what is to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will spare you all the details, but this is below average in all respects, even half acting. by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect a half-length performance from him. And the scene of the rape ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. NEVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
