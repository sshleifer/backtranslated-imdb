People like me will destroy this movie. It just is not realistic. The plot is incredibly predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens conveniently. Of course, they find the treasure and become immensely rich, and deceive the bad guy. We have seen it a million times before. The writers of this film should think that most of the films that are published are stupid. They must be right because most people liked this movie. I mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure hidden under the Manhattan subway? One would think that with all the work done in the New York subway, that room would have been discovered earlier. And everything that was built during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail? How nice, and I thought that the romance in Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They just fall in love like this, in 2 seconds ANYONE would worry more about saving my own ass and then getting something. To hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Garbage
