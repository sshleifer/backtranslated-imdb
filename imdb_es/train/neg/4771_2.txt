Do not waste your time in this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the vaguest I've seen. Seriously, I have to wonder how the people involved in the making of this film could have seen the final scene and thought, "Yes, now there is an end!" and they patted each other on the back about it. It seemed more to me as if they had run out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have a great touch, but instead, they just let the whole thing fall flat on their face. When the last shot went black and I heard the sound of credit music, I was shocked, I could not believe what I was seeing and that someone might even call that an end. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to rewrite the ending and give it some substance. Seriously, I would really love to have someone who came up with that in a room, look them in the face and say: WTF !!
