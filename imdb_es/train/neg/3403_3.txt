This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In the space. But it lasted, had unpleasant characters and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally thrown into space by a robot friend of theirs (called, appropriately, Jinx). The spatial scenes are long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and are corny or frightening, according to your point of view. Adults will be bored and cheesy, children might be scared since the way it was filmed really leaves a strange sense about it. <br /> <br /> There is a romance in the making, but unlike the shuttle, this never takes off. It's not clear why it's included in the first place, except maybe to add more tension between the characters, but it failed if that was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be peculiar and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is great. But no, she was irritating and of medium aspect. It is not someone you want to go out with, have as a friend or even consider as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really fortunate that he once appeared in films again this performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in Life Cereal commercials, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal kid. It does not fit on the screen and I do not think we can identify with it at home. In fact, he would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
