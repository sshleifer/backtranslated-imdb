... but the problem with this production is that it is far from being a good musical. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can not always expect ingenious teachers like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; however, the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It is deadly boring and not very innovative (with one or two exceptions) and just after I saw it I could not remember a single significant melody, which is quite tragic coming from someone who learned all the Other One Hundred People in three listeners. <br /> <br /> It is also strangely untheatrical. It takes place in an incredibly large stage (one really has to feel sorry for those people in the front rows who broke their necks to see that something happens 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and does absolutely nothing with that. When there's supposed to be a person singing on stage, that's what you get, and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me, as an aspiring theater director, it was almost painful to watch it. <br /> <br /> The fact is that Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture in his works better than these talents can ever approach. And I'm baffled by the popularity of this musical that could be legendary.
