"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related. The pre-sequel is in "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are horror classics of 1980." Demons III: The Ogre "is a very stupid, boring and cheap monster I'm very confused about the writer is" Demons III: The Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are writers of poor quality and stupid that the boring William Shakespeare ghost or demon egg from the spider web or what Huhuhuhuhu made the girl dream.) I'm so sorry, Very, very, very, very boring I bought The special DVD box called "Demons" in the 3 different movies calls "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" do not have subtitles and subtitles The cost of $ 14.99 of the Best Buy store in the city of Downey Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are writers of bad quality that make the stupid movie almost like "Halloween III" does not have Michael Myer's monster, but people use Halloween I'm very confused, I really love "The Demons" and "The Devils 2 are better boring stupid "D Emons III: The Ogre" is not even The "Demons" and "The Demons 2" are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thanks Juan Antonio De La Torre
