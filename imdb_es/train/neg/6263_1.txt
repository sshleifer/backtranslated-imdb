Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of rotten mud from Troma. It is a youthful, careless and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls who spend the weekend in a mansion. The evil assistant of the teacher takes the girls to a strange plan to perform frightening experiments. Using a brain implant, she transforms her victims and her dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of garbage completely braindead that presents a lot of nudity and some corny blood, not to mention a ridiculous musical score. The acting is horrendous and the script is completely incoherent. That is why that piece of garbage is widely distributed is beyond my reach. Avoid it like the plague.1 of 10.
