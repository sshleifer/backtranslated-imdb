This movie starts very VERY slow, but when the action finally starts, it has to continue a little. I could not understand why some of the events happened and many events happened before they were explained, which makes them a bit confusing. The only thing that really has in its favor is the enormous amount of blood / blood it has, although in most cases the special effects are missing. The blood looks like red Kool-Aid. The tearing of the skin sounds like someone is stepping on a pile of sticks. Once again, the story has a sense of amateur, as if the writer did not take long to perfect it. I feel it could be a much better movie if the effects were better and the script was taken longer. Honestly, I wish I had not seen him, not because of the gore, but because I feel like I lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
