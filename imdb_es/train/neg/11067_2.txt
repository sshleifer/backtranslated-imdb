I am a big fan of the true criminal genre, but I could not sit through this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was thought of as erotic, even the porn-flic soundtrack. It could not be seen what caused Dahmer to tick, nor to explore who his victims were. Nothing but "Look how spooky this guy is". And I have to give the filmmakers so much: their Dahmer is the most spooky thing to dishonor the screen.
