If this guy can make a movie, then I can also make one. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie did not have any. I think that class B horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not like to disappoint my viewers. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from doing too many scenes where the hero wakes up to discover that it is just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, considering that the film only lasted one hour, the ratio of duration of sleep to film was quite high. And, if I decide to make a sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not steal any movie like Star Wars or Matrix because I know my budget is small and I do not want to mask my disdain for big-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references to them in mine . <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a pal driver can only be so scary ... at least they turned him into an evil monster before the screen exploded or something. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie extraordinary director.
