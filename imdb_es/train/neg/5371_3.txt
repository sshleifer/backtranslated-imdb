This movie was more of a disappointment. After the very slow start, very intense (and quite bloody), the movie begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves very little time for the explanation, and when leaving the theater I asked myself what this was all about. The characters are still superficial, the story is not convincing at all, most things are déjà vu without signs of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts ... Likewise, the young policeman has to unearth a body. Of course it's night and it rains And he has to do it alone ... yawn! Or the Manifestation of Evil being "Nazis" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. However, there are some nice details, such as the fistfight scene, the mountain views and some gags (running), but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can) it's definitely not worth it.
