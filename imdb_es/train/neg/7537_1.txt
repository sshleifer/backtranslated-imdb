And I thought that The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the best actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrible script, if someone can understand what the hell was the point of that movie, give yourself a pat on the back. It's a cross between The Village and a crappier script. It starts a little calling you attention, and then, as you go into the plot, it just does not make sense, and do not make me talk about the end! What was that? The only thing that makes this film exist is the usual humor of Nicolas Cage, and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five dollars and just go home and turn on something and when someone asks you why, just say the stupidest thing you can think of. and there you are!
