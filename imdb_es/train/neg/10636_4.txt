I really wanted to see this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes vanished. Once again, they lead us to believe that the KGB are a group of inept idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a ridiculous scene in which 4 KGB agents could not handle a CIA agent. I am tired of these biased, unilateral and completely inaccurate representations of the Spy game that developed during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the United States is incapable of making objective films about its participation in WW2 and beyond. Like the pathetic U-571, where we are made to believe that EE. UU Obtained the Enigma machine, again, it is absolutely false. <br /> <br /> For your credit, "The Company" is very well filmed and acted. The places are also exceptionally well made. Alfred Molina performs a great performance like Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this program and, without a doubt, I will end up watching the other 2 episodes, but I really wish that the productions of the United States stop trying to portray their Spies, military, etc. as supermen who are immensely intellectual and physically superior to any other person on the planet. It ages quickly and severely subtracts the possibility of what could have been a 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
