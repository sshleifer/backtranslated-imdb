(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There's something good about this poor man's Pokémon (make that what you want): the opening theme. It has to be the coolest musical theme of any anime television show for fans nicknamed Japanese made for consumers oops-I-mean-the-the-young-fans. Unfortunately, it was necessary to add some kind of show after the opening theme. And they simply could not find something more interesting than people who argue loudly about which letters are better than others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can not imagine why the children would want to sit in a show where the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes occupies 98% of the execution time. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your miserable Pyramid Diamond Animal in one fell swoop! Do not you see you have no chance of winning this battle, fool? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" <br /> <br /> "Oh yes, well, look at this! I'm about to use my Delta Times tie card from Destruction Force, which eliminates each and every one of your Power Munchers and turns your Creature of Uber-Fantastical Doomsday in Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond All Significance Attack.I bet you did not see it coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they do in this program, talk. While in another shitty kid's show he used to watch, namely, the Pokémon commercial phenomenon (every soccer mom's mascot), at least the monsters had the courtesy of doing it from time to time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" en Simply, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange magazine, "simple and boring". Not to mention the long breath (I realize that I am being hypocritical here considering the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I do not know if there is any plot, and the static monsters do not have any of the Pokémon characters. Even when it does not compare to my favorite cartoon when I was a kid, this show sucks. It's involuntarily fun, but not fun enough to be worth seeing. Goodbye, sleep well, dream wet dreams.
