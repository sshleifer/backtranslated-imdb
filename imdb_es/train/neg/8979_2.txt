It was Jon Pertwee who said: "It's very hard to be funny, but very easy to be silly." Well, if that is the case, PASTY FACES is "Very easy". David Baker (as Director / Screenwriter) and his cast seem to have the impression that the comedy involves stealing scenes and style from the top Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping from one side to the other. Very fast way Very loud voice. Alan McCaffrey suffers especially from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to ruin the film because there is not enough film to ruin it. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially in the script. I could not understand why it ended as it did, it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and foolish way. Oh, and other obvious mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US. UU And a green card to be able to work there. This movie would make you believe that you can get off a plane and start a new life in the United States without any authorization. I still get paid for donating blood in the United States. The people I know in the United States and those who donate blood tell me that the payment of donations stopped several years ago, and that you can buy any type of weapon in a gun shop. As far as I know, gun laws in the United States differ from state to state, but no gun shop sells anti-tank weapons on the counter. So we have a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and very unromantic film. Maybe this is a revenge for BRAVEHEART, a very Hollywood view of the Scots? Maybe, but this does not prevent PASTY FACES from being a fucking comedy
