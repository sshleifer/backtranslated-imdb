** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and can take more damage than before. However, the government is reducing the personnel, the project is in danger and the supercomputer that is in the middle of everything feels threatened, so it takes measures to guarantee its own security. Activate and control the UniSols and start chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. The choreographed fight. The story is bad, and soon it drowns in all the fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun to see a fight where you know a part of it is indestructible. Normally you are pretty sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the fights are between two fighters somehow equal. Not where one is indestructible and can not lose. Then fights only become a tool to stretch time. You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to defeat his unbeatable enemies. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is the number of women with little clothes there. Well, there really are not many of them, because the characters are the majority of men (although there is at least one UniSol woman), but almost all women are unnecessarily shown with at least one bra once. The women leaders manage this, but we also go through a strip club (to use a computer, not less) with much more naked women. These moments do not give anything to the story and are only there to try to please the male adolescent audience. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, boring fights. No more no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
