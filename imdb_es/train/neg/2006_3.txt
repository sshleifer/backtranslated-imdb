It would be useful to know why it took so long to adapt a book prepared for the film as "The House Next Door" for film or television. The book was protected by copyright in 1978. One of the reasons could be the problems to design "the house". The house in this Lifetime movie is really so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I do not like horror genre books, but this was hard to leave when I arrived. Through it about ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people looking for something hidden in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some kind of demon (or the demon personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, for the most part it's an unconventional book, and I do not think it's attractive to the people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come with another version of the book in the next few years. A better house ... better music ... a better script and a darker lighting ... it would definitely help.
