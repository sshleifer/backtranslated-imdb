This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Robin Williams fit into the part as a rhinoceros would fit in a tutu, even though his performance was still unfortunate. Kurt Russell was more credible but still it was horrible. The plot left a lot to be desired and the rest of the performance was also terrible. The only thing this movie opposed was the trailer, which helped me lose 90 minutes of my life, which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have one. If not, just be happy, do not do it.
