... THIS IS ONE! Very good premise, from the beginning. <br /> <br /> He has an excellent first scene, he has to give credit where the credit is due. <br /> <br /> It has solid characters and a script decent enough for a ghost story But here are the things that bothered me: whenever the ghosts appeared, which I certainly liked; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing was the relationship of the ghost. Due to the way things happened in the first scene, one would think that their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed a bit too much in the middle that I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not right. BUT then the end is really very good! Sure, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and that's what I liked about this movie in comparison. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a tempered style remakes this movie. <Br /> <br /> The fans of 'Silent Rage' would love this movie.
