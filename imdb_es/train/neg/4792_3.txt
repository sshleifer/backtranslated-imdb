Ghost .... Class. Ghost II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would love to defend this movie, I just can not. The movie seems to have "run out". The first signs are bad when the video has trailers for other films at the beginning (something the others did not have). Too many useless characters, main examples: the child (who is a nut, initially funny, but you soon want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight the balls (I will not work, or rather I should not) and the Blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there is no link for them in the other Fatasms). There is also a great lack of dwarves running. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILER) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie it seems a filling between II and IV, since the additional characters go to the end, so you can continue with the main 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> In general, very, very disappointing. 3/10
