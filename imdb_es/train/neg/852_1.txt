I'm going to keep this short. This "adaptation" of King's wonderful book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson on this site and, as a result, this movie has mysteriously found its way. in the top-250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is laughable like Torrance and also Shelley Duvall. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: stick to the television series ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and the people which says that Kubrick had every right to destroy King's story because King is not ... a good writer should keep checking "masterpieces" like "eyes wide open".
