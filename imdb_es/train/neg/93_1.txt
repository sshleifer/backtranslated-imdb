A woman asks for advice on the way to reach a mysterious city and listens to two macabre stories of the rare local, both related to zombies. But maybe fate has something unpleasant for her too ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must confess, it was so bad that I went ahead quickly through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It works for only 69 minutes, and there are still tons of stuffing. You get a little shaved head doing a lot of push-ups, lots of boring kissing and kissing scenes between silly teenagers (rhyming, hee, hee) and some good examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> As for the title characters, they just have a footnote in the movie. Why, you get more undead action in the introduction than the previous feature! However, considering how pathetic the eyes come out of the basins and the sequences of eating brains (among other 'delights'), it may be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to top it off, it seems I like that it has been filmed on someone's mobile phone for its transmission on Youtube. Shaking camera photos, scratches on the print, blinking lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, and not in 1971. Even the clothes and fashion look are almost three decades outdated ! <Br /> <br /> If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles that have not seen the whole movie, then go ahead. YOU try to sit through it, I bet you will not even reach the first appearance of the smart blue color fans before you make your excuses and leave. It's really ridiculous that anyone has decided to release it, and honestly, you'll have a lot more fun resting your drink on the disk than actually torturing your DVD player with this excuse for horror. In fact, do not be surprised if you pack your bags and leave in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. Have you been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> Q. What kind of horror rated 18 has the woman with a massive sports bra during the mandatory sex scene? Look, the movie can not even understand that part well ...
