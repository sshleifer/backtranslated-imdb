Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst movie ever made. It's fun to laugh at this, while Manos was simply painful to watch. The Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze." The acting (and I'm using this term lightly) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you'll ever see, and you have to watch the garden tools fight to believe. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to see this disaster. This movie gives Mike and the robots lots of ammo to get some of the funniest phrases they've ever made. If you try to see this without the help of Mike and the robots ... God help you!
