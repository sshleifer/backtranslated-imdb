While William Shater can always make me smile with whatever he appears on (and, especially, I love him as Denny Crane at Boston Legal), well, this show is all about the brightness and the girls dancing and screaming and jumping up and down . <Br /> <br /> Does not have anything of the intelligence of Millionaire, none of the talent of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I saw it, of course, just to check it out. I saw it for more than 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best of all was William Shatner dancing on stage. He is a hoot! unfortunately, this program WILL NOT DO IT. <br /> <br /> That's a fact
