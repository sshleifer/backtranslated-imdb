Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoilers on this. Normally I like Robin Williams movies, however, this gem was not one of them. It was cataloged as a thriller of suspense. The night listener was anything less. To be frank, there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 left, for a good reason. The film was, in my opinion, poorly written and directed. The performance was good, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about a narrator who reads a good book of a dying child. However, * insert the ghost here * nobody can verify the existence of children. Then Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, however, all he has is a headache and excuses from the caregiver of the children. That's it, that's all. You wait for about an hour and a half and the movie ends. He had as many emotions and chills as a visit to the dentist's office. The homosexual nuances, or nuances, really had nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a bit of blasphemy, but it seemed to have been thrown in there for no reason and made little sense. In conclusion, I really can not write a decent review about this film because I had nothing, it was as captivating as watching the paint dry. I gave it a 2 because the performance for what it was worth was fine and was not directed by Uwe Boll.
