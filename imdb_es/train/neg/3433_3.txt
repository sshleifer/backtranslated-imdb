It's such a strange movie, you can say it's horrible or if you sit down with friends it can give you a killer laugh. The strange comes to mind again and again. Amateur shooting, he acted even worse and directions, maybe none. The special effects are fun, but the music that accompanies a baby flying demon will surely be the biggest success. See him if he has time to kill. But do not do it, do not even try to take it seriously. It is supposed to be a tribute to the holocaust of porn. Since I have not seen it, from the tribute I can assume that it is so bad. I should have given it 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets an excessive 3. Gore, the only thing someone worked on. Stay away if you are apprehensive, more gore than laughter. I wonder if the manufacturers laughed doing it?
