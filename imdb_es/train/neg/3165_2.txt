This movie was terrible. I thought that with all the decent actors, it would be better. Do not waste your time Eva Longoria Parker was horrible. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming an actor B the mess he made in the movie that I could never be your wife was the epitome of what I'm saying. and Lake Bell was cute, but I definitely needed more acting lessons. Look like the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a little better. or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful that you did not waste your precious time. PS: I love you too is a good beyond serious romance! It's time to start watching movies with a rating of over 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it.
