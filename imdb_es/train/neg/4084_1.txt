From time to time you listen to radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can not stand or have never seen until the end. This is the movie I think of ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a play by Shakespeare. I'm not sure, but I think I left in this movie for 20 minutes at a time ... I think I realized that my toenails would not be cut, and they looked at me imploringly for me to get cut. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed boring and pretentious. <br /> <br /> Even though this is the first movie I have given such a low score (which I actually tried to see), I would not. I want to get you out of other movies by your English director, Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover" was a really fantastic British movie, although its content sometimes turned his stomach, a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people would resist to see it . <br /> <br /> Another good Greenaway movie was "A zed and two noughts". Once again, it had content that exceeded the limits of good taste, but it was still intriguing. <br /> <br /> The other movie that I usually think about too late for these radio show topics is "Brazil." I never got to see him all the time while I was sleeping! <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for important films that are very stylized, laborious and difficult to follow, then get clear of the prosero books.
