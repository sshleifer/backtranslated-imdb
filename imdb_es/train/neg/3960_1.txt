Hi, it may be because I'm not a great theater actor or a sophisticated movie viewer ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie by Charles Bronson and it's title ... but wow, what a waste of time ... just seeing 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ... <br /> <br /> The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... hard to see the damn movie ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they're putting it on a DVD, then they should do a remastered digital. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was totally surprised to see these high IMDb ratings for this movie ... as I said before, I am not as sophisticated as the other people who commented on this movie before.
