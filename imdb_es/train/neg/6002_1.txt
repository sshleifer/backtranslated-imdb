"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is garbage. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are not interesting. The only scary thing about this scum is that most of the IMDb users gave it a 10. This is really horrible. The gore, the suspense, and the violence are not completely wasted. Nada Cambe ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder"), the cast is also terrible. Yes, some people may like this photo, especially a conventional society, but terror fans or hunting geese will not enjoy this shit. Personally I hate horror comedies, I prefer to watch horror movies like "Holocaust cannibal" or "Last house on the left". In my opinion, a real horror movie is supposed to be terrifying, excessively bloody and disturbing, with no stupid humor, which generally ruins the whole concept. This is not scary, it's not bloody, it's not even funny like a comedy. Do not waste your precious time.
