Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the ADA Laws and Order and her performance is even worse here. His attempts at Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Neither can adequately summon the intense emotions necessary to play the mother of a kidnapped child; Sometimes, while her daughter is missing, she manages to sound vaguely annoyed, as if she could not remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important real story, so it's a shame that the horrible actress's main act distracts a lot from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they simply can not get over Rohm's tendency to simply lean on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern accent when real acting is required.
