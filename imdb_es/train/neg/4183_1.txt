If it were not for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this B movie would not have been worth a section of my Tivo album space. At what low rent, in the back warehouse was the supposed spaceport recorded? "People of continuity" is a basic principle in the realization of real movies! At night, an alleged spaceport and by day (night and day in a space station?) A warehouse? The people please! The only thing I would recommend to this movie is the wardrobe department. Continuously, keeping Natassia in those tight and revealing suits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into, every day of filming! The science fiction channel would have been better at showing SpaceBalls! At least, there would have been a certain humor in seeing something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please dismiss your agent as soon as possible! You are a much better actor, even to be associated with this level of film making.
