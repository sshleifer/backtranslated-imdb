I saw this movie when it was released for the first time. The memory of how bad he was stayed with me almost forty years. I did not want to trust my own feelings about the film when I saw it, so I consulted a review of a movie published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day. The opinion was confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, indecipherable and boring. . A little research reveals that the producer was the husband of the star Leslie Caron, so the feeling of nepotism suggests the beginning of this horrible movie. The film list of many capable actors (Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking, among others) suggests that it is promising. But the death of this film is attributable to its terrible script. The "mystery" involved is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is perplexed from scene to scene. The film seems divided between being a mystery of detectives and an espionage thriller, but never relies on one or the other. The sense of suspense is totally absent. The main characters decide to play dry and emotionless types in a way that does not inspire empathy. Cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the helpless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot and, in the end, the film itself. I'm a little surprised that there is not a version of this pathetic movie available to buy. I hope that if TCM finds an impression of this film and feels compelled to broadcast it, it will be safely relegated to the 4:00 am slot.
