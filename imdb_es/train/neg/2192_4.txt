Another movie that is based on the worn-out cliche clich√© of the mad scientist became more insane. The film focuses on a surgeon whose ambition in life is to return the dead ... to life. I know, I know ... you've never heard that before! Of course, as all these movies go, the experiment goes very wrong and creates a maniac creature thirsty for blood. For this promising setup, you would think that it would be, at least, a bit of suspense. Incorrect. Like many films of this era, the idea is good, but the execution and the script are mediocre. It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems either.
