Let's cut to the chase: this movie is softcore pornography marketed to the masses with the name that the studio is milking every penny of the American Pie tit. Period. <br /> <br /> The complete plot (and that should not imply that there is much to go) serves as a vehicle to show the public more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween guy and you're too sensitive to buy real porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the movie does not have much to offer at all. <br /> <br /> The performance is unsatisfactory, the development of the character is practically nonexistent and the story is a knot with no sense of nudity, excessive consumption of alcohol. and jokes (none of which are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are excellent cinematographic works, and they all contain excessive use of alcohol and nudes. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much, it's how you use it"
