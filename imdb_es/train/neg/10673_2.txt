This movie was like a bad indie with a first class talent. The plot was silly, until the end. It reminded me a lot of something that happened in the home video market in the eighties. I would have given him one, but there were brief moments in which the actors could be seen really striving to make this worthwhile. I think the worst thing was that the underwater scene remained outside the pier. The underwater lighting seemed to come from nowhere, and every time someone we had to worry about was about to run out of air, this air tank seemed to appear. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
