Although BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES is a bit more technically polished than the previous film in the series, this is a weaker adventure in both a plot that is less exciting and a protagonist who simply does not have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> <br /> That said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag moving. Also John Barrymore is present, appearing throughout the film with a variety of extravagant costumes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's another interminable night for BD while he and his cohort pursue trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but, again, the supporting actors make them entertaining.
