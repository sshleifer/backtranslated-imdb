This movie is just lame. A total loss of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√© and the way they talk about role players is not so fun. The problem is that writers do not seem to know how a role-playing game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a lot of losers who play role-playing games, such as delays and total losers. But for me, this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story does not make any sense at all. Who cares how long a game is played? The biggest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors did not even try to know which RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt embarrassed to see this movie lame.
