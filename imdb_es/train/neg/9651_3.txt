The movie is total shit. We have two good actors who are miserable and an actor's boss, Salman Khan, just to attract the female audience. History is crap. The badly drawn characters. Storytelling does not exist There is no edition to talk about. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... that's a dream in itself. The film crawls to the point of decay. The whole farce about Arjun bringing his Manna to London, groping him with his girlfriend and not playing in Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. The fact that Salman Khan acts exaggeratedly or falsely is too painful to see. I remember seeing some good films by this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all good directors are falling for the box office craze ... that the Mumbai media has created. This is another fucking movie in the lines of "Wanted" with an idiot actor like Salman Khan, who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good for Indian cinema as Titanic went for the winter cruise business. On a positive note, I like the character of Asin dancing Bharatnatyam when he changes to western style of dance when the teacher is not watching.
