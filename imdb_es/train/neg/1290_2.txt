This movie lasted two and a quarter hours. Someone, please, tell me what it is. <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical context. It is supposed to be a group of Confederate raiders (terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border, who avenge all the supporters and abolitionists of the North during the Civil War of the United States. But apart from gratuitous violence, this movie did not make much sense. Maybe it was a political statement? Is not that war really more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point, it was pretty good, but I do not think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a movie that was worth it here, but as far as I'm concerned there was no plot. It seemed that I was watching a pocket novel come to life, with the characters as they were on the covers of those novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should burn along with some of the cities in this gang. Burned
