This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. The Avengers celebrated this dubious honor? but not anymore The performance in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. He does not know if he wants to be an S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Just look under extreme poisoning or if you are lying down and need a leather distraction. This script should be reworked in a pornography, it would not require much effort and it would have a longer lifespan. A porn, even a bad pornography, would not hurt Dolf Lundgren's career the way this movie has done.
