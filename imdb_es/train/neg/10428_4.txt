Did anyone else feel as betrayed as me? The first hour or so was pretty solid, but the last. Oh my God. It seemed like it was predictable and corny. Not great and epic like the whole career of the show has been. Most of the reviews have read, but I really do not understand why. I had seriously predicted the general ending of WAY ​​before, but then I retreated because I thought: "No, they would never do that, that's too lame". I can hardly stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm about to go out the door to sell every season I have. Someone please. Change my mind I want to love this. Very bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Big show. Terrible final.
