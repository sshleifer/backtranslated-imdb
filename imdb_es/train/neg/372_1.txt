I've watched this movie for a long time, and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This is a film about Preston Waters, a preteen of bad luck, who always seems to be overlooked by his Family and who always seems to lack cash. All this changes when a bank robber passes over Preston's bike and passes a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says he is working as an assistant to a rich and mysterious patron named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy with money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on the screen, it's one of the emptiest movies I've seen. On the one hand, it is too incredible. I know that some parts of the film were meant to be incredible, but I refuse a twelve-year-old boy who dates a thirty-year-old woman and handles the small fortune of an imaginary person. In addition, this was a superficial film with a weak performance, a predictable plot and characters that are less memorable. The characters were corny, exaggerated, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
