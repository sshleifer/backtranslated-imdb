This film, I will not call it "film", was basically about nothing and it worked mainly for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this movie gave great pleasure to the troops and our audiences. <br /> <br /> but let's have something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing a young Buddy Rich on drums. The music was good everywhere. <br /> <br /> but one cameo after another quickly ages. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! so if you are one of the "best generation", as they say, you will definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
