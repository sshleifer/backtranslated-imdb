"It's not like that big mechanical toy," says one character from the beginning, commenting on "Jaws." Well, "Blood Surf" would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark in the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Acting and directing are not much better either; they seem more suitable for a deodorant or a chewing gum commercial than for a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the audience. Saying that you "liked" this movie only encourages the filmmakers to offer us more of this shit, further destroying the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
