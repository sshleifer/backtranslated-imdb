To 1957 (yes, that's the correct date) the production of J. Arthur Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; It has to be a great comedy, right? Oh, it's just horrible. It's a joke movie: to see people be surprised to see a small alligator. Music is thrown in the most inappropriate and forgettable way. Jeannie Carson is a competent dancer and singer. But what was she doing in this movie? Diana Dors is also here, providing incredible photos to use in the previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to provide someone to look at her. Well, one must do something besides moan during this movie. The movie is being sold on VHS now by people in e-Bay. Save yourself the expense and waste of time. A comedy without laughter. A musical without a memorable song or dance.
