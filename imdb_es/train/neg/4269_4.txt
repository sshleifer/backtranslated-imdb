Sometimes, a premise starts well, but due to the demands of going overboard to meet the demands of an audience that suffers from attention deficit disorder, it becomes an incongruous disaster. And for three very respected actors who have done a better job before and after, this is a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So let's see. Premise: A loving couple who lives in a beautiful house is threatened by a bad policeman. Interesting to say the least. Make the invading policeman a bit disturbing, why not? It was well done in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRIB AND A SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and is a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now here is the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that really bothers to bring a real threat to its main characters without ever going so far as to seem ridiculous, or throw something similar to reality, amplify the shock factor, and make this policeman so extreme: an ultra bad variation of all the other super villains that come to the cinemas from the silent era. <br /> <br /> The producers and directors chose the latter. This is the resulting film: badly done, with actors who do everything possible to make faces or roles in the roles they have rehearsed before, and nothing that amounts to much less.
