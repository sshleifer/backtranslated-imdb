Ingeniously directed, ingeniously directed comedy, which supposedly falsifies the classic "alien invasion" movies "50", but in reality it is not better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (effects of good makeup). And any parody that is worse than its objective is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of listening to the shrill voices of the aliens, you will be asking for peace and tranquility. (* 1/2)
