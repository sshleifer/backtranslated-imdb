The basic formula for the original series was; Take someone, make the audience like them, then put them in mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now, we advance 40 years until 2004 ... We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a less than diligent college student, with his friend Fermat, a young know-it-all. . Lady Penelope took them in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the paradisiacal island where the Tracy family lives, during the school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in charge of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5, which was damaged by an accident on the scene. All this is part of The Hood's plan to take over Tracy Island so it can steal Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The argument is as loose as that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the performance more of wood than that of the puppets (fiberglass), the effects, anything less special and the Hans Zimmer score. What little there was of the glorious theme of Barry Gray shone through Zimmer's lackluster orchestration. The rest of the score was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and he did not recognize it. I did not even bother staying to witness Busted's mediocre efforts with the final titles. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked quite well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material, they could have been show stoppers. The work of CGI was what would have called vanguard - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamic of the main ship was wrong; The models of the original series at least moved as if they had mass <br /> <br /> Another delicate point is that the whole production seemed to be a long set of product placements, from every vehicle that Ford was building to all the content of the Tracy Freezer produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', aimed directly at his age group, did not add anything to the legend of the Thunderbirds. When Star Trek came to the big screen in 1979 with 'The Motion Picture', a new life was breathed into the franchise, which then continued for another 20 years. With this film, Frakes has lost a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, like 'The Avengers' and 'the Saint' before it, will sink into darkness within 6 months, leaving the original series to its "classic" state.
