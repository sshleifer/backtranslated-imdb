The worst, and full of people that really should know better, (the cast has six Oscars among them). It is set in 'contemporary' Africa (it was created in 1979), and deals with the slave trade. It is terribly scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach a low point in this race), and completely devoid of emotion, regardless of the moral approach. It is also ridiculously hatched. You do not believe for a minute that any of the characters would behave the way they do in these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs, but you get the impression that it was over the phone. This is as bad as it gets.
