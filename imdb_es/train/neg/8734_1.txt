Maybe I've seen too many crime movies, or maybe I do not take the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most clich√© movie, poor plot, absurd plot, just stupid that I have. seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the address, it seems that it took less time to show this than to put it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that to go directly to the video before it was completed. <br /> <br /> It's a bad "M" scam, the classic Fritz Lang movie starring Peter Lorre. You would be much better renting that.
