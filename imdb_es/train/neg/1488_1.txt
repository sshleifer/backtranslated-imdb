I had to register in IMDb just to post a comment about how horrible this movie is ... my cats and a string ball have a better story than this one. It's not the worst performance I've seen in my life, but when you eliminate almost the entire cast of the film in 5 minutes, it leaves a lot to be desired. There was not a single moment of 'fear' in the film, with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on television. Around me, it seems like it could have been a good story, shooting the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a small loss, since I did not recognize her immediately and her scene was over before I could have said 'oh Yes, there she is. ' I am very happy to have seen this at a hotel and I did not pay for it, since it would be really marked if I had paid a penny to see this. Normally I like it or at least I can find a redemption factor in a movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even so funny, so good, it's bad, it's just bad.
