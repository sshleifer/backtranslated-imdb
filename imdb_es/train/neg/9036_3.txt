I can not believe I'm wasting my time looking at this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin awarded him an "AA" rating, and for television movies, this is usually a reliable indicator of quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The action was correct, but whoever wrote it must be denied access. To any means of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivations of the "bad guys" are totally absent, and the various family interactions are silly and superficial. For example, Dad preaches that the violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be an "admirable" person NOT because of his philosophy of "ignoring idiots", but because he is pretty good with his fists ... <br /> <br /> The ONLY message that I could deduce from this document was that the nuclear family is Good and that alternative housing arrangements are Bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
