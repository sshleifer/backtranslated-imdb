Alexandra, my 10-year-old daughter, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of "101 Dalmatians" things. I could not wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits at the beginning, they were cute and well made. It's not worth seeing the rest of the movie. Thank you.
