A movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword. I've seen Schlock in my time, but after seeing the unfortunate disaster, I think I'll never be able to watch another movie again. May God have pity for the souls that did this. <br /> <br /> Premise- Silent stallion of the ex-army, model character in underwear (actually acted well) goes to look for the girl who sent her a Christmas card while serving in the army. He lands with his cabin, granola-type family, who are loggers from the right. The family approaches him and it takes us 2 hours of our time for the chick to see that he is better than his liberal, drinking French wine, driving porsche, talking on the cell phone loudly, lazily, the slippery city, promised Jewish. <Br /> <br /> Bad-1d characters, themes 1d. Being hit in the head with the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner <br /> <br /> The good commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. Finished.
