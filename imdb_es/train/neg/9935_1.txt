It completely defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously, and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as a filmmaker and as an "intellectual" polemicist. It's hard to believe that Godard really believed everything the Marxists and Kant Maoists. Anyone with half a brain could solve the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and continued to destroy, even while Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs that read tedious political diatribes to your audience, and then, when you could not think of anything else to do, add another voice-over to the first voice-over, which would have lost your listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he does; you would not do that? It was the only guarantee that such stupid crap would be seen in the first place: the Stones' genius overshadowed a stupid, babbling, political idiot with a camera. The bookstore scene was not even worthy of the worst marginal theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence of even the small children who were used to playing in it, as you could easily see. Putting aside by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this shit without art was a satire in conventional film is no more than a sure outlet to offer to those who clearly see the poverty of Godard's intellect and arrogant disdain for his audience . It is ironic that Truffaut, Godard's only great friend with Nuit Americain, has made the best film about filmmaking and Godard has done the worst with Le Mepris. By the way, Godard did not choose the track of the Stones of Sympathy With the Devil. It happened to be the track they were working on when the 'movie' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
