All I could think about while watching this movie was a grade B grade. Many have spoken of its redeeming quality; this is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and of an individual and their subsequent spiral into a state of self perpetuation of unfortunate events. However, in reality, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and, therefore, were not convincing and irrelevant to the film in general. and convoluted. You can read most of the other reports about this movie and they will say more or less the same as me. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but when faced with such a boring action ... looks can only bring a movie so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few blows thrown here and there, and a final shooting towards the end. There really is nothing to highlight. <br /> <br /> As others have said, the "BAD" movies are great to watch for the same reason that they are "bad", you delight in that fact. This movie, however, is a void. Is nothing. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if one really needs an educational film to scare people and leave them without the use of drugs, then I would seriously recommend any number of other films that address those issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Theathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just some examples. Although you should also see some more cheerful films about the same subject, like 'Go' (in general, serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'. <br /> <br /> In a final note, the one that possibly redeems the line in this film, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been contaminated by 'Loaded' is vile. <br /> <br /> In general, I suggest you save money and time by NOT watching this movie.
