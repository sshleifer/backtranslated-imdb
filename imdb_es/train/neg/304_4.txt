This film presents Ruth as a female figure, athlete, athlete and overeating with a bit of baseball. The early life of Babe Ruth was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes and was omitted in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well-known relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been better covered than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many of the greats of baseball modeled later in their lives. I feel like I'm being fair with the memory of a great baseball player that this movie completely ignored. Pity to the creators of this film to capitalize on its flaws and not its greatness.
