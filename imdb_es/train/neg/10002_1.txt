I'm sorry everyone ... I know it's supposed to be an "artistic" movie, but wow, they should have delivered weapons in the screening so that people could blow their brains and not watch. Although the design of the scene and the photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful to see. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. The shots were too long. How long can you see two people sitting and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. It really cost me a lot to finish this movie. The performances were excellent, but how many of those dark, dark, uninspired things can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and the dance scene. Otherwise, this was a Bergman scam. And I'm not a fan of him either. I think anyone who says he enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is, well, lying.
