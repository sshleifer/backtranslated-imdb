My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle: a strong-willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was a must for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character we fail to see. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were worried about the episode in which she tries to hide from her. Mother the fact that she is locked up. But the decisive factor was the episode in which she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but tells her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do those things? The answer is that she would not do it. In addition, my husband and I select the bad guy with almost perfect precision. It is almost always a white man or woman who appears in the cameo scene at the murder scene or in an idealized family. Can not the writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer spectators. We prefer programs that do not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
