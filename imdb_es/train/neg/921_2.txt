I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time. She can act, but she has no chance in this pileup. The opening sequence is a crane made from mountain landscapes. It must come from a stock file, because the movie is recorded directly in video. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a very cheesy animated statue, but there are no other noteworthy effects. This movie is bad, but not so fun. Players would do well not to mention it in their resumes.
