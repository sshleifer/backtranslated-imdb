** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unreal, it has no plot and, basically, it was only made to see the stars represent themselves. The most suspenseful scene of the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing PSYCHO's shower scene. This film really hoped that the users believed that the character of Naseeruddin Shah has a memory good enough to remember where certain shots were made and how many! <br /> <br /> *** THE SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the assassin pours his entrails towards Shabana Azmi long enough to allow the character of Naseeruddin Shah to hurry and shoot him. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** <br /> <br /> At first it's a bit funny (just a little) to listen to the director and the cast members throwing insults and listening to Shabana Azmi exclaim: "Oh sh-t!" <br /> <br /> In general, a Baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of ********** (2 of 10)
