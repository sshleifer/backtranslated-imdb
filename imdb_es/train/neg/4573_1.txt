I did not know much about this movie before I saw it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics, so I became interested. What I did not know is that this is NOT REALLY A HISTORY, but a group of New Age fans who love the sound of their own voice and talk about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it belongs more to the Documentary category than to Comedy or Drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the film, to give this New Age symposium * a kind of story. Their parts of the film feel horribly stuck and are meant to show the speaker's thoughts so that we do not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie who crashes on her couch. We hear people without a name rambling about what quantum physics "means" to them. The only bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India (I suppose), but I think he showed up for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden really let go and she goes on and on. about how quantum science has something to do with your crazy New Age beliefs. It seems that Quark of DS9 was running out of money and also made a brief appearance in the movie. There is a lot of CGI whizbang that we are supposed to impress with; The cells in the body are shown as dancing gelatin molds, because the filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber too many times. <br /> <br /> The people in the film say that the Arawak people in San Salvador thought that the Columbus ship, the Pinta, was invisible. because the natives had never seen cut boats before, as if today's people had some way of knowing. Of course, they omit all that information and only say "Columbus's ships were invisible to the Indians in the United States." The film has many such arrogant leaps. Thomas Young conducted a double-slit experiment around 1805 and discovered that light can look like a particle at some time and a wave at some point. Of course, you would never know for watching this stupid movie because the only reference to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves". And that must mean that people can go through walls, walk on water and never get old if they just want a star! So, I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed enough. I'm being sarcastic, but this movie is full of false hopes and beliefs that the people who defend them really do not have. <br /> <br /> These are the New Age villagers who have taken over Quantum Theory as if reaffirming everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil sellers really believed in the trash they were selling, could not they just "want" their paychecks instead of appearing in this joke of a movie? We can hear another man without a name, without credentials we know, talking on his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen he wanted someone to hurry up and throw a cake in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Another type of baldness in a suit says that nobody ever * really * touches anything because there is a magnetic force that prevents it at the quantum level. If only someone had walked on the screen and continued to hit him in the stomach, shouting "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you!" A moral relativist in the movie claims that there really is "no good or bad thing". So apparently it's OK for Hitler to kill millions of Jews? Another person says that "there is no love". It's just a chemical and we do not really love people, we're just addicted to the chemical fever we have when we're close to them. I suspect that this guy is making this movie as a community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence in which two young adults walk around a wedding, seeing everything as RoboCop. They evaluate whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual position appears on the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she is supposed to photograph and the next day she decides to love herself and take a bath because it is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the movie said that people often find evidence of His preconceived notions. Maybe in this review I'm just seeing what I want to see, but I REALLY wanted to see these people get pastels in the face, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of any. From the ideas presented in the previous film, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to see a good movie that talks about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, go see the man who was not there. If you want to read a good book on Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a movie that talks about different philosophies with imaginative images, see Waking Life (although sometimes it may seem boring, important and pretentious). In general, you should go read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time in this movie. <br /> <br /> I usually have a hard time giving the movies a score of 1 to 10, but this was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is true. The people in this movie do not know # $ *! Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life.
