I saw this movie by accident and this movie was an accident ... well, it must have been like that. the blonde women were harassed, the villain appeared and then disappeared going from one place to another in a matter of minutes, then disappeared and reappeared, hiding. He was not even a super hero, so I do not know how he did it. I could not scare anyone. Cat and that's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary, in fact it stopped being so for years. you had the police behind the villain's trail, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, is from London) the director had no idea and made a film full of fearful movements and clichés "that was a comedy It was scary, pathetic!
