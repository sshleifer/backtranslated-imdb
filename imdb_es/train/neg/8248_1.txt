There have been more interesting Polish documentaries about the breeding of worms, in brail_ !! The competition (growing worms) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after seeing this movie. The unfaithful husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in all the meanings of the word. Poor Jennifer really needs the job, and what it was with the accent! The random locations and meetings reminded me of a high school joke and showed the humility of a 10 year old in the cooking class. It was so bad that I think I'll write the sequel called "this is not a laxative." Thanks for listening, it was a great weight of my conscience.
