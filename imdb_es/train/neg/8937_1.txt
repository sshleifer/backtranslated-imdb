Usually, I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the box of a pound in the hand of my friends. We sat down to see him, ready to scare us and we ended up spraying food everywhere, we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but I do not know why they decided that number ten in the series would be lucky. The worst of the movie are the actors. The camera work was deficient, the special effects are not really bad if I'm generous, but in general, the story did not connect at any level because the actors were as effective as a small lump of charred elm. They were wooden beyond measure, especially a fifteen-year-old actor who was too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. In fact, he looked more like a child in a public school. There was a very funny sex scene where he looked like he was looking for apples while a busty lady was riding on him and then his diaper-sized underpants were hysterical, but then I remembered that it was not supposed to be a comedy. I am desperately tearing up my brain to find something positive to say about this movie, apart from the occasional flash of the breasts, but there simply is not. Hopefully the lucky number is ten and do not do another, I'm not sure my ribs can stand it.
