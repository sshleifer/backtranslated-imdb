It's strange that less than 2 hours seem like a lifetime if you sit through flat and uninspiring nonsense. If a story is as personal as it was supposedly for Sally Potter, would not you expect it to show some passion in her performance? His performance was completely distant and I did not feel that the chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been ardent given the nature of the dance, was somewhat uncomfortable and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story in a movie can be daunting, and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take care of the task instead of letting her passion fall victim to her own shyness.
