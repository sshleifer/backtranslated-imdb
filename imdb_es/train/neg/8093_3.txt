Based on Tom Wolfe's satirical novel that was praised by everyone (I have not read it yet) Tom Hanks plays a man on the street who accidentally kills a black boy while he was lost in a bad part of the Willis stars like the reporter who begins to Hanks in his downward spiral .. The characters are very thin and it seems that there is no empathy for anyone in this film and for a comedy or a satire there is also not much laughter ... Melanie Griffith made her breasts during the filming , so it's a fun thing to do is see if her tits change size in different parts of the movie ... This will keep her mind away from other things like lack of script or humor. On a scale of one to ten.
