This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such recognition was strictly due to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I am not a negative type of man, but the man who acts in this film is ... without comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I regret having had two hours of my time and my money wasted in this movie. I still love the original and I will do everything possible so that this film does not ruin my opinion about it.
