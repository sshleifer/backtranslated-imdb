First, this movie reminded me of the old movies I used to see in religion class at school. That is NOT a good thing. Basically, it's just a preaching and a presumptuous piece of filth, like the terrible "Left Behind" series. Religious films do not offend me ... but they offend me when these religious films are extremely terrible. I would like to be able to say nice things about a Christian movie, but that does not seem to happen soon. I bet if you gave the Bible punchers a decent budget, they still could not come up with anything good. Just avoid this one. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically, the failures of Reverend Wildmon) is broadcast about this movie on their website is another reason to make me hate. In fact, after seeing this, I went home and saw my copy of the "Accident" NC-17 by David Cronenberg. Forgive me father because I have sinned. Hahaha
