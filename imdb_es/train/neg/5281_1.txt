The humor in Who's Your Daddy is in such bad taste that I closed my eyes in certain scenes. The close-ups of the semen are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so coarse and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching Who's Your Daddy gave me an unpleasant nervous feeling.
