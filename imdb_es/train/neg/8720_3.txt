Put aside the replay of Dr. House I had missed, and some Desperate Housewives (new) to see this. I do not know exactly what this film plagues. I never thought I would say this, but I want to recover my 15 minutes of fame. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can not say it. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but I thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and I sat down for a good cheese movie. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "girl from the office" does with the 029 keypunch and puts the letters in a 087 classifier. LOL @ "the computer". I would like someone to identify the following device: a 477? It is even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we, the dinosaurs, do not have much time to waste.
