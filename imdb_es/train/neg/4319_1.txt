I'm sorry, but I'll ruin the plot line and the end for you in the hope of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one I now face. The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... and Dad does not. Dad is peach, happy, healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died. Everything ends sweet as a syrup. <br /> <br /> But as a father who recently saw my five-year-old son lose his best dog friend, it was a horror movie. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to get his mate back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will power of a young heart, no amount of persuasion will convince you that it was just a movie and that your dog will NOT be back for Christmas. It has been heartbreaking to see her joy just to know that Christmas Eve will have to face her loss again. <br /> <br /> Embarrassment of you on behalf of all the believers who have recently lost a loved one. It is hard enough to deal with the loss once for a child, but there are some desires that we should not even describe as a possibility.
