... it may seem far-fetched ... but there really was a real life story ... of a man who had an affair with a woman, who discovered where he and his new wife were staying, and she killed the wife , so it looks like a murder rape ....... <br /> <br /> in her deception she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him ... so she resigned to his work in Wisconsin ... and I moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> the last time I knew I was in a mental institution, Security Prison ... < br /> <br /> she still wore the "engagement ring". that she bought for herself ... and told everyone that he had bought her for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ... and the murder occurred. in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even an outstanding story in the magazine "People" ... Spring of 1988, I mean on page 39. I remember this when I was in college in that moment, and a colleague of mine had met the person at the Security Hospital ...
