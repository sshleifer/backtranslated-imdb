Only for Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good, one where you make a number with an elderly cleaning lady (you have all seen the photos) and a pretty good number at the end. There are a couple of scenes where the lines are fun. But, basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so old that it's hard not to be ashamed of how horrible it is. But it's worth the movie rental of 2.50. Be prepared to move quickly.
