If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in the negative numbers. While I respect the fact that someone has to keep doing these terrible "horror" movies, seriously, buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that you could be spending on something much more valuable than your time. <br /> <br /> Although it is a horror movie, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of ​​seeing how many clichés of horror you fit into a movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it would probably have been a better long-term movie. <br /> <br /> Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you fucked up. The actors probably could have done a decent job if it were not for the questionable scripts. This was a terrible waste of a movie trip. I would prefer to go again and see "One Missed Call", at least that had some plot.
