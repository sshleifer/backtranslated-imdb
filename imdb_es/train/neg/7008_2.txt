Annie Potts is the only highlight of this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really upset because someone stole the Corvette, he and his classmates became a hotrod (possibly the car with the ugliest aspect of a movie), and heads to Las Vegas with Annie to locate him. the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have ripped my eyes out after seeing this if it was not for the fun of seeing Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for Hamill that he did not take some acting lessons from her . Danny Bonaduce also makes a ridiculous cameo.
