A horrible movie! It must have been against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They have taken the story of the first famous Renaissance painter and have destroyed it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that liberties have been taken with the facts; If the story were good, it would be perfectly fine. But it's just weird: by all accounts, the real story of this artist would have made for a much better movie, so why did they come up with this boring script? I guess there were not enough naked people in the objective version. In the end, it closed quickly with a summary of the artist's life: we could have saved a couple of hours if they had favored the rest of the film with the same brevity.
