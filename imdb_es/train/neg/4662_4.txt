The writers probably had no experience in the military, and probably never looked at a history book, but I still give this low-priced war film a little credit for taking a look at the role of black soldiers in World War II World. br /> <br /> The action is confusing and incredible, any episode of Combat! It has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York giant Rosie Greer was worth it, I paid for this. The artistic direction is of fifth category: men wear uniforms of the Korean War, and when the United States Army arrived in Germany in 1944, the weather was very bad, it is not sunny as shown here, and I do not think the terrain resembled northern California. . The script never makes it clear why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1, which probably would have received second-class troops. <br /> <br /> This basic idea of ​​history (racist southern officer in command of black troops). ) should have expanded to a big budget production back then, and it's not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this movie for making the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it a while ago and thinking that it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
