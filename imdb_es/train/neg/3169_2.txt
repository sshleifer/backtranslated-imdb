This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has talent, and the only one who is not annoying. I've never seen Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie it was horrible. It's as if she did not know anything about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the movie, and she can not stop being a whore and still be entertained. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and it's like you're looking at the reference cards while you read them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's very original. It goes from point A to point B with little surprise. Much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth seeing.
