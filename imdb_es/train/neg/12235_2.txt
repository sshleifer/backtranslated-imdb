If you want to know what kind of music the whites heard in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you will also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my comments on My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> Indulgent Admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance. Having just seen his predecessor. But as an adopted woman who is preparing to finally find my biological mother, My Girl 2 made me look, with the theme of looking for my mother. <br /> <br /> Put another way, everything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but related to a protagonist who asks, like many adoptees, "who is my mom" ? And if there are my mother's home movies in a company of actors, I'll make sure to make my own film about it. <br /> <br /> People are apathetic. Movies should not be apathetic. My Girl 2 (as My Girl 1) is simply ... apathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are a complete madman who feels comforted by a series of small annoyances.
