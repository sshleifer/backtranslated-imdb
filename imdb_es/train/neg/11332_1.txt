As big as a Texas prairie and equally boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not float this exaggerated pot. Taylor, in fact, SEEMS bad: incorrect dress, wrong hairstyle and incorrect makeup, a unique achievement in his extraordinary career. Hopper offers the only credible performance, and Dean in the climate scene shows remarkable talent as something we do not normally remember him for: a comedic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what, shall we say, Redford could have done with the male protagonist. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the last twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relation to each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, just a collection of cardboard cutouts that appear periodically for no discernible reason as random targets in a shooting gallery. To his credit, the film tackles racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and has SIZE, making it an excellent option to get rid of unwelcome house guests. Those with the DVD version can save some tedium when starting with the second disc. You will not miss anything of interest.
