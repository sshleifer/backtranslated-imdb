My friends and I watched this movie about a week ago and I feel it is absolutely necessary to tell everyone (or at least those who will read this) that this movie is not only among the five worst movies I've seen, but in Reality Has the honor of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but none of them beat her for being stupid. You could say that I suffered seeing it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting a few hours and could not go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks. I do not recommend this to anyone. At first I thought we were watching a very bad porn movie, but after 10 minutes I discovered that it is not like that. It's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just horrible!
