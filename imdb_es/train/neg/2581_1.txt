['First of all, to put aside my own personal feelings, let me start by saying that I hate the so-called comedies in which each of the characters is written and interpreted as a fool so stupid that you feel guilty if all are the result of the inbreeding. <br /><br /> Now I&#39;ll say yes I saw the first three American Pie movies and, while they were not the most incredible movies I had seen, they were fine (and the masterpieces compared to the three &quot;American Pie Presents&quot; movies), I still feel forced to ask what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie? <br /><br /> I also have some other questions too. <br /><br /> Who thought this was an acceptable use of study funds and production resources? <br /><br /> Who approved the final script (and what did that person smoke when they approved it)? <br /><br /> And finally, why did someone think it deserved to be released in cinemas where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars, depending on where you live, when you should have gone directly to the discount box in Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /><br /> There are so many flaws with this movie that I can not write a very complete review of it because it would exceed the maximum words allowed in this forum, so I will only address the most important things that are wrong. <br /><br /> The plot is generic without inspiration and stupid, and the characters are as interesting as seeing the painting dry for eighty minutes, but the most important thing I can see wrong with this movie is the performance. <br /><br /> While the majority of the cast has no talent, there are no names that are likely to be forgotten in a few years, <br /><br /> The only name of this film is Eugene Levy, who spends most of his time on the screen with this smile of complicity on his face that tells the viewer: &quot;I know this is not funny and I am losing my talents. they pay me for that, so who cares &quot;he does not even try to make funny his jokes (he really deserves better than this crap). <br /><br /> As I mentioned earlier, most of the rest of the cast is horrible, although some of them have been in some really cool TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character that is as unbearable as it is unpleasant and irritating. (There are things he could teach tropical skin diseases) that you would almost like to die slowly and painfully on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law and Order) simply hangs on the screen and wastes the talent he has. for being in this movie. <br /><br /> Maybe the next movie in this series is just a soft core porn movie with a story line so you can get around the MPAA and get a R rating. This movie does everything possible with pointless nudity and nonsense sexual content that should Have gotten. Classification X (the classification board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for qualification). <br /><br /> It&#39;s interesting that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven presented A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review, he was forced to cut twenty-five seconds of footage (I think it was part of a death scene that had a casting silicone of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and had no choice but to do so or the film would not have been released, <br /><br /> but this kind of unnecessarily offensive garbage can get the R rating today because everything is done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or a horror movie with this kind of content, there would have been a big stench for the content and Han got the dreaded X rating. <br /><br /> The last thing that really bothers me is writing, this movie is written like the wet dream of a twelve year old boy with an extremely hyperactive sexual imagination, quite youthful and extraordinarily crude, almost all the expository situations that are supposed to change The corpse that This film called a plot is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and the so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes, regardless of often repulsive sexual references and unnecessary and constant deviant scenes. The sexual behavior feels as if this movie had been written by an incompetent first-year pirate in a low-cost school rental script writing class. <br /><br /> The long and the short is your time to kill this series before it becomes more stupid and more offensive, this cake is full of apples.']
