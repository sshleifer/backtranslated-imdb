The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire. The script is weak and has been presented badly. The movie simply does not have life. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off doing a filmed concert for their final pairing. There is nothing wrong with his singing, it is everything else in this turkey that is overcooked.
