Omen IV (1991) was a bad thing for TV. movie. Since the 1980s ended, I suppose executives experimented with methamphetamine (the drug of choice during the 1990s) because there is no other reason to explain this parody. Why did they bother doing this? A t.v. movie? What were you pondering when it appeared on the board of ideas? Did you even think for a second that this movie would be so popular? Maybe they thought I could do it as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have spent a couple of dollars instead of releasing this "extra" record. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically a remake of the first movie of an average American family. Instead of a punk boy brat, we have the spooky girl who is a total brat for everyone around her. If the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that have occurred in the past movies would have ever happened. These parents need to put their feet down and do some true discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, it is best to avoid at all costs.
