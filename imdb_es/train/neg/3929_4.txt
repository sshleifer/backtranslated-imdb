If this is all that the Watchowski have to offer in terms of a background story to the Matrix, then I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe that the movies are meant to register on a deeper level. The second rebirth, although visually stunning and beautiful, is clich√©d and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story that humans rely too much on technology, humans very eager to wage war, humans basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second rebirth, does not that make the machines good? Machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human masters. They fight back, win their freedom and try to establish a peaceful and harmonious coexistence with humans, who reject them in favor of a total war, which the most intelligent machines naturally win. If this is the background story, then we should not be supporting Neo, we should be supporting the machines! Humans were cruel and oppressive, while machines were brave and wanted to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that Watchowski's intention is that we privilege machines over humans, I must believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a mistaken attempt to create a background story.
