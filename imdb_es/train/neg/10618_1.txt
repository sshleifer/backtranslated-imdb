The film is very bad and it is degrading for rape victims. On the surface, it can be a daring film about rape, but if you dig below the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape. Aishwarya, the rape victim, is shown as a helpless victim who can not cope with everyone because she is a WOMAN. She needs a MAN to help her. When society makes comments about her and makes comments, she does not defend herself. Anil Kapoor has everything to talk about while Aishwarya cries. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) took the wrong path in interpreting a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been most effective is to portray a strong woman who rebels against her enemies courageously. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. You need to learn that just because the role is controversial does not mean that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degrading scene in the movie is when Aishwarya "cleans up" herself after being raped. He does it to please his father who thinks he is dirty now. While it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a crude way, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father was wrong in getting his daughter to do something like that. Therefore, we have a confusing message about the violation. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not necessary in a strong theme film like this one. Moreover, comedy is simply not funny. Ash is wooden in his role, while Anil Kapoor just screams. The music is mediocre, except for the title track, which is beautifully represented (the only bright spot in this movie). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and pointless. In general, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being a terrible mix that will give some viewers severe indigestion.
