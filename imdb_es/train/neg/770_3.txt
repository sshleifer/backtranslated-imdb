The strange Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of antiquities collector thief Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, he dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiquities "Spanish Judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his delayed girlfriend who thinks he is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, Jack crosses the collector twice and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The "Spanish judges" of low budget is a film with a reasonable script with a terrible conclusion that wasted a good cast. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save the stupid story. In addition, scenes that are supposed to be fun unfortunately do not work, and are actually silly and not fun. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for money")
