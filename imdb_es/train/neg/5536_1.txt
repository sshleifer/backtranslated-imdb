Revolt of the Zombies has no redeeming characteristics. I am tired of people saying that it is not so bad, and that the effects must have had a greater impact in 1936. I suspect that this is not true: it is not like the IQ has increased considerably in the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored by this crap as today's average viewer. Why? Just try to see the first scenes and count the breaks between the things that happen, the terrible choice of when to close up, the slapdash edition that seems to include two additional seconds in each shot to avoid runtime. Pay attention to the completely redundant dialogue: "I'm going to make some tea / go outside / read my book now". "It's you?" "Yes I am." That type of exchange happens several times. Normally I would love to be a big fan of bad movies, but watch the apathetic actors who murmur their hackneyed and tedious lines, and all the desire to laugh at the movie fades slowly. This kind of wasteful, selfless and boiling pot is much worse than energetic and imaginative mental fanatics like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than those more interesting movies have an idea of ​​upside down entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that its jaw is hung with astonishment: it is bad in the sense that its eyes slowly close in boredom. Which is much worse.
