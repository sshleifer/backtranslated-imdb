a documentary performed / manipulated on one of the darkest places in Guatemala. represented as a fun place, safe ... but sad, where a group of sex workers can play in a football team, gathered in what seems like no more than a week! The main objective of the documentary is to demonstrate that society repels this type of "workers", although a solution for these poor women is never achieved, except that the people who documented this turned them into a kind of "stars" (like the title says it) in exchange for being exploited for making this documentary as a reality. However, it has its own documented reality ... but, unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the main story. I would not accept to see him again; but I would recommend it for general cultural purposes only.
