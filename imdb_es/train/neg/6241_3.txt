Something that really does not go well with Al Gore's theory (and its supporters) is all about "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, why is it that the "believers" in the all-powerful global warming feel the overwhelming need to try to harass anyone who questions them. <br /> <br /> Why is it that anyone who does not dare to deal with global warming comes across cocky accusations of being stupid? or on the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a professional researcher of global warming does not mean that he is on anyone's payroll in that wonderful world ...) Why is it so necessary to tell everyone how the whole question is resolved, When is it the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? To get some ideas on the answer to those questions, read Prey, from the well-known oil puppet Michael Crichton ... oh, wait, he's rich and he's not on the oil company's payroll. He just ran a great professional risk by not following the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshipers and told the truth while investigating it. By the way, did you know that complying with the Kyoto Protocol would not lead to a drop in temperatures, according to its own supporters? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away from so that he would not receive every penny from the environmental lobby should he decide to run again. <br /> <br /> So, who is a puppet ...?
