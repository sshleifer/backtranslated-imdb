HORRIFIC! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this among the 10 worst movies in history. Kindergarten students seem to do special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. ... wait, I've seen programs better than this. It opens like a soft porn program with a naked and fuzzy woman doing a shower scene and then it gets bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that's it. The problems of sound and light were persistent throughout the film. Sometimes I would swear I could hear the roar of the camera's engines. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and team needs more acting classes and film making. Voted 1 out of 10
