I've seen the Gator Bait movies, and this is almost exactly the same as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exerts her revenge against each one of them. What distinguishes this movie from those (although not far away) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is frontal nudity many times throughout the movie, but even for a second it is so sexy. Some of the rape scenes may seem a bit extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need for this woman to seek revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain another interest than to manipulate our natural desire to see this woman take revenge on her attackers. Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of film you expect to convey a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on the female lead, it was not meant to be overlooked. A movie of T & A. <br /> <br /> B movies are famous for being driven by nudity and out of control of adolescent sexuality, and although I Spit On You Grave is unequivocally a B movie and contains more than its nudity part, the Nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the conspiracy is an empty need for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary defectors as they were in the Gator Bait movies, and the biggest challenge for writers seems to have been to find new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why the movie can never be more. A meaningless B movie is because it does not deliver any kind of message, but simply satisfies the public's desire to see a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem this leaves is that we have to face sexual attacks. Interestingly, the first half of the movie is the part that contains most of the nudity (although not much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We were even a little disappointed to see the woman take revenge since a couple of the deaths were so complicated that obviously they were impossible (it seems pure luck that the boy from the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to embrace). the engine in the boat and press his genitals against the propeller, staying like that while the woman screams some final words and pulls the cable), but again, this movie only satisfies the desire for revenge that the first half filled us. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that this is all it means to make the film, since it literally ends at the moment when the last man is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not leave and she never returns to that nightmarish place, she just gets into the boat and the motors around the lake while the movie simply stops. But hey, what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and did you read the slogan? If you decide to waste your time looking at this, try to find any man who breaks or burns. I really was wishing that?
