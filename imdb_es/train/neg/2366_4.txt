I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this one is horrible. Deaths are so fashionable. If you were to see this 20 years later, the whole Nintendo scene is outdated. I liked the flashbacks. I think they should have done a prequel when he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
