I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this film. It is, in a word, boring. Maybe the fact that it is too predictable, the losing role of Ben Stiller or the funny scenes for nothing else exploited make this film something to forget. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's performance. I loved most of his films, the last one I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What's up with the rock school? Ups, frightening.
