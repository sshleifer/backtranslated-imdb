This movie is just a genre of children against evil. Thunderbirds is just the hook for people to see, but its use is almost incidental. The fact that the action takes place in Tracy Island is just a tactic to attract the public. It was interesting to watch what the filmmakers will see about the future of London and how the world fits together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie are some of the lines delivered by Lady Pen√©lope that are very funny. . These provided some relief to those who expected a replay of the television series. <br /> <br /> Having said that, they spend about 90 minutes more or less in a "funny" way and, therefore, it's worth seeing them.
