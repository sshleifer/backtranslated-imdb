AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out his best scenes. In the scenes she is in, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a subplot that is similar to a subplot in "Get Carter", but she handles the subplot better in "Get Carter" (blame the director) The director's homage to Hitchcock was corny. (It is the scene in which the character of Ryan Philippe realizes that he can not trust the character of Tim Robbin, at least I think it is a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows the scenes that were cut. he should have confidence in his instincts and not listen to the test audiences.
