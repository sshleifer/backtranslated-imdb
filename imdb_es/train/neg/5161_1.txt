My life is about saving animals. I volunteer with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal even to sustain my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene in which the children throw stones at the bird until it dies, with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. It just convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending, adopted by the foster parents before their time, does not redeem the description of animal cruelty. Why would someone want their son to watch this movie?
