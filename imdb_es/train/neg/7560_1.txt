An incredibly thin and unattractive plot, characterization / motivation up to the ankle and a really horrible soundtrack (which replaces the tension with vast swathes of noise, replaces the original arcane musical references for shocks and digitized roars. original that are simply "glued" on the cracks ... Terrible ... In a world where the brainik and brainless Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (uncontrollably weeps) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently , this one takes the proverbial cookie.Excitable nonsense.How Ellen Burstyn once got involved is a wonder ... Garbage.
