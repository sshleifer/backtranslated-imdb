When I first saw this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's interpretation of Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball that portrays herself in the way she was in the movie is horrible. I can not believe that all the actresses in the world who could play a Lucy much better, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It is quite difficult to find someone who can look like Lucille Ball, but at least they could find someone a little similar in appearance and talent. If you noticed Lucy's rendition of York in episodes of I Love Lucy as the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar at all: her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To top it off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal, and once again, his performance is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> In general, the casting extremely horrible and the story is badly told. If people want to understand Lucille Ball's real-life situation, I suggest seeing Lucy and Desi's A & E biography, reading Lucille Ball's book, or PBS's American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before laughter" would be a better option. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown instead of nothing.
