I've seen some fucking movies in my life, but this must be among the worst. Definitely, material from the bottom 100 (imo, that's it). <br /> <br /> We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car on a road trip to Reindeer. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not very happy with his sex life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who is desperately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, is not sure if his sperm is okay, so a doctor is checking him. <br /> <br /> Now, I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and she let go after about 20 minutes: 'Oh yeah, she's going to end up pregnant, but her husband can not have No baby'. Spot, since this movie is so predictable. Besides boring. And upset. Without sense. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples left in their big car to Nevada, when they were stopped by two police officers, as they did not stop at a stop sign. The boys meet and finally bribe the two officers with a box of beer. This scene is not only useless and is not important (or even relevant) to the film, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and talking, never going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to throw up thinking about the end. Apparently, Roy is NOT having problems down there, so he IS the father of the child. How many times does that happen in the movies ... try something new? The cheated wife finally forgives her husband and best friend for having the adventure and everyone lives happily ever after. Yuck <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is right at the end, with a couple of pictures of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just keep the camera on for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One would expect more from this cast (although Thornton really tries), but he really can not blame them. Writers, what a shame! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
