I rented the video from "The Piano Teacher" without knowing anything more than what was written in the video box. I did this with some concern because the films that win awards in Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. About a quarter of the way I found myself saying out loud: "This movie is boring." Halfway there he said to me: "Where have I seen this before?" In three quarters I had discovered it. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary origins, this film is essentially a much earlier (1969) version of Robert Altman, and better, "That Cold Day in the Park." Although the details obviously differ and Altman's work was more plot-based and less in character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing "new" to be seen in this production. Every aspect has been done before: a character out of control with an increasingly self-destructive behavior ("Bad Lieutenant" by Abel Ferrara, 1992); a perverse and condemned 'love' that culminates in a scene of operatic death (near) ("M. Butterfly" by David Cronenberg, 1993); unusually brutal sex scenes ("Blue Velvet" by David Lynch, 1986); and so. Therefore, I am baffled by the fact that many thought the film was "shocking", "demolishing", etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made with the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, in large part I attribute such a reaction to the lack of experience to watch movies. Watch enough movies and really, eventually, you've seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated version 'R-rated', I doubt that the additional scenes change my general opinion of "The piano teacher". <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is not without merit. There is a very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. The creditable performance of Isabelle Huppert also helps to avoid wasting time. This is the first of Haneke's films that I have seen, and if I saw more, I hope he has the same opinion of him as of Ferrara: an interesting director but not the genius that others believe. . Score: 4/10.
