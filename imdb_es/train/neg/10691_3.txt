I argued with myself whether to rent this or not. I am always afraid of renting something that I have never heard of (I do not remember that I was in theaters). Great cast ... that's what tilted the scales. In 30 minutes, I almost stopped seeing it. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It only gets worse after that. The writers of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their films even a little better. Or they could just try to write something a little believable. I give it a 3 ... a 1 to write (just because there are words) and a 2 to get so many good actors to accept this movie despite having to read the script. Oh my God, this movie sucks.
