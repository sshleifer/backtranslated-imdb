I've seen and liked the original movie, and I expected more from a remake than this one. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. There are no complaints about the score and the visuals, they are adequate and the performances were correct (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were good and a handful of "supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: The escape from the city of the apes was terrible. The characters go in circles, then, suddenly, somewhere in the center of the city there are tunnels to escape. Also, what escape route leads through everyone's room? <br /> <br /> The story was reduced to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more value and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was completely absurd as it was presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
