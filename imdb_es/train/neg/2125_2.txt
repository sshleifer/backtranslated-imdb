If I had not been forced to see this for work reasons, I would never have exceeded the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit that I went ahead through parts. The film version of 63 was far superior in all aspects. Yes, I read that this book is more faithful to the original work, but it was very smart for the writer to change the script in '63. It is too long, drag, the songs that are in this version and not in the version of the film are boring and unimaginative. The version of "Kids" in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of the sarcastic humor of the parents. In this version, Kim is too old, Conrad is * absolutely horrible * to contemplate (when someone ripped off his shirt, I shrugged in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (can not even keep in tune) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had been like that, his career would have ended before it started. As for the other actors, well, I kept waiting for Alexander's redhead to fall while dancing and Daly was totally over acting as mom. Watch Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the same role played correctly by someone who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing more than a total waste of time for anyone.
