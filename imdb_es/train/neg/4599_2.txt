The proverb "Never judge a book by its cover", was coined as a warning for those who can not look below the surface. <br /> <br /> While watching the artwork, "King of the Ants" I instantly thought HORROR! The arcane images that are proudly displayed on the front and back speak of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and retribution. Instead, what I discovered below that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. <br /> <br /> The "King of the Ants" introduces Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average man ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except that Sean Crawley is someone you do not care about, I never felt sympathy or sympathy for this character. In fact, it is totally unpleasant, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who becomes an uninspired performance as an absolutely worse event because of the absolutely laughable dialogue that he is forced to recite. Include Kari Wuhrer as an afflicted widow who apparently has unconditional trust (especially in the homeless), and little or no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober standard of Cheers, but MEANS! <br /> <br /> Now there are a couple of interesting sequences of "hallucinations" in this movie (the source of the cover images) but this movie never delves into that world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, a bad dialogue and an unlikely event after an unlikely event. Oh the horror!
