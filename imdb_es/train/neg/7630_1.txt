A boring movie about a boring city in the 50s. How can anyone think that this is a classic? The producer practically ended his career by pressuring his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several films that were well above his acting ability. I think this movie gives an idea of ​​how bad future films by Peter Bogdonovitch would be. The career of Cybil Shepard was submerged after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It was not until "Moonlighting" that his career began to return. I thought the performance was a misinterpretation of the, "Graduate." I have noticed that this movie has not been shown in the United States. The only place where I have seen him was abroad in Europe late at night.
