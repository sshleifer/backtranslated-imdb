During filming filmed in a video of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is simple without thinking. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released in a rehabilitation center due to overcrowding in the hospital. She is by far the healthiest resident to observe, while one man puts dead flies in another's soup. Ethel is then annoyed by one of the half-house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits the cost-cutting measure of feeding residents with dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire rope on the stairs and then ... well, you get the idea. If all this sounds funny, it is not. This movie was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when they send their lines that they should be standing in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks from Ethel's first film, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. A very poor effort.
