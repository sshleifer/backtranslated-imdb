Basically I took this film because I had seen the brilliant Zatoichi remake of Kitano Takashi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale that also starred Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and subverted clich√©s of traditional samurai movies. Gojoe deviates in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that have other characters that inform the audience how the main character is, rather than the character developing throughout the film. . "You can not decide if you are a monk or a warrior", says almost all the characters in the presence of Benkei, however, this internal confusion is hardly transmitted within the character itself. Instead of developing character, we get scenes of boring, boring and bloody battles. The character of Asano is not developed and he even seems to be bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know he usually looks aloof and cool, and that's part of Asano's appeal, but this movie does not help him. <br /> <br /> Much of the movement of the camera is nauseating. There is a scene that continues forever in which the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that really good samurai movies are not being made in Japan today with this kind of budget. The colors, the scenery and the costumes were great, but the rest is just a waste of time. I would prefer to see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
