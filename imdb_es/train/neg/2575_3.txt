This really does not match the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not so funny or crazy or hyperactive. The stage and the music have no inspiration and the plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this' one is nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped to spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and prepared the film for some imaginative scenes. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or attractive. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even offer decent entertainment on this occasion. It is as if they were fulfilling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full screen with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including some trailers. But a curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or time code that is displayed on the player once inserted. Although you can still jump to the next scene number with the remote control.
