I ordered this extremely rare and overrated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal fan of horror, from the cheesy Americans of the 80s to the European zombie movies, I said to myself that this would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First, I thought it was going to be much heavier than it really is. After everything I had heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to see it. The murders are boring. The acting ... forget it, there's no acting! The story, even if we do not care, is incredibly bad. It seems that they tried to get your attention with some strange sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case the film does not help. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst of this movie. It's just a bad movie making from point A to point. Although it is extremely fun and fun to watch with your friends and many beers, do not make any effort to put yourself in your hands. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro Files!
