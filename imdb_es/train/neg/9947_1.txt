This movie was horrible. I swear they did not even write a script, they just flipped through it throughout the movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * Phht SPOILERS more as reasons for not seeing it * Sit and have breakfast for 20 minutes. He could have been gone a long time ago. The terrain was difficult, so it would be almost impossible to track it without dogs. And when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault Rifle as a sniper rifle (and then cuts a tree with eight projectiles, it would take thousands of projectiles to cut a tree that size). Shotguns and handguns are considered inaccurate at 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What did the light reflect? I did not see a scope in that thing. Also, when he was shot in the stomach and went ahead, that was delayed and he would bleed to death there. In addition, the end where you put a stone or a cigarette in the barrel of the boys. It would not explode and kill him. The bullet would still shoot and kill Ice T, but it would ruin the cannon.
