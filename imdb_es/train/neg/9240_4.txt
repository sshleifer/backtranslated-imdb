The idea of ​​making a miniseries about the Berlin airlift seemed to me to be one of the most interesting German post-war films. It is a subject that has not yet been explored. However, the creators of this series filled it with clichés. Start with the cover of the DVD of the film, which is a direct copy of the cover of "Pearl Harbor". <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) hears that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war is struggling to survive. She finds a job in the US base, gets to work for the best officer of the highest rank (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love with 'm', gets pregnant and, suddenly, her husband reappears. Come on!!! We have seen this once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their part quite well; Bettina Zimmermann, however, never seems to really convince. For some reason, it always seems that it is too late to give the correct emotional reaction to the scenes. It just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with the airplanes and the aerial lift, sometimes we are exciting, more often not. Unpleasant things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of World War II movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream provides much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
