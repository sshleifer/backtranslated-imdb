You can give JMS and the guys a pass in this case because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still below average. Do not get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best television series in history, but if you were an executive watching this movie, you would not have ordered the series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly and there are a lot of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set fire to the series and it turned into an incredible show. If you're a B5 fan and you have not seen this movie, look at it. If you're not a B5 fan, do not ... you do not want to see the series.
