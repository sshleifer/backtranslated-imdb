First film directed by D.W. Griffith; presents a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the minstrel of the palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to carry out a horrible revenge of type Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear the conspirators against them; although the actors try to appear alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" look very staged. The performances are fine, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
