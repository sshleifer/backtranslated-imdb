I totally agree with another of the critics who was pleased: "For The Birds" won the Oscar in 2002 for "Best animated short film", not this unhealthy material, which in the best of cases is pretentious and attractive to anyone , of course, that has no belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but so are many animated short films. And, by the way, I love dark humor, but this was not attractive from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As for the story here: a boy walking and surrounded by nothing but gray (here's the symbolism). a television (which appears a few hundred meters away) that is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I guess that would be fun in two of the three cases.
