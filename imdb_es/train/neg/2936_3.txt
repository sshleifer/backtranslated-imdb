I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) of this movie, and I was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and I wanted to do three in a row, but it was not like that. I went with a Spanish speaking friend who felt the same. There is not much of a plot, in your case. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but you need to entertain me or bring me somehow. The best I can say is that it aspires to be an altman-esque movie, albeit with an extremely small set. Sure, there are moments, but a few minutes are easily reduced with 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating of this movie. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
