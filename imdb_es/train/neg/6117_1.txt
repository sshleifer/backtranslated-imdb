I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think so because when it premiered in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough for my girlfriend to insist that we see it, and in fact, STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) is still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience started laughing at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie for the rest of the way. Once we got to the infamous (and endless) scene of the snake fight, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give is the exuberant shot to the place. Oh, and so are Bo's breasts, although her performance is so rigid that nudity is not erotic and is not much more than a Playboy image. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this film is between Bo's The terrible performance and the horrible direction of her husband. The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those movies that is bad enough, which is worth seeing on the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I've paid to see.
