This movie is based on the novel by John Fante. Could someone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this good book should be adapted in this way. If you want to do a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how could you make a connection with Ask The Dust (the novel)? And if you wanted to turn this story into a movie, why would you want to turn it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not get it. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is wrong, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you will not like what Towne did with it. . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you might find the strange cast, the bad acting and the cinematography a bit exaggerated. But you expect the best. I really expected a lot during this movie. Actually I wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it's that simple: whether you read the Fantes novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another melodramatic production of romantic Hollywood combined with bad acting, lack of structure and, of course, many shots of Colin Farells naked butt. <br /> <br /> I could complain a lot more about this movie, but why waste my time. I have seen it. All right. I had to see it, because I really liked the book and I was curious. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's sweet little mustache at the end of the movie. So sweet ... If I had used it all the time, I'd given it 2/10.
