Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 dollars to rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the greatest regret in my life. Whoever has thought about this movie, or has financed it, deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they thought when they made this movie. This is an overweight boy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes a pretentious nonsense that tries to pass himself off as poetry. He joins his loving friend on a trip to the coast. Where are the girls and others. Only the fat man does not get a girl. The skin films do not bother me, I take them for nominal value. But this movie is about being more than a skin movie. This is a fat boy who is looking for love in a girl, but then he meets another girl in silicone in a bikini who enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, he gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyway. The dialogue is super horrible even for a film of C. It is compatible with a ton of black stereotypes, without character development, it is a glorified porn movie, without any type of pornography. Never see this movie.
