This is based loosely on the ideas of the original success of the 80s. It is set at present, since we see that a base in Afghanistan is destroyed by a UAV from the beginning. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark. Unmanned aerial vehicles are not armed. They could be, but I do not think it's ever really been tried. We can see the computer that created this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. They introduce us to the "hacker" Will Farmer (he's good at chemistry and electronics, which does not make him a hacker) and his love interest, Annie) and Will's first attempt at piracy is not just a complete failure, but that also your IP address. Registered and Annie guessed who he was. We also met with Wills' mother who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Taking money from your neighbors' bank account (Mr. Massude) is not a hack (it helped you set up the account), then we received a nod to the original movie where you decide not to play the game. Global Thermonuclear War and play the Dead Code. The trail that RIPLEY's office is running is NOT on Will but on Massude's computer, so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY closed Will's machine does not explain (he's just playing an online game?) and also why he felt the need to turn off all the electricity in the whole block where he He lived too. Why an anti-terrorist agency would see this as a viable objective is extremely questionable. As for RIPLEY activating your mobile phone? I think not, I was not connected to the PC and the message was not played unless I actually answered the phone, so there is also more scientific hacking. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at the Massude house, take it and give Will an envelope that contains a lot of money. The search for the registration of the car that took Massude is not a "trick", since you never see it break into the DMV computer. The RIPLEY agents who trap Dennis at the airport while searching for Will have no authority to arrest or arrest him. Will's mother had not "stolen chemicals and biological agents." And even if he did, they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriotic law or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada, since it is a totally different country with laws different from the US. UU <br /> <br /> The computer has run out of control and all the actions it took against Will, his mother and Dennis were not sanctioned by a government agency. The "phone phreak" we see Will doing is the first show of any piracy skill in the movie, we also got a RIPLEY hack that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "kid" who ran into Annie at the airport and also seeing them on the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the laughter that RIPLEY could track a cell phone while he was underground was so Stupid like the idea that a computer reads the lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mention Stephen Falken as the system designer who replaced RIPLEY, the Joshua Project. We discovered that the "boy" who met Annie is Falken (not played by the original actor) who faked his own death. <br /> <br /> We can also see WOPR as "what will help" them. he beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then. Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after they are hardly used (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and the Russian.) It is also unlikely that they will create an autonomous computer system that has the ability to shoot or shoot nuclear weapons. . the country in which it operates. <br /> <br /> The whole plot and the idea of ​​"Decontamination" are totally incredible. Those types of orders would have to go through the President or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Therefore, another laugh and incredible idea. <br /> <br /> The tricks of IP against RIPLEY are not done by Will, he only gets in touch with one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea. It's exceedingly ridiculous that Will would get a login just by increasing RIPLEY's temperature performance. Having Joshua as a back door in RIPLEY (especially after being ripped apart) is an incredible escape and cries from a very desperate writer who had no idea and wanted to end this movie. /> <br /> There is a tremendous good where RIPLE AND is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes), then RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes", how bad is that when you can not even continue with your own timer? The attack mission of RIPLEY against Philadelphia stops (too easy in my opinion) and decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and diverts the missile that goes from Philadelphia to Washington, where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realize what he's doing is not going to work (surely he would already know if Joshua met her since he already learned this lesson in the original movie?) It's another gesture back to the original movie. <br /> <br /> Your explanation for RIPLEY repeating the exact same words of Joshua at the end of the original movie only serves to show how many original ideas you could not find. <br /> <br /> If you want to point out false and stolen ideas, the culprits are Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner. This is a horrible movie and it's better to avoid it.
