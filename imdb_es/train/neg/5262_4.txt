We had to go on a date, so we turned on the DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He denied with his head. I said, "So you made me see the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened." He did not "make" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The body of the movie itself was pretty good. There was a lot of suspense. He kept asking you. Then came the end. The ending was ... well, it's just over. They did not let you in on what happened or why. Right up to the credits, I kept thinking that something would happen to explain it, but it never happened. So I came here waiting for someone to discover it and I just was not paying attention. Not Here, four years later, I am as clueless as Tom sawyer was. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what happened. I'm glad I did not lose any $$ for buying it because I'm sure it would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I get it! The end of the movie is what disappeared! ROFL
