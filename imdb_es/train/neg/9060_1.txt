Navigation through channels and captured this in LOGO. It was one of those moments of "I have to see this because they are terribly bad", like Roadhouse without joy. The writing is atrocious; It is completely inane and the acting is bad in your mouth. <br /> <br /> There is little budget and then there is the abyss, which is where this epic must be launched and never seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in a rented house and the house is, well, ordinary, which is not a big deal, but they choose to show all the guests that they pour out like the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but seeing 6 men look every 10'x10 'boring room with a futon and dripping is scarce. I guess they did not learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see scene from the hotel room) ... wow a toilet! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy everything over, so everything goes routine. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently, other critics closer I think that, since I did not like this movie, I am an "obvious hatred" that I can only assume means that I am phobic, which, of course, is not true . I decided to do this crazy madness and judge the film based on the actual content of the film and not for its mere presence (that is, it is refreshing to see it). <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be refreshing to watch, but that does not amount to a great movie, just give them a better material to work with and a stricter direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalog than see it again.
