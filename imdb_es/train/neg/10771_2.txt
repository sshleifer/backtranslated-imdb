I have not seen children's movies for a few years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (I did not even see "Bad News Bears" even though in the 70s I worked for the guys who financed that movie, "Warriors", "Man Who Would King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show", among others.) Now I like to watch old or small movies and find people who have had a great career despite having participated in a not so good movie from the beginning. Within a few minutes of this movie I could not resist anymore and jumped to the final credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone to bigger and better things: at least, observing his appearance would create some interest. How the plot and the performance were not doing the job. Behold, he spied the name of Wes Craven in the credits as a charge of electricity. He had already made two or three of his first hits, but he had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed him a favor and helped in this photo. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the credits of the cast as "Aesop", a crazy character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, from the 70s until a few years ago, appeared and produced films for adults. It was associated with the adult parody "The Ozporns", and only that title is more fun than all the "Tigers" combined mood attempts. That the fact that an adult actor has been placed in a children's movie is an indication of how the people who make this film must have been asleep at the wheel.
