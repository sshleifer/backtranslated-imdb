I saw this movie that I really did not expect much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way underneath a fiver, so what can I expect? and you know what was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some interesting points (and some are stretching it), the casual view of the camcorder is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to a drummer, that is, damn annoying Well, that's what it's really about, the problem is that it's so boring, in which I can only assume that it was an attempt to create tension, a lot of nothing happens and when it does it's completely tedious (I had my thumb in the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but I tried it) and seriously it's the lead singer of the band that looks fantastic, because they do not half mention how beautiful it is a hell of a lot, I thought it looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I have not even mentioned the killer, I'm not even going to get into it, it just is not worth explaining. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are the only reason to see this and, with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny) it was not because of his talent as an actor, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I have also seen much better. Better avoid it unless you're bored of seeing dry paint.
