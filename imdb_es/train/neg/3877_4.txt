I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first saw it. I do not understand why it has become a "cult classic" when it is so boring. The initial scene looks promising, when the fat nurse drops the blood container and runs for her life. After this, all that really happens is that the melted man lurks around some woods and houses, while he has flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is pretty good, and his sticky face looks quite realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a man's head in a river, and floats until he reaches a waterfall where he falls on rocks and opens. However, there is not much to get wet, most of the scenes are recorded in the dark and you really can not see what is happening. There is not much blood, at least on the Vipco DVD that I saw. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is not so good at all. I'll give you marks for your cheese factor, but that's it. If you want a cult classic of science fiction and TRUE terror, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
