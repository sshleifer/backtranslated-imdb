Do not waste your time on this dreck. As shown, the characters have no redeeming values ​​and watching them interact is pure torture. "Gothic" was entertainment at least, this is crap. If you like to see pretentious and spoiled poets striving to make fun of each other, this may be your thing. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete imbecile, and the reason why others choose to spend more than five minutes with him is really disconcerting. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any kind of spine, but even she comes out of the ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another movie based on the same theme, but I did not capture the title. I expected this to be everything, but there was not so much luck. Not recommended.
