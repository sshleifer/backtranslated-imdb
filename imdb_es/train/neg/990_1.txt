Do not waste your time or your money in this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). So, we decided to see it anyway, thinking that it could not be so bad. Was. I can not believe that this film has been produced and made available to the public. It was so horrible that it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look the other way but you can not do it. Honestly, I feel emotionally marked. It went from being a low budget movie in which a college girl is assaulted by a guy who is dating a porn movie. And it really is not a good one. I went from hating the rapist of the woman to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, a horrible movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your children see it.
