First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the work. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is leaving to do a job for his teachers, why waste almost a third of the film in these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc does not go anywhere, it simply shows us that Hackman is under surveillance and all he says or does is know by the teachers. Again, another 20 minutes. Then he lost more time showing his reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken between 10 and 15 minutes at most simply as a setting for the real action, intrigue and twists of the plot. When the real action started, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as always, and the other actors too, but this is a mistake of the first magnitude.
