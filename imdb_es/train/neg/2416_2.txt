2 stars, and I'm being generous. (minor spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie movie that takes place in Glandland Oakland. According to the plot, a scientist wants to revive his dead brother after being killed in a drive-by. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what zombies?! All the "zombies" do is snarl (which does not sound remotely terrifying) and drip red, fake blood from their mouths! No frightening eyes, no rotten flesh, just a group of people who groan pathetically and run like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also deceptive. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole movie, so it is not as if the whole "hood" was full of zombies or anything, they are only a few, and it is contained in no time. <br /> <br /> Acting in reality It's so bad that it's hilarious. No one can act at all in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems that a group of friends got together, decided to train their family and made a movie a weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: since when do doctors wear tracksuits? Skip this, please!
