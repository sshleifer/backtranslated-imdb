I admit that the problem I have with the famous Ealing films that I have seen so far could be mine. For my taste, either they are black and very funny, or they are so soft in tone to be unsatisfactory as comedies or stories. That is a self-important way of saying that I would like "The man in the white suit", but I found myself struggling to sit down in his short term. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be docile, but he is stubbornly committed to making progress in the form of his attempts to invent a fabric cord that can not be broken or fouled. Using a factory laboratory for his last experiment, he strives against both material and human limitations, the latter being the chiefs of mills who do not understand what he is doing, then resolve it and commit themselves even more to stopping it. <br /> <br /> "It's little minds like yours that get in the way of progress," Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what she struggles to tell Man. <br /> <br /> One problem with "Man In The White Suit" is that the vision of Sidney's progress is also very small, even more than that of bosses or workers who also resent their work. My problem is more elementary: for a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny. It's a pretty serious script that too often tries to undermine his weak attempts at humor to spit, double shots, triple shots and dizziness. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney is busy doing it, going "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" incessantly and getting rare looks from all the visitors until Sidney extracts his miracle or he exploits it trying. Like any other kind of lost humor that works decently in this movie, it leans too much. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness less affected in a movie, even though he looks incredibly young and serious (though Actually, in his mid-30s). He seems so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general who played in "Doctor Zhivago." It is the same cold fish if it ignores the sad affections of the girl from the mill who offers to give her the savings of her life when she loses her job. (Pan-faced Vida Hope as Bertha) or the more sensual amulets of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), her only real ally in her fight against "dishevelment and filth", as she says, making those words sound so Incredibly sexy as only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Support players make the "White Suit" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger of "Bride Of Frankenstein", fame, plays a singularly nasty industry captain who looks like Nosferatu and makes us laugh like a death rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford, as another factory leader, is as memorable here as when he played with a medical officer in "Lawrence Of Arabia." Then there is the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a girl who steals her few moments in everyone else's camera. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are reproduced so directly that one would not think that director Alexander Mackendrick had worked in a comedy (his previous Ealing comedy, "Whiskey Galore" does not reverse that impression, Unfortunately). The work of Roger MacDougall posits the notion of scientific progress as a potential disaster, but does not present Sidney bored with anything other than the softest and most pleasant of lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. However, the Ealings I've seen never seem to do this, working only when they aggressively play against our own sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, imagine) are classics in this way. "White suit," on the other hand, is a meaningless ride that falls apart when it should be joined, just like that unfortunate suit.
