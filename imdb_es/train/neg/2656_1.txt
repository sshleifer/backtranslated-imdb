(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Normally, a Diane Keaton fan, I tried to see this tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour because I found myself without any sympathy for the daughter or the mother. Both seemed absorbed in themselves with little regard for each other, and the daughter was also rude, disrespectful and unwise to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was: "At least we will not have to keep an eye on her". Keaton did a good job of moving to his stunned state and to the duel, but by then it was too far away for me. I just was not enjoying it, so I stopped looking. If you want me to worry about the protagonist, you need me to worry about the characters much earlier, if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The support The cast was sincere and well-interpreted, I felt for * them! *, and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that was not enough to bring the movie to me.
