The first scenes move as smoothly as the frozen velveeta. The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me want to have better control of fast-forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy, clever, or cunning creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. Usually, I count a count of bodies, so there was a cat (who does not count) a vagabond, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (whatever it is) and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting an apple for a vampire to bite a victim is simply silly. I liked Warlock, but this movie just sucked so bad that we turned it off, and it was so easy to forget that we rented it a year later just to turn it off again.
