Yes, in fact, it could have been a good movie. A triangle of love (sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes rare, sometimes it is fine, the image is crowded and narrow. The sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), the filters of light and color are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About acting ... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others act immature and can not convince the viewer. The performance is poetic when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetic. It is an image for adults, told by children. Disturb only if it is extremely curious.
