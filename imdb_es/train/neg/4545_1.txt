This delicious combination of New Age babbling and outrageously bad film production may not "open" you, borrow one of the movie's favorite verbs, but it may leave your mouth open and your stomach aching from laughter or arching. Based on James Redfield's bestselling book, the first (self) published in 1993, this kitsch cornucopia traces the spiritual awakening of a US history professor (Matthew Settle) who, traveling to Peru deeper, darker and phonetic , either Air or something more illegal. That is, what he discovers is a disheveled Shangri La populated by smiling zombies that can be crazy or just medicated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a flowering of the flute and an occasional cry of a celestial choir. Although much is said about "energy", that quality is definitely absent in the diverse cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly established in the pantheon of the camp. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the shout of a script. In short, easily the worst movie seen in more than 40 years of watching movies.
