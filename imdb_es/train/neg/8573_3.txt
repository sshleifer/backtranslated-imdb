I do not really like the Sean Penn address, and this first job, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no nucleus, is colored with a kind of pallor, authoritative, which in all honesty contaminates most of Penn's work, his latest work even more than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seems to produce a fundamentally banal product, apparently in some loyalty to honesty, but ending up, for the most part, glorified and moralistic professional wrestling matches, almost as if the Hallmark cards would have developed a line of greetings from the Hell's Angels and made me wish the days of Deliverance, which is a good movie. Viggo Mortensen's performance is much, much more credible here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's it. The film does not make sense, and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, rather than a story. However, congratulations to Charles Bronson, who shows that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's character. A terrible 3 out of 10 for this shit from The Indian Runner.
