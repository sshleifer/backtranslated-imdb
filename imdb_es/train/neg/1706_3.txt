Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as you read in other comments, this movie has no plot or character development, possibly had some kind of script, but it is difficult to say depending on the actual final result. <br /> <The editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to help the viewer determine what is really happening. <br /> <br /> Everything in all this is just a low budget zombie movie that was not thought at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, everything is bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this must be the place where they spent the money they had to try to justify this. <br /> <br /> Unless you're (like me) dedicated to finding and seeing all the zombie movies you can find, do not look at this one. Period.
