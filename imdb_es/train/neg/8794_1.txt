I am completely disconcerted as to why this movie is even liked, let alone held in such high esteem, especially by so many critics who, otherwise, are quite sensible. <br /> <br /> There is a keyword that describes this. The film in its essence: irritating. <br /> <br /> The easiest example to explain is the use made by the director, or, more precisely, the abuse of music. In the first half, a really boring reggae tune is played about three times (when once it's too frequent). But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, usually at maximum volume. For God's sake, whether you liked the song in advance or not, you would be completely fed up with it in the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they have listened to California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary repetition (which does not contribute to the story) could be justified if the rest of The movie had some persistent merit, or if History involved in some way. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect that I found sympathetic was that Bridgette Lin was loading. and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this disappeared quite quickly. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the great undeserved reputation of this film will convince many poor fools to come and see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you, if you have never seen an HK movie, do not start with it. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to see it, avoid at all costs to see it in a cinema. The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> They have warned you!
