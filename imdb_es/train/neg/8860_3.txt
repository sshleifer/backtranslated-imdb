OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a bloody film of sexual exploitation that had a large amount of material removed (or obscured to near invisibility) to escape the censor's X rating; but the movie also has many other flaws. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the writer seems to have confused his werewolves and vampires. The bad guys in this movie are hairy and do not like silver, but in all other aspects they behave like vampires. Now you can not just do that with a shit genre movie, you have to follow the rules of the genre or the fans get confused and upset by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole plot (confused and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires, but it makes no sense in a werewolf movie. have you ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf movie business should know that werewolf costumes and transformations are something critics critically evaluate, however, some of these werewolves are simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of slightly good parts. Actually I really liked the score. Others have mentioned the tits of Sybil Danning. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also quite liked the plan to attack the strength of the werewolves. There are so many horror movies that they trust that the characters behave stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensitive and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and kill the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have quite powerful firearms these days. It should not be too hard to put two and two together, huh? But in the typical style, this film goes further and adds other fun and funny anti-lycan weapons.
