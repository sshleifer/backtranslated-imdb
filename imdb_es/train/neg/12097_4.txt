I really did not expect much when I went to see this. After Mst3king, to JasonX's devil with some friends, I expected a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie took itself too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? Sorry no. There is a legion of Ft13th movies that cover that anyway. At the end of the day, he is a serial killer not dead, I just will not have that sympathy. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not. , but unfortunately they were few and far between and at the end of the film, it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity death fighting ... but not fun. <br /> <br />
