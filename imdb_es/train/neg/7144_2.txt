It was almost worth sitting through all this horrible "movie" just to know that I could never experience something as bad as this again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male protagonist - 0 (eight mile cheddar bob as a gentle war hero who takes the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is beautiful and is not a terrible actress). This is the criterion that I used to average it in two. I lost the account but I think that I've ever clich√©d movies, ever, it's in this movie. When the driver who supposedly killed his father miraculously appears at the end to compete against her, from nothing he cemented the previous statement. In addition, he simply appears for no reason. It was never mentioned before. I do not know what else to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple of years. At least that way, part of it will be edited for commercials.
