As a child, I remember seeing this while visiting a friend of our "uncle" Phil. We're back! The story of a dinosaur is a caricature of a dinosaur named Rex (with the voice of the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a small dinosaur story about how the dinosaurs returned to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. The villain doctor / teacher of this movie I think could have been responsible for their return, but I do not care about him. Kids may like this, but personally it's too corny. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
