A copy of this happened. Not mine and if I had spent my own money on this, I would be finding those responsible and demanding it back! All I can say is that this would be a terrible student movie. Any understanding of the medium of the film is absent. Acting is a scary god, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in the tone of the main character's reaction to the "ghost" is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "brilliant" critiques of this film are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even entertaining bad. <br /> <br /> Extreme amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
