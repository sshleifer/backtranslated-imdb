I understand jokes pretty well, they just are not good. The show is horrible. I understand, and that's another horrible thing about that. The only great character that was NEVER in the program was that vagabond in that episode, but then I see the other episode that includes that episode and the program is horrible. It's not funny, NOT funny! I do not want people to say "Only intelligent people understand it" because if they are so intelligent, why do they judge people they do not even know and say they are not intelligent or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "Heaven is red", but never look out. But anyway, this is absolutely the worst show I've seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're horrible, their controversy is very scanty, their jokes about farts and other jokes about everything Fluids They are really stupid and generally consist of a really bad performance. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this program, but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not exactly a smart comment.
