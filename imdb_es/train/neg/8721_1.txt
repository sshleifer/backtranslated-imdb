I'm sorry, but this is just pathetic. The girl was a brat, they were not nice characters and the plot stunk. Also, it was not even an alligator like the movie would like us to create. If you check a complete reptile guide, you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a crocodile. Obviously, they did not hire a true animal expert or they would know that the creature is a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
