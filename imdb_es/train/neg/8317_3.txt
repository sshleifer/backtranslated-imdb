For a movie about a murderer, this is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> It does not happen much, and even when things happen, they do not generate any enthusiasm or real interest. <br /> <br /> The performance is good of the two prospects, Cassetti in particular offers a great performance combining the certainty and the stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the cast also does what it needs. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is bad writing and direction and the fact that as a real story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> Films of this type usually try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret for having wasted time looking at it.
