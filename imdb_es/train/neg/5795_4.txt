"Lies" talks about an affair between an 18-year-old student with an ox-tooth and a 38-year-old married man, scrawny, with the pair of protags who spend roughly half the time on the screen dedicated to naked sex and whipping and the other half snaking through the pathetically naive. A story that seems little more than an excuse for sex scenes. With a very poor production value, which includes obvious sanitary wares and soft fake sex in a story that is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes redundant until the end. With a career of almost 2 hours, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (DO-)
