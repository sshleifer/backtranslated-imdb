What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well, I saw it on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and since that flight was long and boring, the film definitely did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost completely unpleasant even with his redemption at the end. The run time of more than two hours of the movie wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that simply chains the frame as slow as possible. In the defense of cinema, the character of Rosario Dawson gives a little life to the film, although not much. I do not understand how someone could really cry during this movie, when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Will Smith also kills himself with a jellyfish at the end, which shows that killing himself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
