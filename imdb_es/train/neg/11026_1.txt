I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was horribly inaccurate. It is as if they had a list of names and everything was invented. Their thefts and escapes were well planned, until the second: when the time was up, they left, they had all the money or not. They had notes of all roads, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him in the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis did not even see Dillinger before the night they killed Dillinger, just pictures of him. The way in which the members of his gang died was fictitious. Dillinger never stole a bank alone, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The performance was a little exaggerated in some places. The action was exaggerated too. On second thought, I doubt I would have enjoyed it very much even if I had not read the book.
