Almost all the details of the plot in this film are illogical and implausible. It does not look like a genuine human story, dead and boring. It is a parody of Hollywood, with trumpet fragments reminiscent of a Denzel Washington movie, shaky footage and focus, racist stereotypes, utterly unnecessary and comic shots and gestures of famous people in poses of clothing catalogs. It is made to cater to the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from seeing celebrity names. The only good things about the film are the final credits and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot to see this, save yourself.
