Seriously, what were you thinking? Over the years, the Columbo series has tried some new things and deviated from the usual formula of success, but this movie really exceeds it. This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie, but the differences are not for the good of the movie. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that No murder is being committed. The whole premise of this film is totally different and places the character of Columbo in a totally different environment and situation. In addition, the set is totally different and more 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi did some other Columbo movies in the past, which adhered very much to the usual formula. It also makes it a strange choice that he was chosen to direct this film. <br /> <br /> Columbo's own character also feels quite different, perhaps due to the reason why he is placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps his nephew after his girlfriend disappeared just after the wedding. The absence of a good mood of Columbo and relief does not make this a good or nice watch. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the movie does not start so badly, but the movie starts to become more And more ridiculed with its story as it progresses. It's a stupid kidnapping thriller written with a story that is becoming increasingly unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more indecipherable. This is a very small ticket from Columbo that does not know how to entertain the spectators either. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that the supporting actors are not the most talented. . Despite the fact that his character is in a totally different situation and the film is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still holds some of this film. Can you imagine what this movie would have been like without him? It would have been a very bad and ridiculous movie. I can say you. <br /> <br /> A strange entry from Columbo, which could be described as a failed experiment to deviate from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
