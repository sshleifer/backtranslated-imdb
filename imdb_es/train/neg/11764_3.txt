I must say that I really looked forward to seeing this movie and finding a new life in it that would separate it from the most boring and overly elaborate Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted that Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas would be the one that would inject freshness and confidence into our nonexistent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I heard before watching the movie) sounded different from the others, perhaps because it dared to include new faces (apart from Demian Bichir, which is always one of the favorites of Mexican film directors ) and supposedly were treated within his script with modern social behavior, perhaps because the picture I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic rather than theatrical. The film turned out to be a great attraction for the public and a big disappointment. What Serrano is really about here is the very old "battle of the sexes" since "all men are equal" and "why is it that all women ..." blah, blah, blah. There is nothing new in him, not even that, he uses so much common ground and cliché that he eventually mocks himself without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / male condition. Filled with the usual vagabonds in the audience as safe jokes about the clichés I talked about before (always work, always) and screaming performances (it's a well-acted movie in its context) ... and by shouting I mean, literally. The most convincing characters at the beginning played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be, according to Serrano, the most pathetic. I totally disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated that way just to serve as puppets for his lesson to come ... he made sure we received HIS message and completely destroyed their roles, which were the only solid foundation in the that this story could have stood up. Anyway, after all, it's a very entertaining movie and you'll probably have a good time (if you agree to be manipulated by her).
