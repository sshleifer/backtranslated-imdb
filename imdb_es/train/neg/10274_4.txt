In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the pirate radio American Nightmare for fun and confess their most intimate fears. A serial killer, who listens to his confessions, makes his nightmares come true, killing each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange low budget movie that has a horrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13. Then, the story changes to a bar , where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment, the story has great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, also showing some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as is usual in this type of production of C. However, the end of the script does not provide any explanation for the killer instinct and the reasons for the behavior of nurse Jane Toppan, giving the impression that the budget ended before the end of the shooting. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low budget slasher movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agon√≠a")
