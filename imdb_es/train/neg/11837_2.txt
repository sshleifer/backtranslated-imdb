Can anyone make good CGI movies besides Pixar? I mean really, the animation seemed outdated by the standards of 2006 and even by the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever his reasoning, the story really stunk. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat, a rat that pulls on a toilet. Yes, I know, it seems stereotyped. But then the sewer imitated the roads of London, to a certain extent. Add a promise of jewelry (????) and an evil frog (??) and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something that entertained me. Maybe the connection in the movie? Or maybe the happy rat relationship forever. But nothing did. He had the talent, but it exploded. RE-
