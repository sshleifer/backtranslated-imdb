The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face movie. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is not funny and Mike Myers could not have been worse. This is the worst movie he's been in. The acting and the story were terrible. I mean, how could they make the stories most loved by Dr. Seuss become a movie and one of the worst movies of all time and such a big disappointment? I could not have seen a movie worse than this one, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how bad this movie was. Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's perspective: 0/10 No stars F
