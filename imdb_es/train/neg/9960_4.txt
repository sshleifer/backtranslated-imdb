MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> After an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a reliable The neighbor, the young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) is related to a strange child (Ben Whishaw) who knows in the forest. Unfortunately, Whishaw has its own secrets, no less disturbing and much more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dour drama, caused by the brave performances of Harrison and Whishaw, in which two like-minded spirits immerse themselves in a love mutual nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship unravels as the harsh reality begins to intrude, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the film looks irregular in many places (too many uncomfortable close-ups and careless manual camera movements) and it takes a while to find your feet, but the dramatic benefit is discreetly gratifying.
