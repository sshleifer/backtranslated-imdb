Normally I am disappointed with network movies. Even flixes that attract well-known actors are often ruined by television people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The script is weak and the performance, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I have gone to see the works of my children's high school and I have been tried to act better. Pollan acts as if he were reading the script while speaking. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it is extremely empty. Due to the general quality of the production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to face this one, prepare yourself for a big disappointment. The things that scare you will not scare you, the sad things will not make you feel sad, the romance will not make you feel lukewarm and confused and you will probably be as anxious as I am to see the end come. "First to die" says a lot about this movie.
