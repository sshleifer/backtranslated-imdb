Now, please, do not start calling me names like "unpatriotic", "weirdos" and more. <br /> <br /> The maximum duration of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. There is no edition at all, it seems that J.P. Dutta fell in love too much with her project. Even Lagaan lasted 4 hours, but it was entertaining and he also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people. Congratulations, but were the repetitive war scenes really necessary? In addition, the focus was constantly changing from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep track of them all. <br /> <br /> Among the skirmishes, there were songs about loneliness, the evil of love and related things. There were chummy conversations. At first it gave some relief to the violence, but then it became so monotonous that one could even correctly predict the nature of the next talk. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk like lions in the jungle? Did not you know that the enemy was lurking somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it provoked sympathy, but in the first place it seemed to distrust them for their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was melodious and the lyrics were touching but they did not fit the film. It's better to listen to them on the soundtrack instead of in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was salvation: from experienced veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relative novices like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, they all acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening the mood when necessary. <br /> <br /> The dialogues ranged from brilliant ("De Madhuri .. with Love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada Musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And the large amount of words that consist of all the MCs, BCs, Cs and F-words was not really required. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to provide an adequate tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but he tries too hard and eventually fails. The Indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute.
