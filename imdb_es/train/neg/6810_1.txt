To be honest, I did not like the "Executive Decision", which was obvious the template, a lot, but compared to this garbage, it seems a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only that the people who move in the movie (the term actors would be an insult to all the other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who builds the stage has not even seen an airplane from afar. It's so ridiculous that in a 747 there are only 3 flight attendants on board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogical (for example: use gas to sleep, then do not use it, then use it anyway), which finally lowered my rating to the bottom. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun rearranging the sock drawer or piercing a hole in the knee and filling it with milk.
