This film was supposed to represent the bachelor of a "Ladie's man" who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not care that his mission was established, because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, no charisma. There should at least be a way about himself that made women weak in the knees, apart from playing the saxophone, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love with within five minutes of knowing that she was absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame that ever? If he had ordered, and stopped doing and saying stupid things, he would have been more attractive as a character, but, unfortunately, his character was insipid and boring. <br /> <br /> The character of Gina Gershon was unnecessarily British. She could have been as easily a stranger out of town with her regular speaking voice as making a poor British accent that would sometimes fade through the movie. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cared for were the fish and the frog. Now those two had chemistry! Nominations to the academy for both ?? STAT! Synopsis, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a movie disaster.
