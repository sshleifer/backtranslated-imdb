Although it's an R-rated movie, I really doubt you really enjoy it unless you're a teenager. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, there is no character development, there are no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has a lot about is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked girls (some pretty ones I could add) to delight you with your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why this movie has the title of American Pie, since it's just bad news. combination between an erotic film and a comedy without being successful in being any of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked girls, but you are too shy to rent them. buy an erotic movie <br /> <br /> Gave 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for the good girls
