Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a policeman, which is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he is in love with a car (a very bad one) and is found by a doctor. The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he begins unconsciously to behave savagely and becomes the best policeman one could be. For the moment, he realizes the changes and his animal instincts begin to take over his human side. Meanwhile, find a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means you have to control yourself and behave in a civilized way. I'm not a great fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is the first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See his role in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny actually). There are some good parts in the movie, like his flirting with the goat. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I am sure that this movie can be seen as long as it is not taken seriously. But very sad to watch movies like those that go very well at the box office. The Animal is not the worst movie I've seen to date, but it does not get more than *.
