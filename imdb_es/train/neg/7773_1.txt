['This movie had what seemed like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really useless like the dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at the woman&#39;s body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are funny in their horror. What is really strange is that towards the end of the film it becomes a 5 minute western, and in the end, the turns, of which there were several, do not make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed that the director had only added things because he thought it would look good, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the film until that moment. It just did not make much sense. The only scary thing were the old people who danced down the hall, but that does not even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.']
