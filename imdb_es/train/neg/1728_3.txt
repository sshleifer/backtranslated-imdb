**** Do not read this review if you want the amazing conclusion of "The Monster of Crater Lake" to be a total surprise **** <br /> <br /> A claymation plesiosaur arises from the depths of Crater Lake to wreak havoc on a group of local farmers, not to mention its fast-forward button. Calling "The Crater Lake Monster" amateur is exaggerating the obvious. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you probably would not be looking here in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that when there is no monster action going on, it really stinks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in the sense that it is fully designed in the way it configures the main action sequences. Nothing is too extravagant for "The Crater Lake Monster." He explains his dinosaur by hitting a meteorite on Crater Lake, "overheating" the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have been there for so long and have remained uncovered and viable, would the "overheating" of the water at such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate? Apart from some fog signals in one or two scenes, we see no evidence that the water is hot, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty obviously filled in some sequences, and it will do whatever it takes for the characters to get close to the lake, so that they can be threatened by the claymation dino. A couple who just happened to experience problems with the car and, while the car is serviced, they decide to rent a boat and go to Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think these strangers in the story could be there to meet our monstrosity title? In a sequence that is simply strange, a drunk steals a liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and the viewer instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of alcohol. Follow a car chase, and you would not know ... they end right next to the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it is not difficult to decipher it, and you are so far ahead of the script that you get irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. <br /> <br /> The shame of all this is Enchanting, and I really want you to like "The Crater Lake Monster." I just can not do it. There's not enough here to continue, and this is more of a movie to put on during a party, because you could talk directly about it and it would not matter. <br /> <br /> The movie has a slender list of things in its favor, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head that crawls from wood through the water, and a fully realized claimation insert that looks pretty good. There are also a couple of adorable hicks on it, and they carry most of the intentional humor in the movie. An uncomfortable ending makes us regret the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks, so all the good things about this movie are dead at the end. Why did this conclusion affect me so much? Was the sad song played in the final credits? Or was I just crying inwardly for the time I wasted watching movies like this?
