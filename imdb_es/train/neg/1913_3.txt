"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Taking into account the people involved, it should have been several times better. <br /> <br /> When you see it, if you are at least somewhat attached to the faith that it will improve, it will probably make you cry. It's one of those films that had potential, but this potential was stolen thanks to a terrible script and a bit of bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary character of George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but who cares So little that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of the film is the strange vocabulary it presents. I found myself thinking about that again and again while watching more crime capers. This is the only reason why I gave the film a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and highly unpleasant. They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they are all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles. They shout and swear maliciously. The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points. <br /> <br /> I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes, if someone really remembers this shit long enough to worry.
