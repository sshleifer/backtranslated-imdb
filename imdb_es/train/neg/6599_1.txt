Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Virtually any movie I've been in is better. Now, old George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie ... but he once said something describing that movie to a T. <br /> <br /> I do not remember his exact words, but he basically said that great Writing can save bad deeds, but a great performance CAN NOT save bad writings. This little observation has never been more true than in "The new adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> The launch of the two tracks was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look at the parts, but they do an exceptionally good job imitating the real deal (mannerisms and everything). This film should be a lasting testament of his talents. That said, this movie falls flat on the head when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING. <br /> <br /> Apart from the initial dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "character") and a brief gag involving a taxi, this movie is an absolute chore to sit on. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie (or, at least, their substitutes). Too much time was devoted to the screen to explain the plot or to the secondary characters that were not very funny and that the plot revolved around it. <br /> <br /> However, even if this movie had been a joke, it would still be. us with ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call "diluted" slapstick. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "aguadas"? <br /> <br /> In slapstick, a character is hurt in an exaggerated way by comic effect (wing Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or what about Laurel and Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the "diluted" slapstick (as I define it), a character is slightly injured or has problems, and the filmmakers interpret it as a comic effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe an illustration would help: <br /> <br /> At Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. Your account is dropped and replaced. That is the classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Ollie accidentally bumps into some people. They turn around, they tell him to be careful and they continue on their happy path. That is not slapstick. That is not even funny. That's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of this kind of jokes. It's as if they were the bread and butter of this movie. Writers and directors simply take these boring moments and act as if they were supposedly fun. Of course, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only leave it a lot. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: the movie just does not work because the script does not take advantage of the pinchot and Sartain's skills to pass himself off as Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes the exhibition of the plot and the boring jokes. Seeing this movie is basically seeing two excellent imitators who were not given real material to work with. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's an incredible help to sleep. <br /> <br /> I say this Do not get lost and continue with the real deal (as long as you stay away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
