My favorite part was when the credits started rolling. I wish I could give you .0000000000001 out of every 10. I really wish I had that hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or time on it. I really could have seen the grass grow and feel better after the halls. <br /> <br /> Nadia was very pretty and I hope the movie did not destroy her career. But she chose to participate in it. <br /> <br /> In general, it was more crap than any other movie I've ever sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That is saying something. <br /> <br /> No <br /> <br /> ¡¡<br /> <br /> it !!!!
