Most of the adaptations of the books are bad, but this film omitted key parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They rewired the plot and the combined scenes and changed the order. They added ridiculous things that never happened in the book and would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book in advance, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, you did not care about the characters, they like them or dislike them. Turn the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> It's horrible. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of two hours of my life.
