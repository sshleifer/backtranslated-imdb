If someone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of World War I, not the history of World War II. Find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around corpses all the time. How many soldiers went crazy, from what they saw during World War I, at the time they called it "bombed", they now call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of the First World War, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can be rendered insensitive to death, not because of their evil, but simply because it was the only way for them to also cope with the horrors that surrounded them. <br /> <br /> so many others do it. Read some books on the subject and you should see the movie "Paths of Glory", the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the feeling of helplessness and a total devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet hunters. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie is missing, it's really the key. Point to understand Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, without any real reason. Then there is an absolute economic collapse, after the war. These are the factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty will always create extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and has become another piece of trash to throw to the pile. Without real value, there are fictional movies based on fictional characters that could give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than this one. They simply launched the name of Hitler so that it would sell more.
