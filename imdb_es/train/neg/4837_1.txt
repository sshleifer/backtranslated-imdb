I went to see this movie just to see what the whole hype is all about, and I felt so disappointed as I was surprised by the way he got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 in the IMDb rating today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director to win the best film and the best direction for this really bad type of movie and I wonder why. Did the story of the "cowboy" bomb disposal man, totally unrealistic, mean something to someone I could not see? Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of a bad old western movie about a cowboy doing "brave actions" in the Wild Wild West infected with the "evil" Red Indians; But only that it was established in a different fund this time? Were you given the Oscars because the director was the former James Cameron, and turned it into an interesting story (gossip) for the daytime TV shows to eat? Or was it a kind of Emperor's Clothing syndrome, where most people realized it was garbage, but could not say it because others did not seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what was that? That sniper scene in which they showed that the casing of the shell fell into a super-slow high-resolution camera to transmit a "deep message" or something? Something along the lines of 'The EOD guys are good snipers all of a sudden and they're going to catch the dirty terrorists all the time'? Was it me who felt there were so many parts and pieces here and there in the film compressed for no apparent reason? And can you get the Oscars to edit and direct them? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they put it on TV in a few years. You will not miss much.
