I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the childhood star of the 80s of drug abuse that is now dry, is insipid as ever, and comments on the back up of minor characters / actors would be useless; Needless to say, they were all very normal. It's a great movie as a trip down the road of memories to the 80s - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado background and a very harmless but dazed plot. <br /> <br /> In general, do not see it. Do not waste your time watching this unless you like 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like me, I love old school Porsches (this one looks great) because life is too short to watch movies shit.
