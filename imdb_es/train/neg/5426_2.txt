In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try `a shameless scam not only of those two films, but also of 'The Evil Dead' and 'The Shining'. That said, they do not really make horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame, because it's a gas. <br /> <br /> Rainbow Harvest is Winona's replacement here, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and, on occasion, shout: "YOU ARE VERY HAPPY!" in her enchanted mirror), she is goth before she is fashionable, so she must respect her (and she is also very creative about it, complementing herself with black leather scarves and a kind of Hawaiian-Punch-guy hat painted with black spray paint. heart, Cher). <br /> <br /> Karen Black outnumbers her, but she is not totally without dignity, and you can not help sympathizing with her (unless you're a certain friend of mine, who asked: " Who is that, "Lips of horse from" MASH "? The first time it appeared on the screen.) <br /> <br /> There are decent support performances by Kristin Dattilo (like the square girl who befriends Rainbow ), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his characteristic hunk role), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (as some kind of entrepreneur of pets, or something like that). But it is sad to see Yvonne DeCarlo, once steaming, reduced to playing what can only be considered as part of Charlotte Rae. <br /> <br /> The eighties were the heyday of hilarious and mind-boggling horror movies like this one. 'Mirror, Mirror' was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth checking out.
