In this era of incredible movie special effects, this was a painful disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerns are not so common in Hollywood these days, but films like "Silverado" show that someone still knows how to make a good one. Considering that, it is difficult to conceive that someone can spend at any expense to launch, let alone create a film as weak as this one. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!
