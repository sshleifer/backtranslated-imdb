Just looking at the scenarios, the staging and editing, it is easy to say that this project lacks an adequate budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is destined to stop thinking about things like that. Young brides fall dead on the altar after saying "I do". Their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist, Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his monstrous henchmen, since his old wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young ... forever beautiful. An anxious local reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid on the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be more informed. A typical horror movie is looming and makes the visit to Lorenz's farm a little scary; Especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
