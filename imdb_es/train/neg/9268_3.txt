*** SPOILERS *** As the combination of double game Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance, we have in "Omen IV" the evil seed of the late Antichrist Damien Thorn who returned. Terrorizing her parents, her classmates, her neighbors and, finally, the whole world as she was called Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being handed over to a "deserving" couple from Yorks Karen & Gene, Fay Grant & Michael Woods, by the St. Francis orphanage of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Little Delia did not waste time making her peasants feel like scratching her mother at a house party. Later, Delia almost dies in a runaway truck just so she can save herself with this "Devil Dog" named Ryder. When going to school, Delia takes care of the local bully causing the big man to get wet in front of all his companions. Later, when his father threatens the Yorks with a lawsuit, they cut off his head in a self-induced traffic accident! Delia is someone you never get into if you know what is good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalia's father, Gene, becomes a big man in the city on his own, or so he believes, by being elected to Congress as a champion of clean air and the green trees crowd instead of letting the smog and concrete guys take over the neighborhood with their eyes now on the White House! Did your abrupt and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden good fortune? <br /> <br /> It's only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny, that the truth is revealed about her strange and evil powers. Jo, a New Age guy, realizes that Delia is a little weird, after making all her white crystals go black, and the flame Guru Noah of the New Age, Jim Byrnes, to visit her and review it. Noah is so annoyed by what he sees in the color vibrations of Delia Kirilian, all black and blue with a little red, that drives him away so much that he nearly crashed into Delia's mother's car. <br /> <br /> Taken on a trip to a psychic festival by Jo Delia, the whole event becomes a hell that establishes the place, through mental telepathy, setting fire and pulling all those who run to hide , including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with a broken leg. The trembling and battered Guru was so moved by the whole experience that he later left the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> Jo herself is expelled later, with the help of the sweet and tender pet of the family, Ryder, from the window of the second floor until her death because she knew and talked too much. When Karen becomes pregnant again, she finally decides to discover the truth about Delia's true parents. That's when she, and we in the audience, come face to face with the truth. She is not only the feared AntiChrist of the Revelations, she is her twin sister! His own brother, the Antichrist, is about to appear as his younger brother until the birth of Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times were more than enough for the Antichrist to return to earth to achieve Armageddon. The movie that was made public was already getting a little tired of him and his bad adventures. With a fourth it really is not necessary, since Daimen Thorn, the original antichrist, had been dead and buried for years. They passed the usual bell without anyone believing that little Delia is "Thee" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race. The film is as bad as it is too long, 97 minutes, for a horror movie that could have said that its history is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Have a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael The apprentice, and later a former Catholic nun, Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now healer Felichy in the film to be killed did not help the plot either. It only prolonged the suffering of those who watched the movie. You could see the end of the surprise almost as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began with the bases that were cleared for the eventual control of Delia from the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a surprise was that Delia did it with a little help from friends.
