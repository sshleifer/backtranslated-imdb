Well, I rented this movie thanks to the director ... he has made some interesting movies in the past (if you have not seen Waxork, you're missing out on a fun trip). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to absorb it and take a look. It is bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and you do not mind that the spoilers keep reading. First, the old saying "You can not judge a book by its cover" applies here. The picture for this movie seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with reflections. The back of the box has a great picture of the red leather Jill and some others. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. You start to see it and suddenly you discover that the movie takes place (in an inexplicable way) in 1977. Jill is a total bitch who is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not as predictable as you think ... and that's not a good thing. The characters do so many stupid things without a minimum of motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie, Dolph and another lady have sex without a good reason. Besides, what was the point of Dolph killing this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him? Anthony Hickox, the director, should have seen a stinker when he read the script. If it had established itself in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters almost intelligent, it could have been decent. Putting it in the 70's does not make sense and has nothing to do with history. Avoid it!
