This movie is probably the worst I've seen. Bad acting, bad script, all bad. It is interesting to compare it mainly with two other films of the same genre and at about the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more robust both in history and in direction, and even so it is Albert Pyun who has directed these two too! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) lives on human blood and that's where the story goes ... The cyborgs need many humans to comply with the "prophecy" and the humans need someone to stop them. A girl along with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been designated by destiny to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director discusses some stylish fighting scenes from Hong Kong with the participants. flying high and jumping away. The film fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people will get a new "worse" movie to relate to. And the fans of the genre I recommend "Cyborg", because I think it's a very underestimated movie with a pretty entertaining factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme, check out "Nemesis." <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
