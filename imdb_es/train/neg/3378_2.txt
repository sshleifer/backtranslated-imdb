By the time this film was released, I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating with great enthusiasm the production of a story film that was so widely rumored. My wife and I were online hours before the box office opened on the day of the movie premiere. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First, the story "moved outside," so to speak, by including scenes that are not in the confines of the theater. These boundaries are a big part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs was eliminated, with a very dynamic dance number; A song was added that was NOT in the theatrical production. What what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the artists. Now I have seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and I would not mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is beautifully written, with wonderful music and truly moving stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a great audition of "cattle called", I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, look at it on stage.
