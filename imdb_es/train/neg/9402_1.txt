Why was this movie made? Even taking into account the generous tax concessions that were granted to Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film to be approved. For the love of God, the actors chosen in this film are Aussie b-grade celebrities (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the band's original drummer on Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the Countdown vocalist. By saying this, this is still very visible whenever you give it the brain attention it deserves: none.The script is bad (even for a self-confessed b-grade horror) and the quality of the acting and the movies is worse. It often seems like it's a home movie, but even a home movie has "realism." Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for God's sake, pretend that this movie was NEVER made.
