After seeing the poster of the film Smother, I knew that I was about to experience one of those intolerable film experiences that make me want to take my eyes off. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought. I was going to rescue the movie. Unfortunately that did not happen. Mother is a horrible movie, but it is not execrable. That's the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> The Smother script (written by the same types of License to Wed, which explains that they have everything but the talent to write movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I did not laugh once watching this movie. Also, the solid cast that I mentioned earlier is absolutely wasted. After the large amount of trash in which she has been involved (such as the monumentally heinous and execrable because I said so), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is dying out. However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances. She has brought in previous decades, in films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom. In Smother, she does her best with her performance, but her character is so horribly written that she can not do anything with that. Dax Shepard has left a good impression on me with her solid performances in the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White also makes a good effort, but it does not go too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown in films like The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I would have liked to see that he was one of the writers of this film, instead of just acting on it. Lif Tyler suffers the same situation from all the actors mentioned above: it is wasted. <br /> <br /> The worst failure of Smother is to be absolutely boring and not funny. His script is nothing more than a collection of scenes and forced situations that we have seen in comedies. Stay away from this fucking comedy.
