Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now, with this mix of great talent, you would think that this movie would have been a true gore fest. This could not be further from that. Massacre falls directly on his face as one of the most boring slasher movies I've seen come out of Italian cinema. Actually, I was struggling to stay awake during the movie and I've never had that problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with a prostitute who is killed on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulci's nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and it increases your expectations of the movie like an ax wielding a killing. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is SO boring. The film continues with a series of horror films that are being filmed and there is a great development of characters during all these scenes, but the characters in the film are so boring and badly acted that their interest begins to filter. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad, but they could have been much better. The gore in the movie was pathetic and, as Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a good turn, but there was still much left unanswered and the continuity falls through the floor. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for a true Italian horror fan (like me) this movie is a must as it is very rare. 4/10 stars
