I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully charming historical piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This film was confusing in most places, choppy in almost all places and terrible at all points. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young scholar was, at best, depressing. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely continue playing Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter films are more entertaining than what they call a work in a movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography seems that a university student took a class of Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost all the scenes in the film are cut by some kind of effect; The final result, of course, is the most cheesy editing edition I've seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; Too bad I had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling does her best as the almost gullible lady in waiting. In the end, I really wish that Blockbuster Video has given refunds. I'm so glad I did not spend 10 dollars watching this fiasco in the theater. If you have been doing this work of Marivaux since the eighteenth century, I wonder how many people over the centuries have had their best naps during this work. If he had been there, they would not have heard the play about snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip the boring or horrible scenes. I guess that means I only saw the beginning and the end!
