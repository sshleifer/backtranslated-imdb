It is very sad. Although this was filmed with a movie, I think it stinks a little more than movies like Blood Lake, There There There Out There &. The music they play in this is the most fun I've heard. I like brother and sister in this movie. They do not try very hard to sound sarcastic when they say things like "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, what about the killer who only wears his mask at the beginning? That is delayed! I practically ignored the second half of this. My favorite part of this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the ax. The exact same sound for each cut!
