It is supposed to be a comedy, but above all in bad taste, and nothing remotely to cause a smile in the movie. The film is about a couple trying to have a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will shudder at the representations that are represented. For example, the scenes in a fertility clinic are not at all funny and frankly embarrassing. The male protagonist who plays a construction worker and his helmet is presented as a bad excuse for the rejection of Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than her. Both derivations are unattractive, unattractive and unconvincing. There are several ridiculous and totally simple free scenes in the film, for example, with an economical airline, which lacks humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a brand for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class superior to anything else in the photo, and a brand for some decent music (albeit old) .
