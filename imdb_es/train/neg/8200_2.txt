This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. There were a couple of subplots that for a time made you think that all the elements would come together at the end ... but they did not. If you want a story of "extraterrestrial in the frozen garbage," stick with the 1950 version of THE THING (not the abomination that was remade in gore-o-vision 20+ years later). <br /> <br /> I could not. Do not forget the fact that the "alien" seemed recycled from the DAY OF INDEPENDENCE. <br /> <br /> The "minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could act and take the desired mood. <br /> <br /> Many landscapes chew with little reward.
