But this movie was boring. The history part was fine, but the musical part was not. I did not care about a song or a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus was supposed to "be a comedic relief, it would never work." If John Adams was supposed to be the nasty annoying, the rest of them tried to defeat him in every scene. <br /> <br / > Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their history.The context was interesting enough, but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. <br /> <br /> Should not you be humming the songs after a musical, except for a few squeaks, nothing else was worth it?
