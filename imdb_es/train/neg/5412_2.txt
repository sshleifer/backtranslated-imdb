Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst movies ever made by mankind. The film, one of the many films for the disabled that emerged after the phenomenal success of Black, is a mockery of the fraternity for the disabled. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere cartoons of disabled people. While Black portrayed the shock and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two monkeys who seem desperate and who have no qualms about being disabled and attacking half of the world to protect their interests loving The music of Anu Malik is quite fair. Vivek Oberoi, who had a promising start with Saathiya, is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be excluded from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are simply damsels in distress who have nightmare moments in Thialnd with no one to save them, except the desperados mentioned above. Boman Irani, like the villain Don Toni, is something acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
