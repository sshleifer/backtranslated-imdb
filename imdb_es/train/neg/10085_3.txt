Why do all Lifetime movies have such anemic titles? "An unexpected love" - ​​ooh, how provocative! "A lot I know" would have been better. The movie is nothing special. Real people do not really talk like these characters do and situations are really trite. The heterosexual woman who "becomes" lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character. If you want to see two hot women kissing in a very discreet way, you can enjoy this. Although it seems that it was written by someone who does not really go out into the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
