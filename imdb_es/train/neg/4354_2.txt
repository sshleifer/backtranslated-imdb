This show is horrible. No comedy, no plot, no good characters. America is blind, gives the prize to the real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. Honestly, I'm so glad you canceled this show. thanks CBS. keep two and a half men, keep Christine, keep the rules of engagement, keep how I meet your mother, which is not really funny, but it's much more fun than this. This show is a scam of friends. with the same director and that's fine. But keep this show out and never give it back. never ever ever The only reason I did not give him a grade of 1 is because he keeps me awake instead of asleep. Those are the types of movies or TV shows that I give to one. the only reason he was still awake was because of the audience's laughter and he looked forward to the next show. I really want this show to be funny I'm sorry but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I do not see why everyone loves him. My opinion again. But I also find the Big Bang theory a bit stupid. my bad intelligent The farewell of the class now I have a smile and it is not to see your program.
