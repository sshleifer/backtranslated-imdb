The Van is a good movie about a boy who tries to attract girls to his new van to seduce them. The only thing in which this film does not fail is precisely the fashion description of the van in the United States in the late 70's. It seems that it was done entirely by amateurs. It's garbage, but I loved it! I have to admit that I am a fan of the garbage of the 70's! I hope this one reaches the bottom of IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
