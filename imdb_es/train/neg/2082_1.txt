What a waste of time and money! My husband and I watched this movie, after seeing the previews and thinking "it could be fun". INCORRECT! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are caught in a badly written script and can not get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's nude can redeem any part of this movie. The special effects ..... are not. I half expected to see the harness and cables that held Uma in her flight scenes. And when the effects of the people apparently could not control the flight of the bullets faster than those of a superhero or the scenes of struggle, they covered everything with a whirlwind of blurry screens, which hid the terrible effects quite well. Wilson's partner was an excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office coworker. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not fun. I guess I expected too much from these actors. None of the characters was really understanding, so I ended up not caring about any of them. The only memorable performances were the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl in their teens, at least THEY had some chemistry. In general, a super stinko movie, I would not even recommend it as a rental, it would be a waste of money!
