I really enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything related to it (budget, script, argument, casting and acting) was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, does not look anything like an Indian, nor half of the other "Indians", who were played by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the boss acted more like a fat old man than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did an excellent job in the original, seems to be moving forward this time. I guess he could not resist the easy payment he received for playing his role as Horse again. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horse having undergone a painful purification ritual to "find his vision" and gather the Yellow Hands against his white enemies and oppressors. , but in general, the Return is uneven, boring, cheesy and predictable, like most of the sequels.
