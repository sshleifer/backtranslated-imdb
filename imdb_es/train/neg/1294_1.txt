The central theme in this film seems to be confusion, since relationships, the environment, the performance and the social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element, and lacks his impeccable clarity, direction and usual intensity. To make matters worse, the name of his character is 'Che', and only the narrator tells us (directly, in the movie) that he is not 'that' Che, only a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided, the younger generation goes to America. So I clich√©. Other reviews discuss how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a child's family; however, the director's political stance is murky at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by the profits of the game), so what? Refusing to take a political position, making a film about the Cuban revolution, is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if the most important thing is to look at family life here, it would be great if we could discover who is who: at first we 'introduce' ourselves to everyone. An economical way to clarify relationships throughout the movie! The performance was mostly superficial, wooden and incredible, time was out of place. The 'special' visual effects were confused and distracted. The references to American films, and the black character as a Greek choir, are strictly gratuitous, intellectually ostentatious and out of place. I only saw the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity, or some point for everything. Never happened.
