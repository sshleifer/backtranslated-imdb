This is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first of all TOOO long. The longest movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The stories are too damn at the top. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are too many stories that history The line is in ruins. <br /> <br /> Comedy was not comedy !!!!! it was not funny ... <br /> <br /> the story is so repulsive and so badly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations of this movie ......... but my expectations were completely broken in the first minutes ... <br /> <br /> the only good thing about this movie is the MUSIC ... ... and obviously Vidya Balan. She gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors ... she is a newcomer and, nevertheless, shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic! Govinda and the blonde who plays her love interest also help to save this disastrous movie. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of the taxi driver. and the blonde also offers a very subtle and constant performance ... <br /> <br /> another talented actress, Ayesha Takiya, is completely wasted in this movie. so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his role well but it seemed too exaggerated !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> the only one that is not wasted is Salman because he has no Talent, what is never wasted !!!!!!!! ! <br /> <br /> In short, all this is a very impossible movie with the script of Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar in which the plot is configured according to the stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it lasts four hours !! Think and rethink before going to the cinemas !!!!! better avoid it !!!!!
