Be careful: neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role as the poster would. In fact, their roles are minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, without anyone being really attractive. Especially I find it impossible to gather much sympathy for the main character, not to mention his fanatical friends and his fianc√© obsessed with sex. The plot drags terribly, and I turned it off after about 2/3, something unusual for me, since I like to finish what I start. The good performance and the beautiful surroundings take it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
