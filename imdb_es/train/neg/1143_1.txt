Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I've ever seen. The Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, shoot their machine guns unpleasantly noisy with wild abandon, and then leave silently. Wow, how will we find those silent invisible killers? Just follow the shell caps and smoke! Dialog painfully bad (or was it brilliant and simply mistranslated?), Not an Asian in sight in the cast, and a total of 3 Asians in the crew. The plot is ridiculous, the performance practically non-existent, then, again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself, avoid looking at all costs!
