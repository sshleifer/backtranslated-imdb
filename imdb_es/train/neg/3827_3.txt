Stereotyped, derived, unoriginal and boring western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give presentations that are far from being the best, and rightly so; both have superficial roles and character traits expressed mainly by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world as he used to be before" and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt." Also, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding and Coburn is bad and tough, but not as cold-blooded as some of the minor villains. Apparently, the filmmakers could not even think of AN original idea on how to make this film a bit distinguished. (* 1/2)
