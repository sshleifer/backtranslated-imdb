It's certainly not horrible, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about the apartheid of South Africa and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious and naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg that says he must come immediately; Later he discovers that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a fighter for the rights of blacks, was killed by the son of Kumalo. In this they connect. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 movie of the same name, because I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical entitled Lost in the Stars, because I have not seen it either; Both look better than this. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I've seen; It has a much more urgent air, as it is really trying to say something where the Cry movie, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film with the novel (except that I enjoyed the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and movies are two very different mediums and it makes no sense to try to directly transfer one to the other or compare them through of the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie exploded. Well, I guess it was not that bad, - Five out of ten, - but it was not that good either. Both leaders, both very capable actors extract some of the most wooden performances I've seen with some of the most uncomfortable dialogues in film history (but that can be attributed to their screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely out of the game) . this movie, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things, the point and the themes of the novel are almost completely lost in their transition to cinema for the third time; There is little tension, if any, with any moment of the film, racial or in suspense. Music does not help. The painfully misguided and openly pastoral orchestral tracks really help with this boredom of the film. A positive aspect is cinematography, with many shots quite good or great, but unfortunately, this does not help much to the film. <br /> <br /> The last and striking words of Alan Paton's novel are shown in the last moments of the film. It's a shame that they seem to be so disconnected from the movie that was just seen. I do not know what Nelson Mandela could have seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
