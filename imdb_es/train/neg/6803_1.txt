When I enter the IMDb boards, I am always fed up when I see a publication of "the worst movie in history". After watching this * movie *, I think I will soon create my own publication! <br /> <br /> The initial titles: great, some kind of zoom lens in a gas oven (yes, focus on the fire = explosions = great action-packed movie!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think Ice T is a great rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes") but Steven Seagal as the policeman who plays is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast is ... well, I do not know where they hired those actors, but yes! I bet my dog ​​would have been a much better actor than them !! <br /> <br /> The argument: Hijacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> The action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I said to myself, well, great! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics .. I was very wrong. The rest of the movie is full of low-rent photos taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are fun, the music is pure shit, the ending is happy (I mean in the end I I was happy because the movie was over !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted (I'm 22 years old, she's 42 ... good). I was about to take the film and record it. Maybe next time I'll see her ... (who said never?)
