What can I say about this movie other than "I do not see it"? I waited and waited and waited for something to happen (or something) and it just did not come. Watch amazingly when two people walk around while setting the record for most of the filler screen time in a single movie. What are they doing? Are you solving a mystery? Are they gathering clues? Possibly, it is difficult to say. At the end of the movie, after many radio signals are decoded (illegibly on some kind of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and thrown aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to return to the utopia of their home world and they are so happy there that they want to fly the earth (I guess they do not like to share the wealth). I guess they finished filming and they saw their work or art of 35 minutes (garbage!) And they decided that they would let the editing team turn it into an 88 minute feature film. Look at your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
