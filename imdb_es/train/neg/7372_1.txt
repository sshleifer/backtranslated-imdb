I am so confused. I have been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all his movies and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "strange". Steven Seagal shares writing scripts and producing credits in this film, but I find it hard to believe that he would choose to double his own voice for many of his lines, with a thin and plaintive impostor voice. What I do not understand either is that if they had to bend SOME of their lines, why does their own voice appear in the rest of them? I hope Seagal will age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this film barely exudes a fraction of the same arrogance, confidence, courage, charm and sexual attractiveness that he so easily showed us in ALL his previous films. What I missed most was her arrogant attitude, sure of herself and her mocking mockery that so easily transforms into that adorable smile. Where is that attitude and charm in your face that made him a great star? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has allowed us to offer. If so, your lifelong fanatics will have to recognize that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone.
