Filmed in a documentary style, but it can be said that the participants were trained. A filmmaker aspiring to divorce recently (Myles Berkowitz) sees the opportunity to animate his love life and enter the film business at the same time. He intends to make a documentary piece on how to find love by filming twenty quotes that include ramifications. The comedy is irregular at best; the rest is one setback after another. Also participating are Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the attractive Elisabeth Wagner. Trying to get credibility, going to look for Tia Carrere becomes a cameo. This will suffice as a manual on how NOT to get a satisfactory date.
