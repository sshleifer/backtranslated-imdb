Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all your work. He has known himself to save movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film has a low budget and its production values ​​are worrisome. Please ... for the love of Christopher ... Avoid this movie!
