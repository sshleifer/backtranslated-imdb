The film begins in 1840, Japan, in which a man kills his wife and his lover and commits suicide. It's a bloody and very bloody sequence. Then jump to the present ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), his wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little boy move to Japan for their husband's work. A house is rented and - surprise! Surprise: it's the house where the murders were committed! The three dead are around like ghosts (makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, but it's really useless. There is a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens between the two. There is a giant crab attack that is a fuss! They look so fake - I swear I saw the ropes pulling one - and they're muttering! There is a nonsensical sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. The scene of the fight between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Albert was fine as a husband and McClure was very good as a friend of the family. But George, as always, is fantastic in a terrible movie. She gives this film a much-needed boost, but she can not save it. I give her a 2 just for her and the bloody opening and closing. Apart from that, this is a very boring movie.
