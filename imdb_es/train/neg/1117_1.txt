I do not know what this movie is about, really. It's like the project of an art school for students. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness, except for a few seconds a day. There are long and interrupted shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. The little dialogue that is in the film is as foolish and absurd as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she gets pregnant overnight and then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a naked white woman emerges. I have never been so impressed by how bad and useless a movie can be. Honestly, I'd like someone to see it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I do not wish this level of hell to anyone else.
