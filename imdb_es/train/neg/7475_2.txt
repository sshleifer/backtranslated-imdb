To be honest, I knew what to expect before watching this movie, and I must say that it has the worst performance I've seen in my life. It has its moments, and on a comedy level it's very entertaining, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity takes it to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary blood, and the plot is all over the place. I have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (I mean who would go there anyway), but at the time I did not care, because I had fun in costumes. , and the bad CGI. As for the B movies, this deserves the title of "being so bad, it's good", and congratulations to the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. For a long time these films can continue ...
