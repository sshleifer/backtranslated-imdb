What a terrible movie. He sucked. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from a critic with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I sigh ... It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's this awful movie. Well really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics? What is another thing, the CGI pulled it out loud; I hate this movie terribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Borman B-Movie, and probably also the most gay B-Movie. It's-is --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerds right now. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
