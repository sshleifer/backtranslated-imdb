This movie is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those movies that show kids on a rainy day at school when you can not go out for recess and you'd rather be watching something, ANYTHING. At least that's what it was like when I was in elementary school. I remember that I hated this movie. Of course, I have not seen it in more or less 15 years, and probably no longer use it on rainy days, but I just want to warn you all: it would be better to use this to sleep your children than to entertain them. they. Trust me, choose anything else. Although the subject is a bit controversial, the plot is so docile and slow that I can not remember anything about it, except that it upset me so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn everyone against it. .
