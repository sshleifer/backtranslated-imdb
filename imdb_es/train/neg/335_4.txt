Michael Jackson would have claimed a place for the first-rate character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves children. That did not work out (and why should I do it?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas." I strongly recommend to all future writers to thoroughly study the insane dialogue of the actor in this extravagant fantasy - adventure - comedy that is one step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does may like him better, but do not get me wrong with his exquisite comedic talent; He does not belong to this movie, and the same was for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and the combined visual elements are reasons to call it a cult camp classic, and that would not make any sense since the fans of Hollywood and the movies continued to take advantage of the boy. Speaking of images, they were surprisingly good at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is much better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this old movie is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste.
