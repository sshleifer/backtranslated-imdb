We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white child, and the cute little child. And we have a careless maid, what program has a maid like that had? Do we have a messy Brady Bunch? Hurrah! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, especially since I was young. The music was bad. The blows were so bad and they were too qualified. All your rap are about your family and friends and problems. The father was a kind of father type "Danny from Full House". He always gave the advice. But he was not a clean madman. They had a housewife for that. Remember? The plots were basically that Lil 'Romeo was in some kind of trouble, or ... it's not that. Oh and maybe some pre-teen drama. Yes that is good. Not really. But it's still a good show for children. But Nikelodean could do better.
