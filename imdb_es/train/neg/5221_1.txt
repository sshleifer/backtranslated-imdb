Hi, I'm from Denmark and one day I was having a movie night with my friends. One brought this movie with him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely horrible. After seeing less than half a minute, we decided to move forward only by stopping at some ridiculous "highlights" or should I say "low lights" in the movie. Actually, I was very surprised to discover that this film was produced here in my country, Denmark ... that must have been the biggest mistake that this country has made.
