Well, this is perhaps the worst movie, at least the worst movie I've seen. They have tried these 666 daughters of Satan, the movies against Christ, about 1000 times, and none of them is good, and this is perhaps the worst of them. They think it's going to be a better movie as more they use that fake blood. This movie has no idea, the actors and the filming are just terrible. I can not even distinguish that minimum of 10 lines from this movie. There's really nothing to tell, but that's just horrible. How can they make films like that in their right mind, they just can not understand that. This can not be a Hollywood movie, right? Just do not go and see how he uses your money more wisely.
