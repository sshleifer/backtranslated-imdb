When HEY ARNOLD! First it aired in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then they started showing the same episodes again and again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching them. I was a little surprised when I heard HEY ARNOLD. THE MOVIE, as it does not seem to be as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, having nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. When I entered the theater, I did not expect much. I was hoping it was a silly version of a cartoon for kids like the movie RECESS. I guess I got what I expected. It was a movie of foolish children and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie stunk. Simply for children.
