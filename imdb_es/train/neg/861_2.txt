A disappointing movie <br /> <br /> History established our protagonist as Chrissy, a "young man", a rather slovenly, adrift individual, who does not do much. Actually, she does very little to move the narrative, so I was not surprised to see how the focus changes in her family. However, it's a shame that Chrissy seems like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and, at times, it felt pretty formulated. So the question now is: when are we going to see Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori breaking ground with compelling and cinematic stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the cost of two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting shooting movie.
