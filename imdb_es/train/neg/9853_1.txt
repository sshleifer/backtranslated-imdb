I think that most people want to believe that there are extraordinary things and this movie does not show any restriction when trying to exploit that to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, it is well presented and the graphics are cutting edge, but from a scientific point of view it just does not work. Flying bladders full of hydrogen? They would have to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the ever present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to pass it off as a fact. Some people will always understand badly. In general, the film is entertaining, but I constantly found myself saying "oh brother, what a load of ...". If you want a FAKE documentary, look at This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at least turn off the sound.
