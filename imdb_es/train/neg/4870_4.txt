The movie is bad Nothing special, just a movie for "children" without anything serious. However, there is a reason to observe this: the animal speaks. Some of them are so funny in what they say, that you can not stop laughing. So if you want to listen to a dog in the dog's dog saying "I'm Keyser Soze," or another animal saying "You're a dead cat walking," or many other fun linings, look at it. Because there is not another good movie to watch it. Voting: 4 out of 10
