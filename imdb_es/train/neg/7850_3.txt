The new version of Alexandre Aja from The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. Not only was it a new version of a classic horror movie, but it was also very good. Then, almost a year later, we are receiving the sequel to that remake. While original screenwriter Wes Craven is back as a producer and co-writer, this film fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military practitioners stop in the desert to see some scientists and find themselves in conflict with the mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain plus some new ones). There is a lot of blood to have here. What bothers me about this movie is the absolute lack of characterization. The viewer does not care what happens to any of these people because we have not gotten into them. Even the mutants had some characterization the last time and this time, nothing. Gore for Gore's sake makes no sense. There has to be a reason for this to happen to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what about the rape scenes in the movies lately? Here we have another without any real reason. Hopefully this is a set of hills that will not be visited again.
