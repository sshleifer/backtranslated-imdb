If you made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book, do not abandon the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and I am almost done with book 10. I dare to say that the movie is a piece of garbage that does not make the series not even a trace of justice. While "Left Behind: the movie" only vaguely follows the story of "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not even accurate. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is about to be informed of the disappearances); Buck Williams is a writer of blonde hair magazines, not a television reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and many of the details of Rayford's book wonder if he "survived"; Buck and Chloe do not meet until much later, at a meeting in New York, established by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," but in Rayford's retrospective thoughts; the roads are so full of remains after the ecstasy that Rayford and Hattie have to return by helicopter to the suburbs ... etc, etc, etc ... <br /> <br /> And that is only from the first movie; They are about to release the third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give the series of books a try.
