And so, the great rewriting of the story continues in the style of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This was ridiculous and pointless nonsense. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that you can spend such an incredible amount of money to produce what it is. The most inaccurate and inaccurate film I've ever seen in my life. It's scary <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's brief flirtation with serious acting seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a flaw in a litany of dreadful movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was not a coincidence, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on those guts. <br /> <br /> Only recommended for those who are recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that the United States invented the world.
