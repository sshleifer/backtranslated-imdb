You know you're in trouble watching a comedy, when the only fun parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a pity that the parrot, the cat and the dog just supported and not the other way around, since the humans in it were quite abysmal in everything. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva. Lake (what kind of name is that), Jason, and Lindsay, I would forget this act of fuss and do something else, since you are all as funny as watching the actors painted dry and horrible paint. <br /> <br /> The main gag of the movie is one of the characters that scream, I'm not Gay, which is fun as if you were not, you could change your mind if you had to endure the three bossy, tedious and I dare say. The simplest woman leads the movie. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years, and I hope I'll never see one again as bad, although I hope not.
