Good. So in reality there are not so many great movies around. Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are usually not so close together. But boy (!) This film counteracts quality. <br /> <br /> I have NO idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers of this world so easily convinced to finance a large number of scams? I can only see it now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, he's cute as a button and he was pretty good at Shakespeare in love, and we have Rhys Ifans, who is not cute, but it was great in Notting Hill, we will mix a really mediocre score, some forgettable post-britpop tunes, hemlock roots and lizard brains and well, you have the worst movie of the new millennium. And believe me, it will be a difficult job to do something so bad like this in the next thousand years. " <br /> <br /> The Bank - "I like it, unnecessary sex, bad camera movements, and what about the worst accents on this side of Devil's Own?" <br /> <br /> Producer - "Yes, we have many of those." <br /> <br /> The Bank - "Sounds great, where do we sign?" <br /> <br /> Please.
