I observed the pilot and noticed more than some similarities between 3 pounds and House, M.D .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept outside choice, similar to the character of Laurie House, but without the sharp wit that Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, the "heterosexual man" of Tucci, the emphatic Dr. Seger, has not become a more interesting character, as the fallible "heterosexual men", Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varma's character, Adrienne Holland, is too similar to Dr. Cameron from Jennifer Morrison to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Someone on CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD and told his staff to get him a similar show, hoping that the mimic would be successful. However, copying a show like House requires the same high-level balance of wit and suspense, and Tucci and company are not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the program was canceled until I read the comments on IMDb, but I'm not surprised.
