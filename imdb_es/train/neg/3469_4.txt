['While filming an 80s horror movie called &#39;Hot Blooded&#39;, the director is brutally murdered and the protagonist is marked while surviving the attack and manages to kill a murderer. After all this, the production is abandoned and the stock rolls are left to accumulate dust. So a group of filmmakers decided to continue where the film stayed despite the fact that people warned them to stay away from the film, since the last person who was interested in the film was found dead in the cinema while watching the movie. From this it is labeled as a cursed production. By not taking these warnings seriously, the team goes ahead with the production and gets the original star of the film back from Hollywood to repeat his role, but not as a daughter but as a mother. But once again, the murders begin to occur when the cast and crew are killed by an unknown figure disguised as a movie killer. <br /><br /> Look what &#39;Scream&#39; started! Hey, I enjoy those movies, but mostly everything that followed was annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage, the subgenre returned with revenge, but it was not good, since most of them were unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts, where they followed the pattern derived from the Scream franchise. &quot;Cut&quot;, which is an independent Australian version of the slasher genre of textbooks, is garbage that basically lacks everything and shamelessly discards any other slasher movie. But you know what, I thought it was a cheesy delight. Yes, he&#39;s horrified and it&#39;s very easy to forget, but it&#39;s a bit of good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I hated it when I found it originally, but the second time I knew what I was getting into and it worked better for that. It was like helping me make a good slice of cheesecake again, but this time it was not so sweet. <br /><br /> The film came out almost at the same time as &#39;Scream 3&#39; and &#39;Urban Legends: The Final Cut&#39;, and all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. &#39;Scream 3&#39; is obviously the strongest of the three, but I would really see this garbage in Urban Legends: The Final Cut. However, it looked more like a throwback to the slashers of the 80s than that of one of Scream&#39;s bastard sons. Enough to the film is given a grade treatment and that is shown in the script and the performances. The dialogue is really unimaginative and has almost no surprises or suspense. Meanwhile, the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the washing actress who comes back to finish the damn movie and I had a lot of fun with her ridiculously ridiculous performance. She provides the snack here and nails it perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian television stars (ie, if you&#39;re Australian) with a dazzling Jessica Napier who heads the cast with characters like Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also the pop singer (and supposed actress) Kylie Minogue makes an appearance in the opening only to be hacked! Beautiful. These adolescents mostly followed the formula of horny and foolish children who have nothing better to do but be killed. Sometimes it feels like they wait in line, because they do not have a real substance to be there. <br /><br /> The plot begins quite interestingly, then heads to a phase of mystery where the false clues appear, but then makes a sudden turn in which it becomes a satire of the horror genre. It&#39;s just pretty choppy and when it comes to the explanation of all this madness, I kept thinking ... oh, my God. This when he tries to turn on himself in an intelligent way, but unfortunately he falls on the road. But you do not love an opening finale. It also has some references to pop culture and a self-referential, ironic approach. Predictability opens up pretty early and jokes can sometimes be exaggerated, but he knows it by mocking himself a little. The environment loses a little advantage because humor eliminates the desolation, but even so, the large isolated mansion where it is being filmed has some details that add a little fear. The movie scene is pretty good too. <br /><br /> Now, we know we want to gore and nudity when we watch this kind of movie, but unfortunately you can not find nudity and the blood is pretty standard, if it&#39;s missing, but it&#39;s more than decent for a movie with such a low budget. There are one or two creative deaths, but the rest are systematic. The killer was not bad, but when he said it hurt a little, I thought, and the smart attitude did not sit well with me. Other production notes that were terrible were from the cut-out edition, the misplaced soundtrack and the direction of Kimble Rendall lacked execution and were pretty sloppy, but these contributing factors come together to add some pure entertainment to all this evil. <br /><br /> The imagination matches the budget, that&#39;s for sure, but what the hell was not trying to be something else. Pure stupid that is a bit funny!']
