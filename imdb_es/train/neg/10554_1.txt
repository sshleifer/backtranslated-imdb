A nightmare of Avent-Garde, "movie" of very low budget that has delusions of grandeur. Difficult to sit through. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow great revelation. I had no idea what was wrong before I saw this. Yes, that is sarcasm. DO NOT see this "movie" if you are offended by male or female nudity. DO NOT see it if you are a little apprehensive. DO NOT see it if you care to act. On second thought, DO NOT see the period. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: making the movie, the premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie frames, director's comment, 2 versions of the trailer, The Azoic music video and a video experiment in the classroom
