Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a minuscule part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are killer slugs in his small town. Not just the slugs, yes, but the larger-than-normal carnivorous killer, mutated by the toxic waste slugs (which still go as fast as a normal slug, which is not that scary, but I'm rambling). No one will believe you at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer slugs are just above the psychotic lazy and below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the chill factor. So the absurdity of all this is quite evident from the beginning. The film is something funny and it is of the variety 'so bad that it's good'. I appreciate you saying that this was Slugs: the movie instead of Slugs: The Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worth seeing more than once and forget it quickly, except for playing a pretty dark question game. The director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is best known for his previous films "Pod People" (which he deservedly mocked MST3K) and "Peices" (which is possibly the funniest bad movie ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Simply a theatrical trailer for this movie
