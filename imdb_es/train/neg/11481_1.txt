If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old wise man to the ground when he was never in danger? He forced the old man to mask the injury out of pride and so the young man would feel guilty leaving him with a disability for life. However, I think that's why the main character rejects the money and why the old man does it like a dog, even when volunteering for an extra job. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he's a long-distance boyfriend, then why is a soldier better? He has a good reason to be jealous, a good reason to get her away from her hometown and overprotect her manipulative and controlling father. All the characters that should be nice are not, and everyone else is the "bad" boyfriend. How did they meet anyway, a wine racer and a sawmill?
