In the many films I've seen from Warren Oates, I've come to a definite conclusion, here's a talented individual. The first time I saw Mr. Oates in the 1960 television series called Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest reputation in a movie called "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia." Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I've always thought that I was able to bring some magic to any character, until I saw it on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the iron detectives of the 50s created by Raymond Chandler. Because, in the synopsis, it was a private eye with a hard nose, I became interested immediately. However, I sat patiently throughout the whole film and discovered that it was a boring, uninteresting, slow-paced, twisted, and confusing saga that, if it had a theme or a plot, it should have been left in some dark room of the room. Collectively and with some of the best secondary stars of Hollywood, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach Five, however, it failed on the platform of launch and did not arrive. where. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a badly made vehicle that never took off. **
