Even if you could overlook the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed all the Significant Moments of the 1960s (well, Katie did not join the Manson Family and nobody died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly horrible. I got the impression that the "writers" simply locked themselves in a room and saw "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60s movies over and over again and called it research. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". He was right.
