I can enjoy a guilty pleasure watch movie, but this is just bad. And it's not bad in a way that I can enjoy watching MST3K make fun of him. It's just nauseatingly bad, since you can not find anything to enjoy about it, no matter how hard you try. I really regret losing 2 hours of precious life in this shit. Seeing him, you can see that nobody was asked to act and that everyone in him knew that this movie would only bury their careers. Apparently, "Walking Tall" has obtained enough income for someone to decide that they could make an effort of their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that it erases the worst movies in my memory.
