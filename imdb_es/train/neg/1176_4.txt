Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is offset by an overabundance of boredom. You do not care who wins, loses, dies or lives, just finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what I think is a superficial use of background technology. The scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality. It is better to be done on an empty stage and be left like this. You can not expect the surprising effects of "The House of Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but, after all, this is a digitally dominated production in 2002. The characters seem to enter a scene by the simple fact of enter a scene, so much that one loses the account of the number of times the characters enter and leave the rooms. In my opinion, this film converts the French Revolution of the 1790s into the "papier-mache" revolution of a "papier colle" world.
