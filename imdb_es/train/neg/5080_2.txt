This is a review of The Wizard, which should not be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a movie of the late eighties about the ability of a very quiet child to play video games and walk during all opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy who joined 100 straws and made a child drink something. <br /> <br /> Now that we have obtained all of that. By the way, let me tell you this: there really is no reason to watch this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the most relaxed sense possible, because it seems that this movie was written a weekend by a team of people who had never played on Nintendo and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and the director would sit down and play some games together, they would realize that they were about to film the total trash and, instead, go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereo. <br /> <br /> I hope this has been an enlightening experience for you. Surely it has not been for me. In fact, I think he might have lost some weights in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're in the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz sitting on the shelf in a nice little row, do not see them and play Duck Hunt.
