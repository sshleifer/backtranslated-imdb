Disappointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young mafia assassin (Chandler) must show his boss that he is a good man for service, so he goes to California to take some lessons with a well-known professional killer (Beluschi). First and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee) that is completely foreign to all of them. But is she an easy target? The movie goes on and on based on this main idea, but the result is simply a bad routine; Even the strange turn at the end does not save the movie. Good performance of Chandler. I give this one 4 (four).
