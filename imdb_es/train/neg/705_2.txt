There is so little here of the fantastic book by Anne Rice that what is here makes no sense. Some of the characters, intense and surprising, do not reach the screen at all, and those who do so are diluted to the point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is it? The relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the romance between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear, since her story was never explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and disadvantage) is that she can pass for white, and her marriage with Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel beating at the hands of his father? We know nothing about Aglae beyond that she is a bitch who hates her husband; Why is there no background that explains this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for the performances, there is not one that is better than the mediocre one, although it is probably due to bad writing. Best of all is the actor who plays Richard, but Richard is not on screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, although, again, it all comes down to the fact that the actress has nothing to do with how little she has given to work. <br /> <br /> In general, this is simply terrible. I thought it would be impossible for any film turned into an Anne Rice book to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that disaster look like a critical hit. How is it possible that Rice is a bitch that allows her best jobs to turn into garbage on the screen?
