A really nasty movie. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if they turn the stomach), it has no other redeeming features. Like many other movies of the 70s, it makes you feel like you have to take a long shower and rub the limo. The characters are uniformly unpleasant, and the plot has no meaning.
