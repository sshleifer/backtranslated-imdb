I'm sorry, but even Adrian Zmed, of TJ Hooker, could not save this sequel. I went through the middle of the movie thinking that this was a parody of the original. Then came that wild and extravagant motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie directed by Patricia Birch); and sadly I realized that they were trying to be serious. I loved the fact that the opposing gang, who had lost their "wheels" because of their playing habits in the original Grease, was forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. Being embarrassed by that putz character Carrington, I'd hate to see what they would turn to later: maybe Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I also never bought the trite issue: hunky-Australian-boy-can't- in-shape-for-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for-tough-guy-with-stupid- biker-helmet-look. It was Disney's story that got terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> So, it seems you CAN ruin something good by putting a piece of gum that hits Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I removed from this movie was an idea of ​​how many points out of ten I would give.
