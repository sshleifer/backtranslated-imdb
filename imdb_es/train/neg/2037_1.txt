If I could give him a zero, he would change his mind and give him a -10 instead. An absolutely horrible movie without a movie plot, it does not make sense of what is happening. Only flat boredom. Please, do not waste your money on this. Please !!! This movie could have done so well if it really described the story of the true zodiac killer, but no, I did not feel anything but disgust while watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies. It's better to see a movie that you've seen 3 or 4 times more than see this shit! I do not understand why people bother to make those movies when they know they're not going to do well. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' instead!
