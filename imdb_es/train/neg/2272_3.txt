I am not a regular spectator of Springer's, but I do see his show at a glance and I think the show is a great guilty pleasure and a good way to kill time. So, naturally, I'm going to watch this movie waiting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored." First, Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's execution time. The other hour and twenty minutes are devoted to building this pseudo-farce on trailer, garbage, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks sexy like HELLLL) is a trailer whore who sleeps with his stepfather (Michael Dudikoff, an unusual-looking chain drunk and who finally turns away from his action hero character). The mother finds out about it, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the "Jerry" program (that's right, not Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take him to the "Jerry" show. The characters collide. Blah, blah, blah blah! Trash has been rarely this BORRINGO !!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them reviewed his movie. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious! If you love or hate it, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It is a total disaster of a moving image (if that is what you call it). It is so badly edited, with scenes that simply do not connect, and after a period of time, the plot practically disappears and is simply on the whole map. Imagine a predictable telenovela transformed into a comic farce. With a few times he laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risky as it gets. Do not get me wrong, the scene is quite risky, but if you look at the film in general by comparing it with Springer's program material, this disastrous farce seems extremely disinfected. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
