I had no knowledge of this movie before buying it, but it sounded great and I've been waiting to see a really full Viking movie for a while ... unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I expected the best, but instead, I was given a boring Nordic soap opera that seemed to go on for too long despite its 84 minute run time. The premise of the film is intriguing enough: it is a Viking warlord who challenges his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as Berserker. This Barek guy is forced to live enraged, insane and violent, life after life. The film was filmed with enough competition, with a rich cinematography and almost good performances by the actors, but again, I got bored and I wondered when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had the opportunity to do something quite entertaining and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics like free nudity and a lot of blood ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, right? The Vikings were supposed to be bad enough, what about all the rapes and looting, so the Berserkers are not supposed to be even more extreme? In general, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc.) or, in fact, you're a demented Berserker who likes self-torture, I'll probably stay away from this piece of celluloid.
