This infamous end of the career of Koen Wauters caught my attention through the "Night of bad taste". Judging by the index of comments, I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe who learned that this musician (certainly one of the best in our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on that) tried to be an actor. Whether he should have made the attempt or not, he can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In 'Intensive Care' he is quite pleasant, but he seems to be uncomfortable with the film in which he participates. No one can blame him. He deserves his classification in the Verheyen Hall of Fame by all means and standards. The story of the killer Maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and irritable has been told dozens of times before, and even without original twists, a director can offer a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography. <Br /> <br /> IC is happy with a hospital wing and a couple of middle-class houses. The rhythm is boring. Tension loses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score, since each appearance of the murderer is accompanied by a tedious threatening melody, followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders, which largely suggest it and, in any case, so bloody as a small budget. You can make them The sex scene is free but not at all attractive. However, the Amsterdamned couple could have made it work. When dealing with the subject of the couple: the whole secondary plot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on the screen if only the future victims had been, who lowered their nerves in the middle of physical intercourse. I will not even give the other cast members the dignity of mentioning them, since they should all have been cut into greasy little pieces. In fact, most of them do it. The ones I remember were obvious for the genre: a pretty nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in a maneuver, the cavalry only arrives on time to need their rescue. The (anti) hero has to eliminate the villain, mainly through intelligent thinking, since the old red berets do not usually participate in these films; they could overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the murderer. Translated into events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the lady in distress. <br /> <br /> There are no people, I have not finished. That's not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic attempt, but is hit with a fury that approaches "The mechanical orange", so it is up to the girl to pick up the act of the piercing killer and pierce the brain of the doctors. Although this method guarantees killer death more than usual in 9mm bullets, the doctor survives to allow IC to reach the 80 minute mark. <br /> <br /> I should have already told my point. Intensive care is a bad movie, which can only be enjoyed by lovers of bad taste, who can verify Verheyen's catchy phrases and make some compensations for themselves and thus try to sit down. For example, the value of the (unintentional) parody of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (the chase at the end of Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude by giving a general overview for a few miserable elements that give a little IC credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue from a fellow French doctor / actor and look horrified when they left him on fire to label his big name on a stand-in. He could have played his part of Naked Gun again, to end up as beef, but with a longer screen time. The end can be one of them. He had never seen a maniac being knocked down by throwing fireworks into his guts to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Name a good point about intensive care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself completely to his musical career. I wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race have to abort before regaining consciousness. <br /> <br />
