It is rare that you feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving due to how bad it was created and the bias of your product. <br /> <br /> I felt a different attempt on the part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as boring and unreliable. We hear them talk about the sadness they feel for oppression, but the film is filmed and organized so that we feel that the politically oppressed population is the Israeli Jewish population. We do not see evidence that is parallel to the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only listen to other Palestinians in prison. I understand that there are restrictions, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I left the movie feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely closed. Because of its side of the fence, so to speak. She continued unwilling to see the pain of the bomber's parents, and her angry, closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. In my opinion, it is more realistic to see that the Israeli mentality is the root of the problem; the reasons for understanding and freedom were ignored; requests for recognition of the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land were ignored. <br /> <br /> I have given this two for this selfish weakness of the mother, which would normally be admirable in a documentary, however, in light of the lack of fairness, everything seems exploitative. Also for the deficient editions, the lack of precedents in the real case and, finally, the lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. In short, it is a poor documentary and a bad movie. I recognize that this is partially the result of the political situation, but I am bound to note the flaws in the direction, regardless of the heartbreaking and sad theme.
