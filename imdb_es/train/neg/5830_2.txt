Drawing Restriction 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art movie? Is there only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork wears what looks like a big hairy pita on his head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when the mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale fat experiment. Or when you're ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most pretentious modern art films. At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretense of being boring to boot. I would call the use of color and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the film looks like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is until it seems that they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will be published later. <br /> <br /> Actually, the parts of the documentary and the fire were the best parts. The plot of the surface is on a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual to fatten the whales. Then, there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcome on the ship when they are subjected to a ritual of humiliation that includes shaving their heads (think about the jokes of the boys in the fraternity), the nicotine patches and the giant hats of pita bread. . Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and let's not forget the giant mob. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney has written that it is "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity". That's almost like saying, "if you do not understand, then you're not creative in your interpretation, so do not worry because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, that's the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it were POST-modern. But, it's supposed to be modern art. What art is about itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's start this whole piece of interpretation, okay? The following lines are only 3/4 bass and should not be taken as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour concerns the pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp is a symbol of the need to elevate yourself according to the standards you estimate, and pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then, in a whaling ship, they build a box that seems to have the crude shape of a whale. Obviously, a crude prefiguration element. <br /> <br /> On the boat, they make the whale fatten within the shape of the whale and remove the portion of fins. They replace this with a spine and later a giant turd. It is assumed that these are the states of the film itself. When he is fat, he is entertaining but bad for you. When it's the spine, it's the "important" part of the movie, or the spine, so to speak. So, the giant crows are the guts of the movie, or when the movie is crap. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney, who arrive in separate boats, put on strange humiliating costumes that are NOT WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. Then, they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the boat of a Japanese sage, who tells them that the boat is marked by the mark when another boat hit it; A clash or an intersection, so to speak. This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to begin to cut their legs and eat them so that they become whales and are the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that this was done in a Robbie Williams video? Then, the pearl divers return with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge that they drop to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney managed to overcome the geometry of the 8th grade, obviously. Or, maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot Bjork's score that takes my ear off? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but in others, you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> The artistic film is one thing, but when you simply throw up all kinds of symbolism in the hope of getting a reaction from the people. , it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often created pieces of surrealistic nonsense, but they were more coherent and / or entertaining than this piece of garbage. A Chien Andalou had the sensibility to pile as much symbolism as he could in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend this? Only if you like the boring films of ALTO ARTE with much symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
