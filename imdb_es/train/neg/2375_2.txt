Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the series Nightmare on Elm Street and once again another bad sequel. I think this is related to the latest sequel to Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD for my birthday, so I could see all the sequels. I can say that I am getting disappointed more and more, although with these sequels, at least the last two, it seems that Freddy lost the advantage. It's almost as if the writers are trying to give a soul to Freddy and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not necessary, I'm sorry for Robert Englund, but it's way below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know, a daughter. Maggie, she does not know that he is her father, but soon discovers what her dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do everything possible to resist his powers, but it is difficult with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating her in her ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it is related to the fifth sequel to the series Nightmare on Elm Street, I prefer to see the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This only had a bad performance, a stupid edition and, above all, a bad idea for a story. I did not like his concept and he simply ruined the idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the master of the death of nightmares, not the father who knows best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
