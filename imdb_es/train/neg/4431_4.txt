This agonizing dramatic comedy received astonishingly excellent reviews when it premiered in 1979. I remember opening the Los Angeles Times movie section and watching a 2-page "Chapter Two" ad full of bright legends like "Better than 'Goodbye, girl'!" and "Neil Simon does it again!" What does Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (remarrying too soon after the death of his beloved spouse) and makes her rusty, unpleasant and, what is worse, unfortunate. James Caan plays Neil - er ... that is, George - a writer who seems unable to return to life after losing his wife; enter the animated Marsha Mason (the real life of Mrs. Simon ... soon it will be the former Mrs. Simon) who tries to love George despite his mood and his general melancholy. Mason is very attractive here and could have saved the day if it were not for Caan's indifference (not to mention a secondary plot in relation to Valerie Harper, painfully thin and blonde, which stops the process). I liked the outburst of Mason at the end ("I'm wonderful! I'm NUTS on me!"), But I did not see a happy ending for these two people ... and time proved me right. ** since ****
