I saw him today, partially attracted by the cast of stars and partly because I've enjoyed many other films of this type. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of poorly cut scenes where continuity simply does not flow, billiards challenge at the beginning, for example. The scenes of fighting with the natives are as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying through the air and the camera cuts a dead native lying motionless on the ground, with whom excels Your thigh Is that instant death? There are also several unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as the little girl is rescued while collecting flowers. Really badly animated clay toys are too painful to look at. If you watch this movie, the crabs that advance at about 5 km / h are the highlight. Somehow, one manages to crawl over David Mccullum and give him a pinch. It is as if there is no time to depart, as when the obelisk of the city falls, the native has all the time in the world to take a step 2 to the left, but does not scream and falls. the. I only give it a 2 for Ekland. And why does the voice of Mccullums develop a stutter as the film progresses?
