The 80s were not very kind to Charles Bronson, the great star at one time. Beginning with 1982's "Death Wish II" and ending with this truly awful movie from '89, Bronson's writers seemed to be trying to outdo each other with progressive rudeness. "D.W. II" left little to the imagination in his portrayal of the rape and suicide of the Bronson character's daughter (a rape and murder of her housekeeper was also shown with a disgusting detail). "10 to Midnight" was the kind of disgusting movie that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing that redeems it. Other films such as "The Evil That Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" films of this period were located along the line between high camp and high barf with their fervent depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) liked to show Bronson, an elderly, tired-looking person, who destroys punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but artisanal prowess ( and the terrible scripts) of these films generally destroy the little energy they may have generated. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite", the last of these movies, is pretty well done, but it really takes the cake in cinematic misery. In this movie Bronson: sodomizes a perverse John; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; he makes incredibly xenophobic comments, among other things that I have fortunately forgotten. It also shows the gang rape of a Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, although well implied). <br /> <br /> What did the people think when they made this movie? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible movies? For anyone interested in their best movies, check out most of the films they made in the 60s and 70s like "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon to 3", "Once Upon a Time in The West "," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rider on the Rain ", etc., etc.
