I was taking care of a family of three small children for one night and his mother gave me this to show them that they had just grabbed him at Wal-Mart earlier in the week. The three children actually became physically ill while they watched him. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something that everyone had picked up from school, but it really could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting How someone can produce this caliber of garbage is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the children did not respond and acted strangely. For any parent who is out there, I recommend that you refrain from allowing young children to watch this movie.
