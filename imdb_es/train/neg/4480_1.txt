Let me start by saying that at the beginning I did not see this movie with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in the movies, and "MTV" stuck on the cover, so I did not expect much. What I expected was a tearful tear, too dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start by saying that I had never read the book. I did not see any other version of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was my main complaint with the movie. God is horrible. The main girl is pretty mediocre, but compared to the rest of the cast is Maryl Streep. The main "hero", Heath, is simply horrible. He can sing clich√© songs that sound decent, but that's it. His performance broke the "sad" moments to be so bad in the points that I just laughed. Isabel's girl was also pretty, and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who could not show emotion. And when he tried, he failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor who played Edward, although it is obvious that the direction was bad because even he was not up to what I've seen him do. Oh, and the father was not so bad for my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small time that I can barely remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More breaks than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the end, I barely understood). EXTREMELY the characters of a face without a real depth for them ... In general, it is not interesting or convincing, nothing that we have never seen before, MUCH better, and nothing worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The ending is what is supposed to be a tear gas. He did not do anything like that. The end is not built at all, it almost feels like a late occurrence. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the end occurred, and when they explained it to me, I should have seen my face of "Wait, when did they say that? What?" Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I've seen, although I understand that the output fades are made because they were originally created for television, but that's not an excuse. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this shit, not even close. Actually, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker look away.
