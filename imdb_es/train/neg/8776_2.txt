Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; in the films of Tim Burton Batman always falls in the shadow of his great villains. Here, he plays a widowed husband who captures radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to make contact with the living ... <br /> <br /> Well, it's supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really gets lost in every place that is crashing you Because there are too many things that end without explanation, without discovery and without interest. So where is the amazing emotion when everything gets so bad in a movie that WHITE NOISE makes a fool of himself? Really bad acting and horrible editing, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to make a reappearance of a thriller, but ends up losing the objective more than ever.
