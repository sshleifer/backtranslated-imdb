I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how bad his movies can be. This particular movie was a complete and absolute waste of time to watch it. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD on which they recorded their photo. and he did look thinner and younger when in the movie he looks like crap. He has his big belly and double chin in his favor and the most miserable and boring look on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot To begin with, it was ridiculous and it lasted too long. The whole movie was coming to the final, where Seagal and his team had to face a group of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer. a lot of useless dialogue and without mentioning the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals' voice even in the middle of a statement. The bent voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and it was quite funny. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in the movie were horrible. Half the time that Seagal went you could not see what was happening. There would be shots of him raising his arms towards the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something like that. It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. Too much slow motion for the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is the worst Seagals movie to date and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or it would have bothered me a lot since I'm a big fan of Seagal the Aikidoist. The action star is fading quickly and seems to get worse with each performance.
