Could someone stop John Carpenter from ruining his reputation continuously and deliberately? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost his self-esteem. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been made by a film student, it is not even worth starting to talk about WHAT was bad, because it was just a Borefest, directed by someone without talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, retire immediately with a little self-esteem and stop spilling garbage like this in a bad tradition from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Instead, get drunk.
