My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / science fiction movies and watch them with our friends to laugh. We saw it on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this movie is horrible, I say it in a good way. Everything about that, the acting, the camera work, the history, the costumes, it's so happy and low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think that in one scene the actors seemed to be walking in their place. I really hope that whoever made this film was not serious when he did it, because if it was, then it would be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them, I recommend this.
