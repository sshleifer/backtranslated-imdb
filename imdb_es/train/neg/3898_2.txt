I am very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still considered one of the best post-war directors in Germany and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I wonder what It is what everyone agrees with this movie. The acting is simply terrible: Hanna Schygulla smiles like an idiot! -, the changes between the Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole movie seems as if it had been made in an attic within two days. It was probably exactly like that and many people seem to take this for "real art", but for me this movie is simply bad and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
