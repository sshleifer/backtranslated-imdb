Just do not bother. I thought I would watch a movie with a lot of talent and action. <br /> <br /> But it becomes boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the movie you have a little social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down. Towards the end it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie too seriously. In this type of movie, even if you do not care about the plot, at least you want a good action. I almost fell asleep in the central / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
