After hearing praises about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Let me start by saying that I'm glad the rent was free at the local library. This movement was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot did not make sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to attack that Texas city and make the group of those characters come out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas provided as good details of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
