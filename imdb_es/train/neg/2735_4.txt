I thought it was not the best episode of recapitulation I've seen (although my partner gave me a handkerchief in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox outside the incessantly fragile "State of Coxismo" in which he finds himself these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the character's hair length (or height, in case of JD) and the youth of the first episodes. I can also see how Zach could be well on the way to a Chevy Chase or is that Matthew Perry? chemical sliding induced by the fall of the prat (already recognized in Conan). A small side note, the song (now stuck in my head) of the janitor-induced dance montage was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
