Oh dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin when it comes to his career in Hollywood. After solid turns in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter, it looked like Jayne was on her way to becoming one of the most popular stars in Tinsel Town. However, an obsession with unrestrained publicity and an appearance in this charlatan relegated Mansfield to the margin, that is, cheap loans in euros until Fox could leave his contract at the first opportunity. <br /> <br /> This movie is really diabolical. A waste of time for everyone, with the exception of Suzy Parker, which is the only thing in this film bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her great performance for the bad results of this movie at the box office, and although she has a hard time with this film, she can only do everything possible with the material. After all, Cary barely turns on the screen, right? After a handful of very good dramas and comedies, Jayne retreats 10 steps in her search for a serious actress by accepting (simply by appearing with Grant) to portray this shrill and idiotic threat. Her Alice character is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, all her appearances in the movie make you nervous. We all know that Jayne could do much better than this scum, and yet here she is marching like a prize pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than fun.
