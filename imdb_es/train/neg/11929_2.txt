He had seen "The Eye" before seeing this one. I really liked "The eye", it was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror movies. So I chose this "enchanted Bangkok" because it was the same director, and it was a kind of popular round here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok haunted" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. They do not scare at all, they are not even disturbing (like "The eye" was) ... nothing. I can not even fill the 10 lines required for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
