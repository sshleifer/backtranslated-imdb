I thought that this movie was a great idea, that it was not delivered. It seems that they found a way to create suspense, but they could not make their payments very well. In one case, the police are on the clock to find the hiding place of the kidnappers. They go carefully from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the abducted man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the accumulation, the police arrive at the same time that he is freed, which is very anti-climatic, to say the least. There are also great scenes of narration that take us "inside the thought" of the terrified husband and wife, which takes away the suspense instead of increasing it. We are fully aware of his tension, and the voice-over is an insult and takes away from the viewer any possibility of having a personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock proved time and time again, which is much more effective. The biggest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and get the fast ending, rather smooth. I mean, it just ... "ends" in a snore.
