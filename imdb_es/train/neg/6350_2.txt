I've seen my part of the Woody Allen movies, and while they're not always great, you can usually be sure you're going to be entertained. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95), since then the ones I've seen have been irregular but visible. And so, when I was invited to see Woody Allen's new movie, Melinda and Melinda, who did not even know it had been released yet, I was happy. I had not really heard much about that, so I expected to be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've seen. The premise is over explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes did not say anything and, however, they spread, I assume that to complete what would otherwise have become a 15 minute short film. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the concept behind this film: two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by representing both scenarios. The problem is that none of these "two movies" is good at all. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen came up with a good idea, but then he ran out of steam, or time, to complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The general level of acting is also remarkably bad: Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it's basically an impression of Woody Allen. Previously, good actors like Chloe Sevigny become annoying, and the worst of all is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because her character is in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is missing, if not it does not exist. Definitely very far from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
