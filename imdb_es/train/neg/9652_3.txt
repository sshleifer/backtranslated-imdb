The film was written 10 years ago and a different director was planning it with SRK and Aamir in the main roles <br /> <br /> The movie was finally made with Vipul Shah directing it and Ajay and Salman starred together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> However, the film falls short due to its handling in the 90s and, what is worse, there are gaps <br /> <br /> The film try to include too many commercial ingredients and also the love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, sharp and too cliche <br /> <br /> Are there gaps like the way Ajay escapes from the airport? London and it becomes a place for him without anyone? Even the way your band starts is not convincing. The second half improves with the turn in the story of Ajay destroying Salman, but unfortunately the climax falls short and the film ends with a bad note <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is normal until below the half. Music is the worst point, most of the songs are mediocre. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ajay offers his best chance, although he is not convincing as a Rock singer, but he is excellent as the negative role of Salman. however, he gets irritated with his punjabi and his nonsense, he only impresses when he takes drugs and, therefore, Asin is not good, just a sample piece that Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is fine
