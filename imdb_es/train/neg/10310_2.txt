Lorenzo Lamas plays some kind of CIA agent, who captures an exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps his daughter and forces her to fight against his former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to bring a bit of credibility to the performance of the not-so-talented team. I must admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, nor of his films. However, compared to O.J Simpson and the comatose wife of Lamas, Kinmont, Lamas seems to be like, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because of the renewed interest in the trial of O.J Simpson, you see because if your parents had cable and additional channels, you could not escape from this movie. in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some imbecile would have this playing on his portable TV. The film itself is a collection of unconvincing action sequences and would be an intrigue, although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after the fireballs and the exchange would be one of the liners that provide some involuntary humor. Also, where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a classic of the entire camp? <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
