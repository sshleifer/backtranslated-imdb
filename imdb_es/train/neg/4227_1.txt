I'm dumbfounded that I really sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror movies and everything related to zombies in general. But when you add none, you have crossed a line that should never cross. I hope that the people in this movie had a great time doing it, at least it was not a total waste. Although you would never know it by looking at it. Script? Are you kidding. Interim? I think even the trees were faking. Cinematography? Well, there must be a camera there. Period. I do not think there was any real planning involved in the making of this movie. Such a total loss of time that I will not prolong it by commenting more.
