There is only one reason to see this movie if it is not related to one of the stars or a producer: the actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this story of slow-moving revenge and tremendously improbable. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to take revenge on her deceiving husband. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her favorite weapon. She wants Nichole (as on Tuesday) to approach her ex (the handsome but bored Stephan Jenkins, who should devote herself to music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good at his brief moments, and former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison has practically nothing to do except frown. Hiltz, on the other hand, comes out several times as sexy and playful, then evil and twisted. She also handles the vulnerable well and "maybe a little psychotic". She is also very good (although there is not a show of naughty parties) so you can understand how she could reach any man she is addressed to. But the performance is wasted in this movie, which is not so bold or interesting enough to recommend.
