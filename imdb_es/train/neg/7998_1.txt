Not only was he invariably annoyed to listen, he had no jokes. I swear, an amateur Asian guy telling jokes to mom would have been more fun than Leary's shit. (Well, maybe it's fun for a couple of minutes, but at least I can laugh at least once!) Leary said he stopped using drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently, he was still drugged something; he was just an impure cracking comedone mostly related to drugs. One of his jokes was something like: 'I would not use crack, especially having the same name as among my nulls' - Oh man, how did you come up with that ?! I swear the only one who needs to shut up is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see it live. This guy totally sucks. <br /> <br /> If you have fun easily swearing, and "joke" where you can create yourself, you can waste your time with this garbage.
