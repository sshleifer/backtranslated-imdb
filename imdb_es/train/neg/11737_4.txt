Well, I do not think the image is as bad as most reviews say it is. . . but you can not deny that you have problems. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the problems are in the script. There is a plot, but not much history, and certainly not one that anyone can call plausible; Try any number of characters, lines, moments, things that you have and in a stereotyped way, strangers and with your own conscience, and in the end, you just have not added much in this department. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I could not care less what "social disease" Farnsworth is trying to solve; There will always be a sector of the population willing to do almost anything to destroy their brains, even if it is required to run around the corn fields that try to steal ammonia, or whatever those idiots do. So, as a movie, you will not find me saying "Iowa" is "important". But at the stylistic level, the image is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth's options for describing a methamphetan's head state are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and, yes, I will say, inspired. <Br /> <br /> The acting is uneven, but that may be a victim of the stylistic scope previously praised. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress, but she's not very good here, so a member of the audience should ask her, "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster achieves a simplicity and grace that very few of the other actors can approach. For example, he could seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth can provide for Michael T. Weiss's overdue shift as probation officer, but I doubt he will ever buy it; It just does not work <br /> <br /> Once again, it is the most alive and at the moment I have seen John Savage appear in years. Then, imagine. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that torments, but does not promise, and that's fine; Farnsworth and no one else are forced to make movies. Therefore, it remains to be seen if Farnsworth has another movie in him, but if he does, it seems quite likely that it is not insipid. At a time when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of "American Idol," perhaps we could afford, not disdain, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably flawed film. <br /> <br /> What's more, perhaps we can welcome, not scold, your energetic and even sometimes idiosyncratic imagination.
