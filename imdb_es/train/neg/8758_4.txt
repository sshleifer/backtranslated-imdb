It is not a film, but a synchronized collection of performances of acts that were part of the British Invasion, which followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles into the world of music. Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond, but many of them did. They present themselves to Hermit Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course, the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's really fun to see these young people before. They sharpened and polished their actions.
