Wow, what the heck of a movie! ... I said that I wanted to become a specialist in bad films of all decades, so I decided to start with this one. It was a pretty adequate choice. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and masterpieces without understanding, but I saw nothing of the kind in this mess of pastel colors. I have not seen many bad films before, but I have the feeling that this is what is called "so bad that it's good", probably because it's so funny! In the first place, there are the inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies related to the plot, physical inaccuracies and psychological inaccuracies. The last ones, in particular, are as crazy as Van Damme's buttocks inside that blue spandex. The extremely sticky lines also exist and I'm not even going to start talking about some of the fun action moves. There is not exactly bad acting by everyone involved in the disaster of a movie, except in a particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, who is an absolutely stupid character. And, to tell the truth, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in the two roles that convinced me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
