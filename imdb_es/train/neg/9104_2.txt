<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie the last night at Cinemax, I was surprised that it had been done. Cruel intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best films for teenagers made in years. This prequel had certain things incongruent with the original. (Sebastian's father married wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on a long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I discovered today that I was not really destined to be a new movie, but rather a TV series. , Manchester Prep. After hearing that, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series was not picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian became the male version of Katharyn) and I do not know where they would go with the next episode, since it would not lead to the 1999 film (which the most recent the end is directed directly towards). <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like was that it suggested that Sebastian and his father had married wealth, which does not look good in this area of ​​New York, and Sine Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of it, it did not seem like something a woman would do in her position, marry a man who is not of her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel this is quite scarce. But I would have been interested to see where he had gone in series.
