You receive a gift It is exquisitely wrapped. The box in which it is found is made by hand with the best wood and shows skill to the smallest detail. Then it is wrapped in a lovely paper, hand made and hand painted by the most talented artists. Everything is wrapped in ribbons made of fine silk lace. It is a sight worth contemplating. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, you tear the paper, you open the box and you do not find ... nothing. That is TOYS. Either you like the packaging, or you forget about it. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its purpose and purpose: war is not a good thing. Well, is not that original? The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. And even that weak vision is undermined by a story in which elements of war, particularly war toys, are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war with innocent toys. It is as if someone preached a severe and condescending sermon, only to end by saying "Just kidding." <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the film is not examined closely. Yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable and surprising images. The scenarios are imaginative and the cinematography captures the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the script, the look of the film is sad and, at times, aesthetically sterile and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, but it shows that they are creations of an empty and cold world. The film strives to be funny, in a morose way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, like the beleaguered heir to a toy-making empire, sets out on his improvisational game, which only seems alien to the strange and coldly structured world in which he lives. In fact, the topical references and insipid sexual innuendo that are scattered are contradictory to the childhood fable that the film is trying to be. For this film to work, or make sense, it must be established in its own universe, an Oz away from Kansas. Every time the jokes bring us back to reality, the world of the movie's toy becomes more and more an obvious farce. <br /> <br /> It is said that this was the favorite project of director Barry Levinson, one of whom he had worked hard to do. for ten years. It is sadly obvious why he had problems getting support. Like most of the pet projects that are finally made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: THE EARTH are great examples), it seems to be a blind spot in the field of vision of the filmmaker. Maybe Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he did not have a fresh vision for that when he finally came on stage. I had perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys that appear in the film are clumsy, mechanical and rope monstrosities. This is the movie itself.
