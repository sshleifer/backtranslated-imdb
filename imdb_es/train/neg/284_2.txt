['Just today, I picked this up at the only 99 cents store today, and I still think I got ripped off. &quot;Dream to Believe&quot; is a rather boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama, and $ 1 is too expensive for this. This movie is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It&#39;s run by Paul Lynch, the man who also made Promo Night. Now in the movie. <br /><br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D&#39;Abo) who is seriously injured in a car accident that also cost her father her life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastics tournaments, she is often stopped during her classes and, finally, she meets a wild boy named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin, when he is not training, works part time, together with his mother. and stepsister, in a laundry owned by his abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /><br /> In general, only Keanu and some catchy melodies of the 80s are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it is not one of the worst movies, but it is far from being good. The DVD itself does not receive any medal, since it seems to come from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound desynchronizes and when the final credits are almost finished, it fades to black, although the sound can still be heard. So this It can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD illustration also makes no sense, since it has what appear to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the film, since it is not in the film itself either, so the cover is Obviously from photoshop. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you are a Keanu fan. I&#39;m probably not going to be aware of that anymore. I&#39;m probably going to give it to The Cinema Snob, who is a great critic of YT by the way. Hey, if any of you have bad quality movies that you do not want to see in your eyes anymore, feel free to donate to keep your program going.']
