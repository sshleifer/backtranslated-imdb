This movie is something like a sequel to "White Zombie", since it is made by the same man (Halperin) and presents zombies. However, Halperin, the George A. Romero of his time, does not comply with this. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and a quest to destroy the source of His power so that zombies can be sent for free. In addition, a love interest for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this film really stands out is in the images. The temples and dancers of Cambodia are very nice and the zombie looks very powerful in its great number. Unfortunately, we can not see many zombies in action and the love story seems to play too big a role for a horror movie (although this has a valid argument reason later). <br /> <br /> I would have loved to see some zombies of the 1930s attack the defenseless people of the city, but this movie simply was not delivered. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but deceiving since it is never in the film ... why not recreate this with the eyes of the new actor? In general, a film that could be excellent with a small reworked script and someday could be a powerful remake (especially if it is maintained in the same postwar period). Hell, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie has hope.
