A friend of mine was in the cast as an FEDS agent (a part that does not speak, as a souvenir). He brought it on DVD so I could watch it. It was "interesting", but it felt like an amateur movie. A well-made amateur movie, however. Really boring and badly written. It was probably fun to do and participate, but it definitely did not deserve any kind of broad release. Maybe in Omaha they enjoyed it, but this girl from California was bored and honestly a little embarrassed by my friend's participation. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker has made or makes more movies, he should try. They have a very interesting story, and good actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish you luck in the future, and I hope you can improve your filmmaking.
