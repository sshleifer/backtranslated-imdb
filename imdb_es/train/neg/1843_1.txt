Wow. Just horrible I was a fan of the original movie, and reluctantly sat through part 2, 3 was and improves. 4,5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But NOTHING is as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy acts as the host of this anthology series by Rod Serlingesq. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became one auction after another, but at least in the movies the appeal of Freddy led to the movies, but here they were. bad facts, they seemed like secondary productions of a series of terror. Poor actors, if they really want to call themselves that after doing this show, they were obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Those who are starting on the Hollywood ladder, completely new, willing to take on any part that prevents them from having the porn work that was offered to them last week, or experienced actors on their way down the Hollywood ladder willing to take whatever part they put They stopped having to accept the porn work that was offered to them last week. <br /> <br /> I almost expected that Dana Plato would be the guest star, but I was already dead when this was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "Whatever you do try not to fall asleep seeing this."
