Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when assuming this role. <br /> <br /> The main role plays (for me) a complete stranger and I imagine that it would disappear in the dark just after this turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led the charge of martial arts in the early 70s and since then the fighting scenes have to be based on martial arts or at least brutal if street fighting techniques are used. This film uses quick cuts to show martial arts, however, even this can not disguise the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a punch. An average child of 8 years would disarm her in this show. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery shown here is how this did not win the golden raspberry for your year.
