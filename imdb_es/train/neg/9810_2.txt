It's hard to criticize this movie, because I do not like the story itself, and no good performance would have saved it. Think of "Raising Arizona" with a bad streak. The acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly is exaggerated (though not enough to make this a good camp movie), as usual, somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has their eyebrows woven perpetually in consternation, either by the stress of their parts or by the stress of the entire useless exercise. A really degrading hours of cinema. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I left, I'm sorry.
