I was not very impressed by the offer of Dante's first season in "Homecoming", it was not a horror story, but an intelligent political statement with the undead. The situation of Screwfly is the story of a virus unleashed in the world that causes the sexual impulse of men to be replaced by murderous tendencies towards women. The episode begins well with a short film that explains how scientists killed the screw fly. Then there is a brief scene where a man is arrested when the bodies of females are discovered in his house. I suppose this is supposed to indicate the beginning of the outbreak, but it is not clear why it is never visited again. The episode is presented for a while and features characters blah, blah, blah. It seems great and mysterious, but the episode gets worse and worse as it progresses to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode Well, except for chocolate.
