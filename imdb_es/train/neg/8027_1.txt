I saw this movie. Until the end. And that was not really easy. It is so boring, badly played and in almost all the stolen details of "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe that the manufacturers take it seriously. Even harder to believe, is how this "product" became VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see a horror movie, just look at "Scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have fun, watching some kids running through the woods shouting at each other and demonstrating their inability, observe the dark areas.
