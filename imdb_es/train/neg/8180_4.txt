The reason why the DVD releases of this film are black and white is because no one can get a color print of this public domain movie, a modest marine story at best. <br /> <br /> Distributed for television through Allied Artists, DVD (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title come from the same 16mm television print. Films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in black and white prints, because most viewers did not have sets of colors anyway. The print of black and white prints for television was also cheaper, since it often involved enough prints to cover all the stations that published a film in a syndicated way.
