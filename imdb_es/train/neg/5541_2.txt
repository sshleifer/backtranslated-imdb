Since the movie-loving universe met a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with horror images soaked in blood and non-stop sequences of performances. It's safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. However, in the early years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was used simply in slow psychological thrillers, almost without action. "I walk with a Zombie" by Jacques Tourneur is a perfect example and so is "White Zombie", starring Bela Lugosi. This "Revolt of the zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately it is a failure in the whole line and easily one of the most tedious movies I've seen. Terrible acting, a badly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension. The film only lasts 65 minutes and, nevertheless, the first half hour is completely wasted in stupid intrigues of love stories and uninteresting monologues. The location in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could surely have resulted in a more compelling story, but all we see are interior shots. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, a textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me greatly and I kept waiting for a ravenous undead to suddenly appear to devour her. Unfortunate again ?? If you manage to fight for 60 soporific minutes, you will be rewarded with a decent enough ending. However, this is too little to give this film a positive rating, much less a recommendation. Avoid! This is the kind of movie you should only watch in case you've already seen everything else.
