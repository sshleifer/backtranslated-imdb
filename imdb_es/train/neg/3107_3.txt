Woody Allen made "September", proving that even a genius could ruin. This is the "September" of Mel Brook. Monumentally stupid, bored and without grace, I must confess that I did not observe it until the end. The film is among the few disgraced (for example, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that put me to sleep or forced me to look for the "rewind" button. And I say this, sadly, as a devoted fan of Mel Brooks. I should stick to direct comedy and leave social commentaries alone. How the same guy who did "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could make a dog like this do not beat me. It must be avoided at all costs.
