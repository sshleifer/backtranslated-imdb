The movie is worth 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (sorry, I'm partial, I think the pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it's shorter than Azumi 1. I saw Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seats . I was surprised to be able to sit through him. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the positive points of the movie. The woman. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all there is to save the whole movie. The fact is that, if the main character were male, I'm sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the negative points. First of all, it is a true draggy, with many repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It seems more like a dramatic way to shoot. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. Second, the film is too unreal in a historical context. I do not care about unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativity, throwing ninjas that act like bears and cobwebs, etc ... it reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. In addition, to describe the "i-don't-know" effect, the director films people who die with blood sprays (literally) around ... people who have not realized that their heads were cut off .. . etc etc. etc ... Too many of these spoil the show. It seems that the influence of anime is strong in this movie. The show is very degraded. Third, is not Azumi supposed to be a murderer? She looks more like a one man army to me, just that she is a woman. I do not think you see killers carrying in army camps. The only time I felt I acted like "I liked a killer" was when he killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot without development and surprises in any way.
