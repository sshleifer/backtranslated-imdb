This was a "cute" movie at the beginning, then it became too silly and presented mediocre songs, at best. <br /> <br /> There is too much English that King James talks about not only is it annoying in today's world, but it is not always that way. easy to interpret Can you imagine the young people of today trying to listen to this movie? Forget this. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and it's nice like "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also, in addition to her good looks and her beautiful long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie with an ending to feel good, and I can not stop doing it. Maybe this is worthy of a rental, for historical reasons or if you're a big fan of Crosby but, in general, it's not much.
