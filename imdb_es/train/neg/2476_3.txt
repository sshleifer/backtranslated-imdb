['Despite all the subtle charms that this student film may contain, did anyone else get bored with death waiting for WENDINGO to show off his paper macho face? <br /><br /> The anti-climax pretty much ruined any kind of momentum that we had to accelerate to develop. <br /><br /> Do not get me wrong, I&#39;m exploring the darkest part of America, but this is a turd-a-flamb√© that can be seen only by the fact that p.clarkson looks good taking it. <br /><br /> Unfortunately, of a boy with wings. <br /><br /> The best 2 minutes the movie has to offer. <br /><br /> If you feel like cheating, you can do better.']
