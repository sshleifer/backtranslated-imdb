['It&#39;s probably the worst performance I&#39;ve seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens with the casting. The protagonist of this film has some type of disfigurement of the nose and it is almost impossible to look at it for a period of time without looking at its nose. You could go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified and better looking women. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because I had a &quot;great&quot; DVD case. This movie seems to be just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical university. I would rather have passed the time or so this movie was watching public access television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anybody who sees in this movie.']
