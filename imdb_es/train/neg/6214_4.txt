What?!?? Why do people say that this is "amazing?" Face it, the end is one of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! There are 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention that character 9 was an idiot all the time he killed everyone. He was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9, then none of this would have happened. The people who give lives there for a stupid cause and why? ... for it to rain? I admit that the movie had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many of them were clich√©s one after the other. And did anyone else have the feeling that this looks a lot like "The Lord of the Rings"? The characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself if it's good to have only four guys in the world; It is useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've seen, and thank God! How robots become creative against humans in some way! It has been done a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that is worth watching as Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, those were good movies!
