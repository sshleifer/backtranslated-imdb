I bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary exploration expedition to Mexico before confronting the Aztecs. Luckily he did it because he would never have known about the T Rex who inhabited a particular valley where the locals worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> That was understandable. What was not the casting of the blue eyes of Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with blonde hair that became famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked positively ridiculous. At least he did not try the Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez, who is also late for a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas. P.S. Find true love with an Aztec princess and life would be perfect if it were not for those annoying prehistoric beasts that adore the natives. <br /> <br /> It seems that the Aztec tyrannosaur used some shots of the famous series Sid & Marty Krofft. The land of the lost. All that was needed was a bit of Sleestak to appear. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in discovering this reconnaissance expedition that did not get to do history books by all means, check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try to sit with a serious face.
