Cube's first film was an art film. He established a world in which all the major archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world they could not understand. It was, on the non-literal level, a plot of "man against cruel nature", where the individual who represented innocence and kindness came to the end, triumphing to face a new and indefinable world beyond the small disputes of man; A world where there was no more struggle, but peace. I qualified Cube with a 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that never had the intention of having sequels. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube was a big disappointment. Some of the ideas were great, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the stage had no meaning or meaning. Still, for being quite entertaining, I rated it with a 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, is played as a commercial B-movie replay that is far inferior to the first , sans the symbolism. There is no "homage" or "homage" here; there are only scams The same type of plot, with some idiotically modified elements (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes, an idea that shows more clearly that this is a scam with absolutely no originality or anything to say). br /> <br /> That we see something "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because the observers are only part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of whom we know nothing. And, in this movie, those who reach the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are killed, where is the meaning of * bleep *?! That's just stupid flipin 'I'm glad I did not pay to see this. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​and performance in Cube Zero are not that bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of inspiration that this film I can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.
