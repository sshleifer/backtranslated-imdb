An original image of the mediocre science fiction channel. A little twisted, but not much. The United States nuclear-powered submarine. Jimmy Carter is on a mission far below the thick icy ice near the North Pole when he is attacked by giant super charged electric eels. A member of the crew (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) believes that he has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but he is not given much opportunity for vague reasons. Also among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
