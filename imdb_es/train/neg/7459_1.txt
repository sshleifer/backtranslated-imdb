Please save your money and go see something else. This movie was a piece of shit. I did not want to go, but I had to do it so I thought I would laugh at least once, NOPE. Not a single laugh, it was so horrible! Chris Kattan will never have a good comic role after this and "one night at the Roxbury". This movie is completely obvious, it has no intelligent humor and it is repeated again and again. Listen to me, and get away as far away from this movie as you can!
