Terrible movie If there is a Turkish movie that you should avoid watching in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Apart from a couple of cheap laughs, this movie achieves nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Dialogue is cheap, and sexual clich√©s are everywhere. The director needs to see more movies before trying to direct his own movie. The red-haired woman shows examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning not to act, this is a perfect example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I must have really disliked to write about this so much. OMG!
