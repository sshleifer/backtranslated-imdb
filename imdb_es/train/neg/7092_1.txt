<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie, clearly recorded in a cheap camera) can be one of the best cinematic bombs in history. Beware: the packaging announces the film as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is not more erotic than looking at one's own warts. The script has no meaning and is meandering, with all the elements of the plot that serve as segways between alleged sex scenes. However, even sex scenes are unconvincing. Except for the first, they last about three seconds (again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overloaded. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want this. If you are looking for an exciting sex movie, you do not want this. Regardless of the goals, desires or perspectives of your life, you do not want to see this movie. The way they managed to get Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act on this stinking bomb is a disconcerting extreme.
