Basically, the team of a husband and wife dentist and his 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good and the music, although sometimes it is abrupt and without direction, is quite good. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The husband's dentist leaves his wife behind the scenes in an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then returns to give him something, but he sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his anguish over this episode, his visual hallucinations and a selfish alter ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear of confronting his wife so he does not have to "do something about it". "I will not tell you the end, but let me tell you that the movie is not going anywhere and that the ending is like a whimper.The characters' motivations are missing: Why is he cheating? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father, the movie does not say it, with whom does she do it? Do not expect any response on that either, why do you want to keep the marriage in spite of all this? Who knows, what are all the children who vomit for? Where is this movie going? The good performances of Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are completely wasted in this stupid nonsense that does not know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family movie. Avoid it
