I think that is a horrible movie produced and directed. Benicio Del Toro should not work in film production, he should emphasize his performance and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed the central point of the idea about the revolution, about its ideals, and especially about the life of Che Guevara, etc. The camera is horrible, as if someone with 2 days of work experience was filming with her, the music is ... I do not know ... is there any music in the movie? I will not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It's just losing about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever ... I can not understand how anyone can rate this movie more than 3 stars. DISASTER ... DISASTER ... DISASTER ... DISASTER Do not look please. Save yourself from this misery of "movie"
