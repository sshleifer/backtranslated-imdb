Interestingly, Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this release for the "man in the mac" and also in "Fade into Murder" . <br /> <br /> Also, it's not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman has written the two scripts mentioned above (by the way, he plays the role of the security guard murdered here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is rarely convincing and many of the artists simply look disinterested with the material. The story is rather weakly developed with some prolonged periods of boring conversation. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also followed by a colleague here (similar to "Last Salute to the Commodore") but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, the characterization of Celeste Holm, which aims to provide comedy, causes embarrassment instead of laughter. <br /> <br /> The script hesitates to discuss the family history and the murderer does enough to give the case to Columbo, although there is never a credible discussion related to the motives of his crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what turns out to be, possibly, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment of the series. Ask a male hairdresser and have a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are fun: it's just that Columbo's hair is perfectly arranged, so he can not pay the bill and then, when he consults a jeweler, he keeps looking in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment of a script that seems to have been improvised in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo completistas.
