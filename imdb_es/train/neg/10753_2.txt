Del - "You are the most foolish and intelligent person I have ever met". <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in the rewrites." <br /> <br /> I think what surprises me most about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was in fact one of the first strong female protagonists, capable of thinking how to solve a problem. Here she is just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are past references to the Laws of Asimov Robotics, but they are a late occurrence in the CGI and the action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is nice, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not so good. You discover it long before these geniuses do.
