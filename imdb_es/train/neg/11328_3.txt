From time to time I will rent an action / adventure movie as a way to relax and occupy my mind without anything important. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000): it's not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. . For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something like a badly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's performance was very communal (not bad for a professional boxer and an amateur actress). There were some high points on the part of the cyborgs. Somehow, they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys, unfortunately, most of them die quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the more you get into the movie, the more emphasis you make. There is action, and the plot (which was not strong to begin with) deteriorates almost as fast as the performance. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devotes to her butt. By the end of the movie, I was seriously considering watching her for the second time just to count the number of times that Kathy Long's tight red shorts were the center screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was not enough meat for this. Film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing for a second time. If you are a Xena fan who needs something to waste a few hours, go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents on rent. There are some strong similarities between the program and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect more than a little fun for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, it happens that you like the derriere of Kathy Long. THEN you may want to buy a copy.
