<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity in my film program, and I thought it was horrible, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, trite, mean and phenomenally self-important. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a fan of the movie, and all the things the movie has to offer. If I want to see a documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, I'll see A & E ... and probably be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
