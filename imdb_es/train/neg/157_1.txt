In the first place, it seems that the video was filmed in the 80s. I was surprised to find out that it was published in 2001. Second, the plot was everywhere, from the beginning the story is confusing. If there had been a brief prologue or introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate the fantasy but this movie was too much. It was strange and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I would recommend Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and the development of the good character) not this movie. Be careful, you will be disappointed.
