I wonder what the people who gave a 10 in this saw that I did not. This movie has a VERY difficult time to follow and / or remain in a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% odd drama and 2% comedy. All the actors have a great performance that can not be denied, however, it seems that they really lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and had to be edited or what. This had potential and, on the other hand, it was really a failure. I would really like the hour and a half that you invested in this movie, but the video rental place does not make returns on time. Save your money and see something else.
