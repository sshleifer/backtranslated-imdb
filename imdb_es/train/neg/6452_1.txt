You already know the story ... Beautiful children alone in the woods, when BAM! Something begins to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well, this shit is not different. A group of children returns to a cabin where the male leads to twins The brother disappeared years ago. Suddenly, a star of "GROWTH OF EXPLOITATION" cuts them out, and their only help is a doctor / cyclist. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie was bad is an understatement, it's great! The acting was horrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very corny. And as all movies do these days, they try to get you a sinuous ending, and they do not! <br /> <br /> There is a bright spot in this movie: LOST star, Maggie Grace, as the female lead.
