The first half of this movie is a pure delight. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performances A very close brother and sister who live in Manhattan fall in love with the same woman! Adult. Sparkly. Witty. What more could you want? As a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. It goes to the unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It goes from being a universal comedy for adults to an arrival story at dawn that has been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a movie people start with such promise. Why does it have to become such a pedestrian movie "I am who I am"? The final picture of Heather Graham's frozen image jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness finding herself" underscores the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. He ended up being the same old man as always.
