One of the most unpleasant films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after seeing him. I saw this film in my History of the United States class and the purpose was to see an incitement to the life of a farmer in the West in the late 1800s. What we saw were pigs that were shot and then slaughtered, human births, brands. Oh, and at the end a live calf was born and let me tell you that the birth itself was not so bad, but the numerous fluids that came out took most of the people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was fine. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move west to be the owner of this cowboy's house. They live a life of difficulties and it is an interesting rather accurate view of life in the West at the end of the 19th century. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
