Hello everyone, if you saw "Singing in the rain", you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make them laugh." If you saw "Royal Wedding", you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the dance number of the title choreographed by the King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what is missing here. There could have been some very successful dance numbers in this presentation. The closest thing was "I can do that" by Chuck McGowan. The simple fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together is not a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He pointed the camera at the stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Yelling at people who show up for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be as bad as if he were in a Western comedy or a comedy. He is fine when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him screaming at someone we would like to shout at him. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good, except Michael, of course. You could have made a good movie even using the songs that were in the theatrical production, but someone should have thought about how to film it. <br /> <br /> The next time you do one of these, I hope you call me first. . <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
