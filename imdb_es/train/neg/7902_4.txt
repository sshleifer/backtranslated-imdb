Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another clone of the Gremlins that emerged from the 80s. I'm not a fan of imitations. <br /> <br /> First there were the excellent 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the very common 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the 'Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But full wells would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> <br /> Now 'Munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. In fact, I probably found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but I prefer the darker tone. <br /> <br /> From the first moment she plays with her silly nature (which is better for her), but due to that nature, the performance of hammy (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) can be quite dominant that you prefer only go to the sandwiches running madly. That's where the fun happens. However, most of the fluff is light, since the story focuses mainly on the sandwiches (which are hungry, horny and destructive) in a lot of supposed comic encounters (some moments work) in the small desert town like a couple of people in pursuit. It's silly, but strangely attractive thanks to the dizzying pace. The creatures themselves look quite insipid and ill-detailed, since they are basic dolls that move on them. Where their personalities came from is that they can really talk ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and a fighter Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were just leaders. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Entertaining entertainment for the most demanding.
