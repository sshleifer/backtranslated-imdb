A teenager who seems to have everything commits suicide. He leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking many questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly handled. To begin with, this has been done before 1988, mainly in television movies and special after-school programs. Apart from some oaths and dialogues (hence the PG-13 rating), this did not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts to act were really painful to watch. It's good now, but not in 1988. Apart from that, his character was dressed like a bum and he always looked so dirty that it was hard to generate sympathy. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie is boring. I saw every scene that was coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. Basically, I could not wait for this to be resolved. <br /> <br /> I have a vague memory of having seen him in a theater in 1988 and having hated him (BADLY has bombarded him). It still looks bad almost 20 years later. It is worthwhile to handle the subject, but it has been done better (with better performance) in many other films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can omit this.
