A friend gave it to me and told me it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive leading actress in the porn industry. Even more terrible is that she is on screen practically all the time. But I read somewhere that in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value. Although I could not find it. See it only if you are interested in the history of the development of pornography in general, or if you can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.
