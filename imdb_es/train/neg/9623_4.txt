Ben Stiller does not act as much as he reacts. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that happens around him. In There Something About Mary, the standing hair scene only works because Stiller tries to keep his face serious. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the most unhappy guy in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula is broken for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by a variety of comedic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are very few. Having said that, Hoffman relies too much on body humor: you know we're in trouble when they go joke jokes to make you laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman criticizes him is completely exaggerated (although he presents a problem in the form of a shirtless opponent raising a smile, notably through Stiller's reaction). However, they all seem to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller could have been played much, much more. Aniston returns to repeat her role as Rachael, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more like a "Joey with a crush with Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a romantic comedy of numbers and that is her fault: she lacks heart. You do not support the characters. With a little more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end, the failure of the film is reduced to bad writing. It is worth seeing if it appears on television on a slow night, but you will regret having taken out cash to see it.
