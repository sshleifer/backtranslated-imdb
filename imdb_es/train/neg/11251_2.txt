Sky Captain is possibly the best horrible movie I've seen in a long time. Crammed with amazing special effects and special effects, studded with a top-notch cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi) and competing with an overused Indiana Jones-esquire story, this should have been a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 'It should have' to be the key term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a hurried accent and a lot of over-the-man, smiles that melt your heart, but you can not do anything with anything, and even your frivolous deliveries and his youthful appearance can not save the stone dialogue of the film. (If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi in the back and said, "Good boy, Dex," just ONE more time, he could have stolen all the guy in front of him.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing less than a grid nervous. His nasal moans and his not so sarcastic comments age in the first ten minutes of the movie. Maybe she put too much effort into playing the heroine of the stereotypical 30s comic, who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90s movie "The Phantom," starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the salvations of the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eye patch, I'll admit it.) In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to overcome the tired material and offer a more fascinating performance than their two-dimensional and dry castmates. <br /> <br /> The plot and the constant progression of the story were old, boring and basically a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the last thirty years. The rhythm is fast in the first half of the film, and that of a snail in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the final conclusion of the film, but also to discover who the key villain is. The pairing is rather clich√©, too: Polly Perkins and Sky Captain seemingly meet after several years of separation from a bitter romance, and their story is not as charming and eclectic as it is annoying and uneven. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings toward the end of the movie, no one is surprised, and no one really cares. <br /> <br /> Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in tight vinyl for her. the whole movie, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on his face. It's not even worth the $ 2.75 I paid to enter the theater.
