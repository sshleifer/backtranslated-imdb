San Francisco is a great city with great acting credits. In this, the filmmakers did not try to use the city. They did not even handle the basics of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone based on being a San Francisco movie. He will not think "oh, I've been there", he will think "how did a stinky two-story firetrap / armpit become a silent hotel lobby?" Some of the contacts used speech styles and affectations of the east coast. This subtracted value, but the performance was always competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least at the beginning. The history of Chinatown was the most effective and interesting. The plot is a weak and torn scene for the scene of the classic action movies of Hong Kong. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and they walked better. But the acting is fun and we can see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the white boy did not make sense. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with that, so they left it unstructured and cut it. The father is a strange attempt of a Berkeley liberal (in fact, friends, everyone knows that it is not "wonderful" to live in the ghetto), but their segments are the most comical. They threw some good opportunities. Educated and bitter on the west coast, an imbecile yuppie here is a different kind of yuppie imbecile than they do in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting; this was not <br /> <br /> The introduction of Hunter's Point was the most disappointing. It was the most derived of the three, and stylistically the farthest of San Francisco. You've seen it done before and you've done it better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and the aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to make its way in the clumsy direction ... about ten minutes before end. Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a lost minority here, to see if you can guess which one.
