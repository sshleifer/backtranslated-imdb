As a child, Hinako moved from her small town to Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to discover that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She meets with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrecting through the island of Shikoku. Oh boy I rented this because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is an ingenious actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This movie is silly, boring, badly filmed, unimaginative and, above all, without a doubt. Kuriyama has a minimal screen time as a resurrected Sayori, and his character has little to work with.
