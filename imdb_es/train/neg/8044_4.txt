Well, well, I saw this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I took it out of the dusty shelf to see it again and I must say that, actually, I think this movie is good. This movie got a buzz when the bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, as Final Stab was for Scream 4, and well, this movie is not that bad. I mean it had flaws and, of course, it would be ridiculous to release this in theaters, but even so, for a popcorn movie at midnight, this movie is not bad. It has some scares, and some really hot women that I could add. In addition, it shows the new robust aspect of Joey Lawrence, although obviously, even that has not won any important role in Hollywood ... I feel bad for the man, had such a big career in the early and mid-90s with flowers. some Disney films and the eternal show of the Lawrence brothers ... Joey Lawrence was a bit of a player in the comedy scene, but then, as in a 360 degree turn, his career went south just making movies of low budget like this. <br /> <br /> The movie also makes you unprepared, it makes you think that among the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, that they will only be disappointed in the end to discover the secret. It also throws you on who is the killer, I had an idea, but still did not believe that the murderer was who he was, but his reasons combined with the secret were a great disappointment. Now, has there been a secret that was revealed? This movie could have been one of the best rated movies. But I'm also a fan of university subjects and I also went to college during spring break at a beach mansion similar to the one here, so I felt sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> A so flick slasher Good for a midnight movie.
