This film represents the times when it was made as much as the original, I suppose. What is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title "Vanishing Point" of the original, is very ironic. I'm sure it was not intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970 and launched in 1971. The REAL "POINT OF VANISHING" was the end of an era, which practically ended in the early 70's. /> <br /> In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been eliminated, and have become more PCs in an attempt to reach a wider audience, probably. "Disinfected for your protection" <br /> <br /> Insert scenes of the American Indians was free, and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the trip was to subtract by addition. I'm glad I saw it, however, it made me appreciate the original much more. The original is a cult and gold classic. This new version is terrible.
