There was not a single redemption factor in this movie. The girlfriend and I love action movies. Especially scenes of fights (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were incredible), but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a problem character who has seen the battle and, therefore, is forced to be severely constipated at all times. The Army has interrupted their bowel movements in addition to perfecting their combat technique. Music is not good either. They fight against rap and the hip-hop style of the streets, because these guys are bullies. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise of low budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B style. The actors deliver their lines as if they read them from reference cards and the same lines should catch fire and be left in flames in some rotten Hollywood alley. The movie is called "Honor", but there was no honor in making this film. It was just a waste of money, and spending wisely is something I consider honorable. <br /> <br /> Go see Felon instead. The scenes and situations of struggle are more real.
