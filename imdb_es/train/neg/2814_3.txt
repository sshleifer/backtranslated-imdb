1st seen 08/26/2001 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Amazing, but sadistic (which makes sense) the representation of a relative of the Marquis de Sade doing the same sadistic acts and enjoying what his predecessor supposedly did. This Tobe Hooper movie really is not very different from his similar style Freddy Krueger films with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) who plays a double role (the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It also seems that he really wants to mess with Christianity, but then loses that in the end, to my disgust, but leaves an inconsistent feeling in the movie. It could have been much worse if the excesses were taken in sex and violence, but they try to keep this to a minimum despite some unpleasant scenes. My last thought is why Hooper would want to make this movie. Obviously, it took a while for it to be distributed, then it has to be advertised in an awful way and with the name of Hooper in the title to earn some money with his name and his gore. It is obvious that this did not work.
