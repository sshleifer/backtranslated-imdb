Oh, brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for 18 years, all I can think about is the old Peggy Lee song ... <br /> <br /> "Is that all?" ... I was just a teenager when this smoked fish hit the United States. I was too young to enter the theater (although I managed to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then there was a screening at a local film museum. Finally, I was able to watch this movie, except now I was the same age as my parents when they saw it! <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason why this film was not condemned to the anonymous arenas of the time was due to the obscenity case caused by its launch in the United States. MILLIONS of people came to this stench, thinking that they were going to see a sex movie ... Instead, they got many close-ups of twisted and repulsive Swedes, street interviews in bland shopping malls, a political asinie pretense ... and weak who cares for simulated sex scenes with weak and pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, holy grail, historical artifact ... whatever it was, it destroys it, burns it, then puts the ashes in a lead box. <br /> <br /> Elite elites can still find courage in their boring pseudo-revolutionary political feats ... But if it were not for the scandal of censorship, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the rhythmic title "I Am Blank, Blank" was repeated endlessly for years as a degree for porn movies (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation movies, etc.) and every ten years or so, the thing rises from the dead, to be seen by a new generation of offspring who want to see that "naughty sex movie" that "evolved" the film industry "... <br /> <br /> Oh, avoid like the plague ... Or if you MUST see it: rent the video and go to the" dirty "parts, to end this. <br /> <br />
