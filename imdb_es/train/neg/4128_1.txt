This movie is one of the most horrible I've seen in my life. Dialogue is not only horrible, it never ends. You will think it is ending, but it is not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never see him again. It is as if someone took a romantic comedy, took out the comedy and then decided to downplay the romance, leaving us with the pile of garbage that managed to reach the screen. But do not trust my word, discover for yourself how terrible this movie is.
