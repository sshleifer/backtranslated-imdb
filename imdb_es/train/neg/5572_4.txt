Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight each other. This time, the travelers of the time of the future arrive in 1992 and recruit some people to return with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan from destruction. But having accomplished this task, it is revealed that the time travelers are a group of people who cross twice and that their own creature is in the uproar, and without Godzilla to stop it. Eek! Everything sounds very silly, and probably it is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle also looks pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are simply garbage, instead of nice garbage, and the film is as boring as its predecessors. Find the unstable joke of Spielberg.
