As if there were not enough of those who were floating at that moment, we have another clone of GODFATHER from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) that he had seen earlier this year. The name of marquee of value at this time is Telly Savalas, who enters the procedure late and sees himself for the first time from behind, taking care of his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters. Apart from not being minimally Sicilian, he has no accent of any kind other than his family accent. Antonio Sabato, then, becomes an unlikely gangster, in addition to being a resistant leader man; her relationship with Savalas, which becomes paternal in the blink of an eye, is not convincing either (especially since she later romantically gets involved with the adolescent niece of the latter). Also, for a gangster movie, there is a precious little action to talk about and none of them is memorable (although the end of a clinic is well managed); In addition, the score of Francesco De Masi is useful but nothing more. By the way, the bargain basement DVD that I rented starts at half the credits so that none of the cast members, not even the title of the movie, appears on the list.
