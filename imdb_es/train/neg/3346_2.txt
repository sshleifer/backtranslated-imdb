Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time military man who has retired to a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he will hang up. Things get dangerous when, while they watch a group of arrested students, some thieves take over the school as a base of operations for an armored car robbery. It's Dolph against the bad guys in a fight to the death. The fall of the jaw returns to the exploitation films of the era of recent times, where the bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had the shining hair of the day. What a stupid movie. You can not believe that people have done it this way, this is an action movie that was probably doomed from the beginning before the low budget, the sets of false escapes and the bad direction of the action were even a shine for the producers . Observe how late in the movie, when the cars pass through the school (do not ask), they hit the security turret (do not ask, since it looks more like a prison than a high school) and break their barely built form ( It does not seem that it did in previous shots). What have the gods of bad movies done? Actually, I'm perplexed as this was directed (?) By Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made movies like The Boys in Company C. Has his skill failed him, or did he have hopes from the beginning and he did not? ? even bother? It is a turkey. An observable, but a turkey, nonetheless.
