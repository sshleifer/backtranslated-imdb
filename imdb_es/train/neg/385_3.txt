Drama / misguided conspiracy mystery about the possibility that the government introduced AIDS to the public. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers, which within this fog plot would be hard to find for anyone. Although the cinematography itself is commendable, the camera craves characters of real depth rather than superficial action, unfortunately the amateur interpretation has to convey. Grade: D +
